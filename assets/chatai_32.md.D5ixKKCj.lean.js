Principled negotiation is a conflict resolution approach that focuses on principled decision-making, fair processes, and mutually beneficial outcomes. Here's how principled negotiation influenced the Good Friday Agreement: 1. Focus on Interests: Principled negotiation encourages parties to identify and address their underlying interests and needs rather than focusing solely on positions and demands. In the Good Friday Agreement, negotiators sought to understand the core interests and concerns of both unionists and nationalists to find common ground. This approach allowed for creative solutions that addressed the root causes of the conflict. 2. Generating Options: Principled negotiation emphasizes generating a wide range of options to address the interests and concerns of all parties involved. In the Good Friday Agreement, negotiators explored various solutions to contentious issues, such as power-sharing, policing, and the decommissioning of weapons. By considering multiple options, negotiators found compromises that balanced the interests and aspirations of different communities. 3. Collaborative Problem-Solving: Principled negotiation emphasizes collaboration and cooperation between adversarial parties. The Good Friday Agreement involved negotiators from different political parties, governments, and communities working together to find solutions. Collaborative problem-solving enabled the building of trust, fostering a sense of shared ownership, and enabling the creation of the power-sharing government. 4. Objective Criteria and Standards: Principled negotiation puts importance on objective criteria, fair standards, and principles to guide decision-making. In the Good Friday Agreement, negotiators considered principles such as human rights, equality, and democratic values when designing institutions and mechanisms. These objective criteria created a framework for justice, equality, and inclusivity. 5. Mutual Gains: Principled negotiation focuses on creating win-win outcomes, where all parties benefit from the agreement. In the Good Friday Agreement, negotiators aimed to create a framework that addressed the concerns of both unionists and nationalists. The power-sharing government and institutional arrangements allowed for both communities to have a stake in the governance of Northern Ireland, fostering a sense of shared benefits and opportunities. By incorporating principles of principled negotiation, the Good Friday Agreement sought to address underlying interests, build trust, encourage collaboration, and create sustainable and fair resolutions. These principles helped shape the agreement's structure, institutions, and mechanisms, contributing to the establishment of a framework for long-lasting peace and cooperation in Northern Ireland."},{"prompt":"alternatives if good friday agreement fell through","completion":"If the Good Friday Agreement had fallen through, several alternative scenarios and outcomes could have occurred in Northern Ireland. Here are a few possibilities: 1. Escalation of Violence: Without the Good Friday Agreement in place, a likely outcome would have been the continuation or escalation of violence. The paramilitary groups on both sides, such as the IRA (Irish Republican Army) and loyalist paramilitaries, could have intensified their attacks, leading to further bloodshed and destruction. 2. Increased Political Polarization: The absence of the Good Friday Agreement could have deepened political divisions and polarized communities in Northern Ireland. Without a power-sharing government, political representation and decision-making could have remained dominated by one particular community, leading to increased disillusionment and frustration among marginalized groups. 3. Prospects of Reunification: In the absence of the Good Friday Agreement, the prospects for a united Ireland could have gained momentum. The failure of power-sharing and ongoing violence may have pushed some nationalists to push for reunification with the Republic of Ireland as an alternative solution. 4. Hardened Borders: The reintroduction of physical borders between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland could have been a consequence if the Good Friday Agreement fell through. A hard border would have significant economic, social, and political implications, potentially disrupting trade, movement, and exacerbating tensions between communities. 5. International Intervention: In the event of the collapse of the Good Friday Agreement, there may have been increased international intervention to restore peace and stability. External actors, such as the British and Irish governments, as well as international bodies like the European Union and the United Nations, may have exerted efforts to revive negotiations and find alternative solutions. It is important to note that the consequences of the Good Friday Agreement falling through would have been highly unpredictable and volatile. The Agreement's success in providing a framework for peace, reconciliation, and shared governance in Northern Ireland has been instrumental in preventing a return to the levels of violence and conflict experienced during The Troubles."},{"prompt":"power dynamics, external influences, and individual leadership qualities in the good friday agreement","completion":"The Good Friday Agreement was influenced by several factors, including power dynamics, external influences, and individual leadership qualities. Here's a breakdown of each: Power Dynamics: 1. Balance of Power: The negotiations sought to address the power imbalance between unionists and nationalists in Northern Ireland. The power-sharing arrangements in the Agreement aimed to ensure that both communities had a significant say in the political decision-making process, thereby addressing concerns about marginalization and discrimination. 2. Paramilitary Influence: The presence and influence of paramilitary groups, such as the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries, shaped the power dynamics during the negotiations. These groups had significant control over certain communities and had to be taken into account to achieve a sustainable peace agreement. External Influences: 1. British and Irish Governments: The British and Irish governments played a crucial role in supporting and driving the peace process. Their involvement included facilitating negotiations, offering incentives, providing resources, and ensuring that any agreement had their political backing. 2. International Community: External actors, including the United States and the European Union, also played a role in influencing the peace process. They provided diplomatic support, financial aid, and acted as impartial intermediaries, helping to create an atmosphere conducive to dialogue and compromise. Individual Leadership Qualities: 1. George Mitchell: George Mitchell's leadership and diplomatic skills as the independent chair of the talks were vital in facilitating dialogue and maintaining progress. His impartiality, persistence, and ability to build trust among the parties involved played a significant role in the successful negotiation and implementation of the Agreement. 2. Political Leaders: Key political leaders, such as John Hume of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and David Trimble of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), demonstrated leadership qualities by making difficult compromises and taking risks, even within their own communities. Their determination and willingness to engage in negotiations were instrumental in advancing the peace process. 3. Community Leaders: Various community leaders, both from unionist and nationalist backgrounds, played significant roles in bridging divides and fostering dialogue at the grassroots level. Their leadership qualities and ability to work toward reconciliation helped build trust within their communities and contributed to the overall success of the Agreement. In summary, power dynamics, external influences, and individual leadership qualities all intersected and influenced the Good Friday Agreement. Balancing power, external support, and effective leadership were critical in creating an environment conducive to negotiation, compromise, and the ultimate achievement of the peace agreement."},{"prompt":"Translate to English \\"ゆるキャラ人気の立役者！？ 着ぐるみの魅力とは？ 『カブルモン』（藤堂あきと/芳文社） ひこにゃん、せんとくん、くまモン、バリィさん…。世は空前のゆるキャラブームだが、人気の背景には着ぐるみとしての魅力も多いに関係あるだろう。実際、ゆるキャラや遊園地のマスコットキャラクター、戦隊もののヒーローたちのように、着ぐるみを着ることにはどんな利点があるのだろうか？ 6月7日に発売された『カブルモン』（藤堂あきと/芳文社）には、着ぐるみを楽しむ“カブルモン部”が登場する。このカブルモン部には、部長で着ぐるみ制作を担当している素川瑞穂とスーツアクターを目指している蜂須賀友紀。2人の着ぐるみパフォーマンスを見て惹かれた1年生の主人公・高沢和葉とそのクラスメイト・一二見早苗が所属しているのだが、彼女たちの活動から着ぐるみの魅力について探ってみよう。 まず、瑞穂いわく「着ぐるみは動物にも怪獣にも男女の区別もなく誰でも同じキャラになれる」のだ。たしかに、着ぐるみを着れば誰もが遊園地のマスコットキャラクターやくまモン、バリィさんにだって変身できちゃう。でも、誰がやっても同じだからこそ動きや細かい部分がポイントになってくるのだ。最初に先生の被り物を被ってパフォーマンスをしていた友紀は、普段は右利きなのに先生を演じるために左利きでパフォーマンスするし、カクカクした動き方も完璧にコピーしていた。誰が入っても同じだからこそ、そのキャラクターに共通する動きやパフォーマンスが必要になってくる。そういったキャラ付けができているからこそ、今のゆるキャラたちがこれほどまでに人気を得たのだろう。 また、顔が見えないので羞恥心も減り、心からなりきることができたり、冷静に相手の反応を見ることもできるのも大きい。なりきるという点ではコスプレも同じかもしれないが、顔が隠れているというだけでコスプレよりもさらに自分じゃないものになりきることができる。人とうまくしゃべれない和葉は、「私…顔なんて出したらきっと立ちすくんじゃう」と言っていたが、いざ着ぐるみに入ってお面をつけるとそのとたん役になりきり、廊下で決めポーズをしたり、こけても平然としていられる。友紀が「正体わかんないのも気持ちいいよねぇ～」と言うのだが、たしかに自分だとバレていないからどんなことでもできるし、みんなに笑ってもらえて楽しくなるのだ。自分がどんな顔、表情でいるのかはお客さんにバレないし、逆にお客さんの反応を冷静に伺いながら行動できるのも着ぐるみの強みなのかも。 そして、着ぐるみを着てパフォーマンスするには衣装を作ったり、隣でサポートしてくれる仲間が必要。和葉が急遽ヒーローショーの代役として出ることになったときも、フラフラになって倒れたところをスタッフが「あーあるある」と言ってテキパキと着ぐるみを脱がせ、介抱してくれる。それに、着ぐるみの隣には必ずサポート役の人がつく。狭い場所を歩くときやトイレに行きたくなったとき、何かトラブルがあったときのためにサインを決めておいてサポート役の人が助けてあげるのだ。初めてのイベントで和葉が人の波にのまれそうになっていたときも、早苗が身を挺して必死に守ってくれる。こんなふうに、仲間との絆や信頼関係があるからこそ、着ぐるみの中の人が安心して思いっきりパフォーマンスすることができるのだ。 この本を読めば、あなたもきっと着ぐるみの中の人になってみたくなる？ 文＝小里樹\\"","completion":"The Catalyst of the Yuru-Chara Craze?! The Allure of Wearing Mascots? \\"Kaburumon\\" (by Akito Toudou, Houbunsha) Hikonyan, Sentokun, Kumamon, Bari-san... The world is currently experiencing an unprecedented Yuru-Chara boom, and the charm of wearing mascots is likely a significant factor behind its popularity. Indeed, whether it's Yuru-Chara, amusement park mascots, or Super Sentai heroes, what are the advantages of wearing a mascot costume? In \\"Kaburumon\\" (by Akito Toudou, Houbunsha), released on June 7th, there is a \\"Kaburumon Club\\" dedicated to enjoying mascot costumes. This club consists of club president Mizuho Sugawa, who is responsible for making the costumes, and Yuki Hasushuga, who aspires to be a suit actor. The first-year protagonist, Kazuha Takasawa, and her classmate, Hazae Ichinomiya, became interested in joining the club after seeing the performances of these two with the mascot costumes. Let's explore the allure of mascot costumes through their activities. Firstly, according to Mizuho, \\"Mascot costumes allow anyone to become the same character, regardless of gender or whether it's an animal or a monster.\\" It's true that anyone can transform into amusement park mascots or characters like Kumamon or Bari-san simply by putting on a mascot costume. However, because it's the same character no matter who wears it, the emphasis lies in the movements and finer details. Originally, Yuki imitated the teacher's performance by wearing the teacher's hat, even though she is right-handed, she performed as if she was left-handed. She also perfectly copied the teacher's stiff movements. Because anyone can wear the costume, it becomes necessary to have common movements and performances that characterize that particular character. It is likely due to such characterizations that the current Yuru-Chara characters have gained such immense popularity. Additionally, not being able to see their faces reduces embarrassment and allows performers to immerse themselves completely. It also enables them to calmly observe the reactions of others. This aspect may be similar to cosplay in terms of becoming someone else, but simply hiding one's face allows for an even greater transformation. Kazuha, who struggles to communicate with others, said, \\"If I show my face, I'll surely freeze up,\\" but the moment she puts on a mascot costume and a mask, she fully immerses herself in the role and can strike poses in the hallway or fall without worry. Yuki says, \\"It's so refreshing not being recognized,\\" and indeed, not being recognized allows them to do anything and enjoy it when others laugh. They can't see their own facial expression, but others can't see it either. In fact, being able to calmly observe the audience's reactions may be one of the strengths of wearing a mascot costume. Furthermore, wearing mascot costumes and performing requires creating costumes and having supportive friends nearby. Even when Kazuha suddenly had to fill in as a substitute for a hero show and became dizzy and collapsed, the staff immediately took off her costume and took care of her, saying, \\"It happens, don't worry.\\" Additionally, a supportive staff member always accompanies the person wearing the mascot costume. They have predetermined signals in case they need help while walking in narrow spaces or when they need to use the restroom. When there is trouble, the supportive staff member is there to assist. When Kazuha was about to be swept away by a crowd during her first event, Hazae risked her own safety to protect her. It is because of such bonds and trust among friends that the person inside the mascot costume can perform with peace of mind. After reading this book, will you also want to become the person inside a mascot costume?

Utilize tax deductions: Take advantage of various deductions under Section 80C (e.g. investments in Provident Fund, Life Insurance Premiums, National Savings Certificates, etc.) and other applicable sections of the Income Tax Act. This can significantly reduce your taxable income. 2. Optimize investments: Explore tax-saving investment options such as the National Pension Scheme (NPS), Equity-Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS), or tax-saving fixed deposits. These investments offer tax benefits under specific sections of the Income Tax Act. 3. Claim House Rent Allowance (HRA): If you are paying rent for accommodation, ensure you claim the HRA exemption available under Section 10(13A) of the Income Tax Act. This can help in reducing your taxable income. 4. Use allowances and perks: Optimize allowances like travel allowance, medical allowance, food coupons, etc., that are exempted up to specific limits. Consult with your employer to explore such options. 5. Structure salary components efficiently: Discuss with your employer to structure your salary components in a way that focuses on non-taxable components like reimbursements, medical benefits, and performance-based bonuses rather than taxable components. 6.

It provides a way to access the elements of a collection without exposing its underlying structure. The iterator interface typically includes methods like \`hasNext()\` to check if there are more elements to iterate over, and \`next()\` to retrieve the next element in the collection. By using an iterator, you can iterate over a collection without knowing its specific implementation details. This makes the code more flexible and decoupled from the underlying data structure. Here is an example of using an iterator in Java: \`\`\` List<String> names = new ArrayList<>(); names.add(\\"John\\"); names.add(\\"Sarah\\"); names.add(\\"Michael\\"); Iterator<String> iterator = names.iterator(); while (iterator.hasNext()) { String name = iterator.next(); System.out.println(name); } \`\`\` In this example, the iterator is obtained from the \`names\` list using the \`iterator()\` method. The \`hasNext()\` method is used to check if there are more elements, and the \`next()\` method is used to retrieve each element one by one and print it out."},{"prompt":"Iterator","completion":"An iterator is an object that allows iteration over a collection of elements, such as an array or a list. It provides a way to access the elements of a collection one by one, without exposing its underlying representation. Iterators typically have methods like \`next()\`, which returns the next element in the collection, and \`hasNext()\`, which checks if there are any more elements left to iterate over. The use of iterators allows for a more flexible and efficient way of traversing collections, as it separates the traversal logic from the specific implementation of the collection. It also enables lazy evaluation, where elements are accessed on-demand, which can be useful for large or infinite collections. In many programming languages, iterators are implemented using the Iterator design pattern, which defines a common interface for iterating over different types of collections. Some languages provide built-in support for iterators, while others require the programmer to implement their own iterator classes or interfaces."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

CITY OF NEW YORK, ET AL. The plaintiff has brought suite against the NYPD for false arrest following his acquittal on charges of disorderly conduct. In response, the defense has filed a motion to dismiss based on qualified immunity. Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, qualified immunity may apply where (1) an individual is acting in an official capacity, (2) that individual violates someone’s constitutional right(s), and (3) the individual did not violate a clearly established right. By meeting all three elements overall, individual defendants in a civil rights case can absolve themselves of personal liability for the injuries the plaintiff incurred from the violation. It is the plaintiff’s burden to prove the defendants are not exempt from liability. As for the third element, the defense automatically satisfies arguable probable cause if they meet the requirements for probable cause. Those requirements are that (1) they know of the facts and circumstances of the situation, (2) their knowledge of those facts and circumstances is reliable, and (3) based on that knowledge, a reasonable person would believe a crime is in progress. (Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132). Under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) controlling motions to dismiss, the defendant bears the burden of establishing that the plaintiff failed to state their claim, and the court must interpret the facts of the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. If the plaintiff cannot establish a factual basis for the complaint, the court grants the motion to dismiss. The plaintiff brings a claim against the defendants for false arrest, having been acquitted on a charge for disorderly conduct. For the purposes of this memo, we assume that the defendants, acting in their capacity as officers for the NYPD, violated the plaintiff’s Fourth Amendment right, satisfying elements one and two of qualified immunity. We additionally stipulate that the defendants did not have probable when they arrested the plaintiff. Foregoing an analysis of probable cause, false arrest, and disorderly conduct, this memo will analyze the arguable probable cause facet of qualified immunity to determine the likelihood that the plaintiff can overcome the qualified immunity barrier and proceed to his suite for false arrest. STATEMENT OF FACTS On August 16th, 2022, plaintiff Darius Strucker, hereafter Strucker or Mr. Strucker, was approached by New York Police Department’s Officer Miller on a street corner outside of his home. Officer Miller and her colleagues, Officer McLoughlin and Officer #3, arrived in response to a disturbance amongst Mr. Strucker’s neighbors that had ended by the time they arrived. Officer Miller and Mr. Strucker had adversarial experiences with one another through Strucker’s late brother, who was often in trouble with the law before he died. Strucker believed that Miller was prejudiced against him because of this and because he is Black. Mr. Strucker did not produce identification for Officer Miller upon her request, believing she only approached him to antagonize him. They began to argue, however when Officer McLoughlin approached and asked what was going on, Officer Miller falsely stated that Strucker threatened and aggressed against her. McLoughlin and three other NYPD officers then proceeded to restrain Mr. Strucker, who cursed and yelled at Officer Miller. A few of Strucker’s neighbors were nearby during the incident and pleaded with the officers to leave Mr. Strucker alone, stating that Strucker had not done anything to Miller. The officers ignored these pleas, placed Strucker in a patrol vehicle after handcuffing him, and charged him with disorderly conduct as well as resisting arrest. A jury acquitted Mr. Strucker on all charges. He has filed suit against New York City, the New York Police Department, and the individual officers involved for violating his Fourth Amendment rights through false arrest. I. CAN THE PLAINTIFF ESTABLISH THAT THE DEFENDANTS DID NOT HAVE ARGUABLE PROBABLE CAUSE TO ARREST HIM FOR DISORDERLY CONDUCT? To overcome arguable probable cause, the plaintiff must establish that the defendants violated a clearly established right, that a reasonable police officer would understand their actions violated that right, and that a reasonable police officer would understand there was no actual probable cause. Here, the plaintiff will likely fall short of establishing that his right to be free from arrest while yelling and swearing at the police was clearly established because controlling caselaw at the time of his arrest did not affirm that right with sufficient specificity as to put the defendants on notice. Their lack of notice notwithstanding, a reasonable police officer in the defendants’ position would have understood that they violated the plaintiff’s rights, because at least one of them knowingly precipitated the arrest based on false information and made no efforts to ensure his rights. Lastly, the plaintiff can likely establish that reasonable officers would perceive no probable cause; based on the observations they could have easily made, the plaintiff had not caused nor was he in the process of causing the public harm that is paramount to disorderly conduct. Nevertheless, the plaintiff is unlikely to overcome the obstacle of arguable probable cause, because he will struggle to satisfy the element requiring a clearly established right. A. PLAINTIFF’S RIGHT TO BE FREE FROM ARREST WHILE YELLING AND CURSING AT THE POLICE WAS NOT CLEARLY ESTABLISHED. Arguable probable cause applies under some circumstances in which the defendant has violated the right of the plaintiff. The right not having been clearly established at the time of the violation mitigates officers’ culpability over the violation (Wilson v. Layne). For example, the court has illustrated that, where previous case law did not explicitly exalt the right in question, the right was not clearly established. The policy behind this facet of qualified immunity is to elucidate both the general population and those in official positions as to expectations for the officials’ conduct. Furthermore, it spares officials “unwarranted liability,” and promotes efficiency within the judicial system. (Id., at 609). The court in Wilson held that the right in question was not clearly established because no precedent explicitly articulated the right. The Second Circuit later affirmed the right to be free from arrest while yelling at the police because the plaintiff in this case had a practical reason engaging in this conduct. The Supreme Court has also held that, where precedent upholds a right, the right is not clearly established if it is not specifically stated and highly attuned to the case in question. (Anderson v. Creighton). Here, the right in question is the right to be free from arrest for disorderly conduct when yelling and cursing at the police. The officers did not violate Mr. Strucker’s right to be free from arrest when yelling and cursing at the police because this right was not clearly established with sufficient specificity to the facts of this case in existing caselaw. The plaintiff in Provost v. City of Newburgh was arrested and later relieved of culpability for disorderly conduct after yelling at the police. This plaintiff overcame qualified immunity because his practical and demonstrable purpose for yelling was to be heard rather than to cause public harm. Here, Mr. Strucker may not have intended public harm, however he had no practical purpose for raising his voice at the police; even interpreting the facts in the light most favorable to Mr. Strucker, his apparent reason for his conduct was that he believed Officer Miller held a bias against him due to his brother’s criminal history. The plaintiff in Anderson did not have a clearly established right because the right he cited was so broad, the defendant did not have adequate notice as to what actions violated that right or how far the plaintiff could carry out the right. In the physical and emotional tumult of his arrest, Mr. Strucker raised his voice and used profane language against the police. The reason for Strucker’s yelling aside, he may have the right to raise his voice at police; however, Provost does not exalt any right to yell obscenities at the police. Therefore, the court would likely find that Strucker’s right to remain free from arrest while yelling and swearing at the police was not clearly established; he would likely fail to overcome this element of arguable probable cause. B. A REASONABLE POLICE OFFICER IN THE DEFENDANTS’ POSITION WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR ACTIONS VIOLATED PLAINTIFF’S RIGHT TO BE FREE FROM ARREST WHILE YELLING AND CURSING AT POLICE. A reasonable officer would not believe their actions violated constituted a violation of plaintiff’s rights if they were proactive in attempts to safeguard those rights or if, in taking the actions they did, they relied on information they believed was accurate. A reasonable police officer can also believe their actions do not violate the plaintiff’s rights if those actions comport with policy. This requirement for arguable probable cause discourages officials from abusing their power by knowingly transgressing in their roles as government agents. The Second Circuit determined that the defendant knowingly failed to act as a reasonable police officer after he blatantly disregarded standards forbidding officers to assault detainees during arrests. (Weyent v. Okst). The Second Circuit found it reasonable for an officer to believe her actions did not violate the plaintiff’s clearly established rights because those actions were prompted by either personal knowledge or information from others she deemed credible. (Escalera v. Lunn). Additionally, the Secind Circuit determined that the same officer’s judgement was in harmony with the plaintiff’s clearly established rights when she made thorough efforts to preserve those rights. (Id.). Here, the court would likely find that a reasonable officer in the defendants’ position would know they violated Mr. Strucker’s rights because they did not adhere to policy, knowingly arrested him based on false information, and made no efforts to protect Mr. Strucker’s rights. Weyent originating from the same jurisdiction as the present case, the policy against excessive force during arrest is applicable. Here, the officer McLoughlin exerted enough force to tear the plaintiff’s rotator cuff, agitated this injury while he was handcuffed, and did so without the plaintiff first aggressing. Like the defendant officer in Escalera, Officer McLoughlin detained plaintiff, finding Officer Miller credible when she stated the plaintiff threatened her. McLoughlin’s assessment of Miller’s credibility notwithstanding, Miller herself took part in and encouraged the violation. Interpreting the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, we must assume that she precipitated the violation knowing that the information she provided leading up to it was not accurate. Additionally, the defendants made little effort to ensure their actions did not violate the plaintiff’s rights; they arrested him without probable cause, did not have a warrant, and ignored witnesses who stressed that the plaintiff had not harmed anyone. This is in contrast with the defendant officer in Escalera, who interviewed multiple witnesses, collected affidavits, and took other investigative steps before she determined it was appropriate to seek a warrant for his arrest. Overall, these factors indicate that a reasonable police officer would not have found the defendants’ actions to comport with the Strucker’s right to be free from arrest. Therefore, on this element of arguable probable cause, the Strucker would likely succeed. C. A REASONABLE POLICE OFFICER WOULD LIKELY HAVE UNDERSTOOD THERE WAS NO GROUNDS TO ARREST PLAINTIFF ON DISORDERLY CONDUCT. A plaintiff bringing action against a government actor under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for false arrest must establish that a reasonable police officer would understand no probable cause existed at the time of their arrest. If reasonable officers could disagree as to whether they perceived grounds to arrest, the plaintiff cannot overcome qualified immunity. (Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335). In the context of this case, the probable cause in question applies to disorderly conduct, which entails intent to cause public harm by making unreasonable noise, using profane language in a public place, or using profane gestures in the same setting. (N.Y. Penal Law § 240.20). Subsections of this statute include (2) making unreasonable noise and (3) using profane gestures or language in a public place. (Id). A reasonable officer would understand that probable cause to arrest for disorderly conduct does not exist if the plaintiff’s unreasonable noise or obscene behavior did not provoke a negative reaction from the public, if the plaintiff did not encourage others to get involved in the incident, or if there was not a large crowd in the vicinity. (Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire; Zellner v. Summerlin; Weyent v. Okst). The Supreme Court determined in Chaplinsky that a reasonable officer would not believe an arrest was unwarranted after the plaintiff used a public sidewalk to proclaim the superiority of his religion. This was a crowded location, and people in the area became restless. In response, an officer escorted the plaintiff away, and he cursed at him. In contrast, the Zellner court found that no reasonable officer would confer probable cause in the plaintiff’s actions; in this case, the plaintiff neither raised his voice, swore, addressed the crowd around him, or provoked any reaction from them. Lastly, the Second Circuit in Weyent concluded that there was no perceivable, reasonable grounds for arrest because there were no members of the public in the plaintiffs’ vicinity; this spoke to their lack of intent or recklessness regarding public harm. Here, a reasonable police officer would believe there was no grounds to arrest Mr. Strucker because he did not elicit a negative response from onlookers and did not encourage their participation in the incident. Additionally, he did not disrupt a large group of people. Like the plaintiff in Zellner, Mr. Strucker addressed only the police and initially did so without yelling or swearing. Although there were others in the vicinity, this aspect of Mr. Strucker’s case is more consistent with Weygent. Strucker refers to onlookers as being “a few” or “a couple,” as opposed to the swaths of people described in Chaplinsky. This indicates he did not intend public harm. Furthermore, upon the officers’ arrival on the scene, both Mr. Strucker and the people around him were calm. This would indicate to the officers that he did not inflict public harm before they arrived. In further contrast with Chaplinsky, witnesses to Strucker’s incident were upset and pled with the police; however, their dismay was to the officers’ treatment of him rather than to his conduct. Although he swore at them and raised his voice like the plaintiff in Chaplinsky, the public disturbance was caused by the police rather than Mr. Strucker. Therefore, a reasonable police officer would understand that there was no probable cause, and Mr. Strucker would likely overcome this element of arguable probable cause. D. OVERALL CONCLUSION Because it is an element-based rather than a factor-based concept, Mr. Strucker must satisfy every aspect of arguable probable cause. Although he can likely establish that a reasonable police officer would both perceive the lack of probable cause and understand that the NYPD’s actions violated Mr. Strucker’s right to be free from arrest under the circumstances, Mr. Strucker would have difficulty convincing the court that the officers violated a clearly established right to be free from arrest while yelling and swearing at the police. A counterargument might highlight caselaw that parses out the severity with which certain swear words are perceived. For example, the court stipulated in People v. Gingello that an individual who called a police officer an asshole did not merit arrest for disorderly conduct because our society no longer finds this language offensive. Under this argument, Mr. Strucker might even contend that his words were strong but not swear words. However, this theory would still be called into question by the Supreme Court’s decision in Chaplinsky. Having created the fighting words doctrine that limited free speech to words that do no incite violence, Chaplinsky does not define exactly which words are swear words and which words are not, therefore Mr. Strucker’s right to be free from arrest while yelling and swearing is not clearly established.","completion":"To: Supervising attorney From: Nalini Singh Re: Interoffice memo Date: June 25th, 2023 PERSUASIVE ANALYSIS OF STRUCKER V. CITY OF NEW YORK, ET AL. The plaintiff has brought suite against the NYPD for false arrest following his acquittal on charges of disorderly conduct. In response, the defense has filed a motion to dismiss based on qualified immunity. Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, qualified immunity may apply where (1) an individual is acting in an official capacity, (2) that individual allegedly violates someone’s constitutional right(s), and (3) the individual did not violate a clearly established right. By meeting all three elements overall, individual defendants in a civil rights case can protect themselves from personal liability for the injuries the plaintiff incurred. It is the plaintiff’s burden to prove the defendants are not exempt from liability. As for the third element, the defense automatically satisfies arguable probable cause if they meet the requirements for probable cause. Those requirements are that (1) they know of the facts and circumstances of the situation, (2) their knowledge of those facts and circumstances is reliable, and (3) based on that knowledge, a reasonable person would believe a crime is in progress. (Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132). Under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) controlling motions to dismiss, the defendant bears the burden of proving that the plaintiff failed to state their claim, and the court must interpret the facts of the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. If the plaintiff cannot establish a factual basis for the complaint, the court grants the motion to dismiss. The plaintiff brings a claim against the defendants for false arrest, having been acquitted on a charge for disorderly conduct. For the purposes of this memo, we assume that the defendants, acting in their capacity as officers for the NYPD, allegedly violated the plaintiff’s Fourth Amendment right, satisfying elements one and two of qualified immunity. We additionally stipulate that the defendants did not have probable when they arrested the plaintiff. Without thoroughly analyzing probable cause, false arrest, and disorderly conduct, this memo will focus on the arguable probable cause facet of qualified immunity to assess the likelihood that the plaintiff can overcome the qualified immunity barrier and proceed with his case for false arrest. STATEMENT OF FACTS On August 16th, 2022, plaintiff Darius Strucker, hereafter Strucker or Mr. Strucker, was approached by New York Police Department’s Officer Miller on a street corner outside of his home. Officer Miller and her colleagues, Officer McLoughlin and Officer #3, arrived in response to a disturbance amongst Mr. Strucker’s neighbors that had ended before their arrival. Officer Miller and Mr. Strucker had a strained relationship stemming from Strucker’s late brother, who had a history of legal issues. Strucker believed that Miller held prejudice against him because of this and because of his race. Mr. Strucker refused to provide identification to Officer Miller upon her request, assuming she only approached him to provoke him. They engaged in an argument, and when Officer McLoughlin intervened and inquired about the situation, Officer Miller falsely claimed that Strucker had threatened and assaulted her. McLoughlin and three other NYPD officers then proceeded to restrain Mr. Strucker, who expressed his frustration and yelled at Officer Miller. A few of Strucker’s neighbors witnessed the incident and tried to persuade the officers to release Mr. Strucker, insisting that he had not harmed Miller. Disregarding their pleas, the officers handcuffed Mr"},{"prompt":"Act as a python expert. Your task is to say 'hi' first then do the following.

I can't 100% guarantee what may happen if you try using a pre-existing holotape to switch to single menu on the new update, but if you do, I highly recommend you run Settlement Menu Manager's menu fix holotape afterwards to ensure everything is properly installed. Version 1.74 implements Settlement Menu Manager as the preferred method of menu injection. Though this should work on previous saves as the menu has already been injected, keep in mind this will require that mod from now on. Known Issues: Many navmeshed items do not have proper navcuts or properly developed navmeshes due to my relative inexperience at the time of making this. Damanding has said he will look into this, but he also has a bunch of other projects, so don't try and rush him! The mod has been saved with the current version of the creation kit, which has updated its mod header and can cause issues with people running VR or older versions of the game. This can be fixed with changing the version header from 1.0 to 0.95 in xEdit, but no support will be given for users running outdated versions. Future potential updates may be given reasonable exception windows. The Institute monitors (with the CCTV Screens) in the Decorative/Misc/Electronics section will flash rapidly upon selection. People who are sensitive to sudden flashing lights should avoid these objects for now; luckily they are at the end of the section. The Institute Consoles and Wall monitor have issues with clipping through walls due to their size, and will jut out the back. This is only cosmetic, and is not entirely aesthetically unpleasing (see my exterior house screenshot for an example). In addition, the larger wall mounted consoles tend to move right up to the front of the camera when they are placed, so when placing them try and get as close to the wall as possible. I've found placing them once and then picking them back up makes them slightly less spastic. For generators, wires do not tend to neatly attach themselves to the connect points, but this is due to them not having power connectors on the model. Many of the smaller lights (desk lights, table lights) are movable static objects, and will fall over if you bump them. This sounds nice, but the workshop placement engine is not capable of righting them again, and they are unable to be picked back up once knocked over by holding \\"e\\". I found a potential fix which allows them to be picked up and carried at the expense of being unscrappable. I will keep trying to get find an ideal fix for this issue. Fixed in 1.74! Some of the lights models are permanently set to look either \\"off\\" or \\"on\\", or will vary between the two seemingly at random. This is an issue with how Bethesda decided to categorize light models, and should be fixable with the GECK. In the meantime, I was able to fix things by saving and reloading. Here are some solutions that have been found to some of the more common issues people have been having with the mod: Crashing when selecting the Fence or BoS Fence category - this is a crash due to a corrupted nif that was fixed in 1.73. Update the mod to fix this. Thanks again to Keetz for implementing a fix. Missing Institute items - This is not necessarily a bug, more of a misunderstanding. If you want to use the Institute items when not a member (or no longer a member) of the Institute, use the Unlocked Institute Objects patch included with the mod to get access to this content. Translations Thanks to everyone who helped translate the mod so far! There's so many now I don't feel its fair singling out just a couple, but your work is appreciated!

Trong đó, không thể không kể đến tầm quan trọng của dữ liệu lớn (big data) trong trường hợp này. Thách thức đầu tiên có thể kể đến đó chính là việc thiếu thông tin và dữ liệu. Một hệ thống CRM hiệu quả đòi hỏi dữ liệu và thông tin chính xác và đầy đủ. Tuy nhiên, công ty thường phải đối mặt với việc thiếu thông tin hoặc dữ liệu không chính xác từ các nguồn khác nhau. Việc sắp xếp, cập nhật và làm sạch dữ liệu có thể là một thách thức đối với các công ty. Điều này có thể xảy ra khi các doanh nghiệp thiếu hỗ trợ kỹ thuật và chuyên môn. CRM với dữ liệu lớn có thể cần nhiều công cụ phân tích dữ liệu dễ sử dụng hơn trong việc tạo báo cáo, đặc biệt là khi liên quan đến việc sử dụng dữ liệu một cách thích hợp trên các kênh. Ngoài ra còn liên quan đến tính xác thực của dữ liệu với sự quan tâm đến nguồn dữ liệu từ các tệp ghi chú web, mạng xã hội, nội dung doanh nghiệp, giao dịch, ứng dụng dữ liệu có thể cần một quyền lực hợp lệ của thông tin để đảm bảo tính xác thực và an toàn. Hệ thống CRM chứa nhiều thông tin quan trọng về khách hàng và công ty. Điều này yêu cầu các công ty phải có các biện pháp bảo mật và quản lý quyền riêng tư đảm bảo rằng dữ liệu không bị lộ ra ngoài hoặc sử dụng sai mục đích. Thứ hai, bàn về chính sách và cách thức triển khai thực hiện không đồng nhất trong quy trình và trên hệ thống. Mỗi bộ phận trong một công ty có thể có quy trình riêng và sử dụng các hệ thống khác nhau. Điều này có thể gây khó khăn trong việc tích hợp hệ thống CRM để đảm bảo sự liên tục và khả năng chia sẻ thông tin cho toàn bộ công ty. Ngoài ra, doanh nghiệp có thể gặp khó khăn trong việc tạo sự đồng thuận và hỗ trợ từ lãnh đạo. Đó là vì hệ thống CRM có thể đòi hỏi sự thay đổi trong quy trình và tổ chức công ty, và có thể gặp phải sự không đồng thuận từ các bộ phận hoặc nhân viên không mong muốn thay đổi. Ngoài ra, triển khai hệ thống CRM có thể yêu cầu sự thay đổi về quy trình, cách thức làm việc và tư duy của công ty. Điều này có thể gây khó khăn trong việc tạo sự thay đổi và sự chấp nhận từ cộng đồng nhân viên. Thứ ba, khả năng huấn luyện và chuyển đổi nhân viên. Sự thành công hay thất bại của hệ thống CRM phụ thuộc lớn nhất vào việc nhân viên được huấn luyện và chấp nhận sử dụng nó một cách hiệu quả hay không. Việc huấn luyện và chuyển đổi nhân viên có thể tốn kém và đòi hỏi thời gian và tài nguyên. Thứ tư phải kể đính tính kết nối và tương thích của hệ thống CRM với các hệ thống khác. Một công ty có thể sử dụng nhiều hệ thống khác nhau như hệ thống quản lý doanh nghiệp (ERP), hệ thống quản lý quan hệ với nguồn lực (HRM) hoặc hệ thống quản lý dự án (PMS). Điều này yêu cầu tích hợp hệ thống CRM với các hệ thống khác để chia sẻ thông tin và tạo một hệ thống toàn diện. Cuối cùng, tất cả các hệ thống đều cần phải được đo lường nếu đã được doanh nghiệp đưa vào thực tế để sử dụng, trong đó đo lường hiệu suất để đảm bảo rằng hệ thống CRM đang hoạt động hiệu quả, công ty cần xác định các chỉ số hiệu suất và đo lường sự thành công. Điều này đòi hỏi việc thiết lập các mục tiêu rõ ràng và tạo ra các cơ chế đo lường và theo dõi kịp thời. • Điều này có thể xảy ra khi các doanh nghiệp thiếu hỗ trợ kỹ thuật và chuyên môn. • Khi khách hàng di chuyển từ nhận thức về thương hiệu đến việc chuyển đổi, là khó khăn. Nó là một thách thức để kết nối các điểm từ kênh trực tuyến đến kênh ngoại tuyến, chẳng hạn như khi và nơi mà khách hàng thấy hoặc đọc về một sản phẩm để cuối cùng mua sản phẩm đó. • CRM với dữ liệu lớn có thể cần nhiều công cụ phân tích dữ liệu dễ sử dụng hơn trong việc tạo báo cáo, đặc biệt là khi liên quan đến việc sử dụng dữ liệu một cách thích hợp trên các kênh. • Thách thức cuối cùng liên quan đến tính xác thực của dữ liệu với sự quan tâm đến nguồn dữ liệu từ các tệp ghi chú web, mạng xã hội, nội dung doanh nghiệp, giao dịch, ứng dụng dữ liệu có thể cần một quyền lực hợp lệ của thông tin để đảm bảo tính xác thực và an toàn.\\"","completion":"When businesses implement CRM systems, they need to consider several factors to avoid common challenges that they often encounter: 1. Lack of Information and Data: - CRM systems require accurate and complete data and information. However, companies often face the challenge of missing or inaccurate data from various sources. - Organizing, updating, and cleaning data can be a challenge for companies, especially when they lack technical support and expertise. - CRM systems with big data may require more user-friendly data analysis tools for generating reports, especially when it comes to proper utilization of data across channels. - Ensuring data authenticity and security is important, considering data from web notes, social media, company content, transactions, and data applications. 2. Inconsistent Policies and Implementation Methods: - Each department within a company may have its own processes and different systems in place, making integration of CRM systems challenging for ensuring continuity and information sharing throughout the company. - Creating consensus and support from the leadership can be difficult as implementing CRM systems may require changes in processes and organizational structure, often met with resistance from departments or employees who are resistant to change. - Implementing CRM systems may also require changes in workflows, work methodologies, and the mindset of the company, which can also hinder employee acceptance and change. 3. Training and Employee Adoption: - The success or failure of a CRM system largely depends on whether employees are effectively trained and willing to use it. - Training and employee adoption can be costly and time-consuming, requiring resources and time investment. 4. Integration and Compatibility: - Companies may use multiple systems such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Human Resource Management (HRM), or Project Management Systems (PMS), requiring integration of CRM systems with other systems to share information and create a comprehensive system. 5. Measuring Performance: - All systems need to be measured once implemented to ensure they are effectively used. For CRM systems, measuring performance is essential. - Setting clear goals and establishing measurement mechanisms and timely monitoring are necessary to ensure the effectiveness of the CRM system. In addition to the above challenges, customer journey from brand awareness to conversion can be difficult, especially when connecting online channels with offline channels. The use of user-friendly data analysis tools is also essential for CRM systems with big data to ensure proper utilization of data across channels. Lastly, ensuring data authenticity and security is crucial, putting importance on valid information sources to ensure authenticity and safety of data within the CRM system."},{"prompt":"dịch tiếng việt \\"As more firms practise CRM, the question of how to evaluate performance remains a significant challenge, and there is a strong tendency for research to emphasise one dimension of CRM performance while ignoring others, which makes it much more difficult for managers to make a deep understanding of the practical implications of different performance measures. Few studies, if any, have been conducted to examine the differential effects of individual dimensions of customer value on the specific dimensions of CRM performance. This makes it almost impossible for managers to determine and identify those value creation and delivery processes and activities that contribute the most to the intended performance aspect of CRM to maximize customer equity of their firms. In practice, empirically investigating the effects of key dimensions of customer value is extremely important – because the delivery of superior customer value can involve significant costs for firms. In some cases, there can be concern that such costs could outweigh the potential financial benefits. In other words, although firms often acknowledge that superior customer value can lead to higher profits, they may be afraid to practise because of a concern that significant costs may reduce profits. It is, therefore, imperative that firms understand the effects of each dimension of customer value and allocate their limited resources accordingly.\\"","completion":"Khi nhiều doanh nghiệp thực hiện CRM, việc đánh giá hiệu suất trở thành một thách thức đáng kể và có xu hướng nghiên cứu nhấn mạnh một khía cạnh của hiệu suất CRM mà bỏ qua các khía cạnh khác, làm cho việc hiểu rõ ý nghĩa thực tế của các đo lường hiệu suất khác nhau trở nên khó khăn đối với các quản lý. Ít có nghiên cứu, nếu có, đã được tiến hành để xem xét các tác động khác biệt của các khía cạnh riêng lẻ của giá trị khách hàng đối với các khía cạnh cụ thể của hiệu suất CRM. Điều này làm cho việc xác định và nhận biết những quá trình và hoạt động tạo và cung cấp giá trị nhất quán nhất cho khía cạnh hiệu suất dự định của CRM để tối đa hóa giá trị khách hàng của doanh nghiệp trở thành gần như không thể thực hiện được cho các quản lý. Trong thực tế, việc nghiên cứu theo phương pháp thực nghiệm về tác động của các khía cạnh quan trọng của giá trị khách hàng là rất quan trọng - vì việc cung cấp giá trị khách hàng vượt trội có thể đòi hỏi chi phí đáng kể cho các công ty. Trong một số trường hợp, có thể lo ngại rằng các chi phí như vậy có thể vượt quá lợi ích tài chính tiềm năng. Nói cách khác, mặc dù các công ty thường thừa nhận rằng việc tạo ra giá trị khách hàng vượt trội có thể dẫn đến lợi nhuận cao hơn, họ có thể lo lắng vì sự bất an rằng các chi phí đáng kể có thể làm giảm lợi nhuận. Do đó, điều rất quan trọng là các công ty hiểu rõ các tác động của từng khía cạnh của giá trị khách hàng và phân bổ tài nguyên hạn chế của mình theo đúng."},{"prompt":"用中文回复我","completion":"好的，请问有什么我可以帮助您的？"},{"prompt":"财税领域的短视频如何在抖音等平台上获得较好的流量","completion":"要在抖音等平台上获得较好的流量，您可以考虑以下几点： 1. 高质量的内容：制作有趣、有用、与财税领域相关的短视频，包括财税知识讲解、实用财务技巧、税收政策解读等。确保内容能吸引目标受众的关注和分享。 2. 短小精悍：抖音等平台的特点是短视频，因此要尽量在15秒至1分钟内传递出信息。保持内容简洁明了，节奏紧凑，以引起用户的兴趣。 3. 利用合适的音乐和特效：抖音等平台非常注重音乐和特效的运用。选择适合内容和节奏的音乐，利用特效、滤镜等提升视频的观赏性。 4. 抓住时下热点：关注财税领域的最新热点事件和话题，及时制作相关的短视频。这样能够吸引更多关注和转发，提高流量。 5. 利用社交媒体渠道推广：在其他社交媒体平台上宣传和分享您的短视频，例如微信、微博等。借助其他平台的流量和用户群体，提升抖音上的曝光量。 6. 与用户互动：积极回应用户的评论和私信，与用户互动，让用户感受到关心和参与。这样能够增加用户粘性和忠诚度，促进短视频的分享和传播。 7. 持续更新和优化：定期发布新的短视频内容，保持更新频率，吸引用户的持续关注。同时，根据用户的反馈和反应，不断改进和优化内容，提升用户体验。 希望以上建议对您有所帮助，祝您在抖音等平台上取得较好的流量和影响力！"},{"prompt":"财税领域的短视频怎样在抖音等平台上获得较好的流量","completion":"要在抖音等平台上获得较好的流量，您可以考虑以下几个策略： 1. 确定目标受众：明确您的目标受众是哪些人群，例如企业主、个体户或普通公众等。了解他们的兴趣、需求和关注点，以便制作符合他们喜好的内容。 2. 制作吸引人的内容：财税领域可能被认为比较干燥，但您可以通过创意和独特的方式制作有趣、富有教育性的短视频。结合幽默、趣味、实用性等多种元素，吸引用户的注意力。 3. 短视频长度：在抖音等平台上，用户喜欢短小精悍的视频。将重点放在15秒至1分钟的视频内容上，确保能够在短时间内传递清晰的信息。 4. 利用抖音平台特色：抖音有丰富的音乐、滤镜和特效可供使用。选择适合内容和表达方式的配乐、特效和滤镜，增加视频的吸引力。 5. 关注热点话题：了解财税领域的热点话题，并将其与短视频内容结合起来。关注当前的税收政策、财务课题或经济形势，制作与之相关的视频，吸引更多用户关注和分享。 6. 发布时间选择：根据抖音平台的用户活跃时间，选择最佳发布时段。通常而言，工作日的晚上和周末是用户活跃度较高的时间段。 7. 与用户互动：积极回复用户评论，与用户建立互动关系。回答他们的问题和疑虑，提供更多的帮助和价值，增加用户的黏性和忠诚度。 8. 利用其他社交媒体平台宣传：将您的抖音短视频分享到其他社交媒体平台，如微信、微博等，扩大视频的曝光度和传播范围。 以上是在抖音等平台上获得较好流量的一些建议，希望对您有所帮助！"},{"prompt":"Hi","completion":"Hello!

Leveraging investments: Taking on strategic debt to invest in high-return assets can increase your potential earnings and help you grow your wealth in the long run. For example, leveraging a mortgage to purchase real estate that appreciates in value can lead to substantial wealth creation. 2. Business financing: Debt can be used to start or expand a business, providing necessary capital for growth and increasing your earning potential. However, careful planning and management are crucial to ensure that the business generates sufficient revenue to repay the debt. 3. Education and training: Taking on student loans or other forms of debt to invest in your education and acquire sought-after skills can enhance your earning potential and lead to higher-paying job opportunities. 4. Cash flow management: In some cases, debt can be used strategically to manage cash flow or take advantage of time-sensitive opportunities. For example, if you have a steady income stream but come across an investment opportunity that requires immediate funding, taking on a short-term debt may be viable. It's important to remember that these strategies come with risks, and success is not guaranteed. It's essential to assess your financial situation, consider potential risks, and develop a comprehensive plan before taking on any debt. Seeking the advice of financial professionals can also be helpful in navigating these decisions."},{"prompt":"How debts are good in financial planning?","completion":"While it is generally advisable to minimize debt, there are instances where debt can be useful in financial planning: 1. Investment Opportunities: Debt can be utilized to leverage investment opportunities that have the potential for high returns. For example, if you have identified an investment with a consistently high rate of return, using debt can amplify your gains and accelerate wealth accumulation. However, caution should be exercised as high-risk investments can also lead to significant losses. 2. Tax Efficiency: Certain debts, such as mortgage interest or loans taken for business purposes, may qualify for tax deductions. By strategically using debt to finance investments or business activities, you may be able to reduce your taxable income and optimize your tax planning. 3. Cash Flow Management: In some cases, taking on debt can help manage cash flow and provide financial flexibility. For example, if you have periodic or irregular income, borrowing money may help cover immediate expenses or bridge income gaps until funds are available. 4. Building Credit History: Responsible and timely debt management can contribute to establishing a positive credit history. This can be essential when applying for loans or mortgages in the future, as a good credit score often leads to more favorable terms and conditions. While there can be advantages to using debt strategically, it is crucial to exercise discipline, borrow within your means, and have a comprehensive plan for debt repayment. Overspending or accumulating excessive debt can lead to financial stress and hinder long-term financial goals. Professional financial advice can help assess your individual circumstances and determine appropriate debt management strategies within your financial plan."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The book explores various principles related to financial success and creating wealth. Here are some of the key principles explained in the book: 1. The Rich Don't Work for Money: Kiyosaki emphasizes the importance of having money work for you, instead of simply working hard for money. He suggests developing a mindset of investing, building assets, and creating passive income streams. 2. Mind Your Own Business: The book stresses the significance of acquiring financial literacy and taking control of your financial situation. It advocates for understanding financial statements, investing, and making informed decisions about money. 3. Use Leverage: Rich people use leverage, such as other people's time, money, and expertise, to enhance their wealth and achieve financial freedom. 4. The Importance of Education: The book challenges the traditional notion that formal education guarantees success. Kiyosaki promotes the idea of continuous learning, especially in areas related to personal finance and investing. 5. Savers Are Losers: The book argues that simply saving money isn't enough to achieve financial independence. Kiyosaki emphasizes the need to invest and take calculated risks to grow wealth. 6. Pay Yourself First: The book encourages readers to prioritize saving and investing by \\"paying themselves first\\" before spending on day-to-day expenses. 7. Assets vs. Liabilities: Kiyosaki distinguishes between assets and liabilities. He defines assets as things that put money in your pocket, while liabilities are things that take money out. The book advises focusing on acquiring income-generating assets instead of accumulating liabilities that drain resources. 8. Build a Team: Kiyosaki emphasizes the importance of surrounding yourself with financially knowledgeable advisors, such as accountants and attorneys, to make informed financial decisions and seek professional guidance. 9. Embrace Failure and Learn from Mistakes: The book encourages readers to be open to failure, as it provides valuable lessons and helps develop resilience. Kiyosaki emphasizes the importance of learning from mistakes and moving forward. 10. Think Big and Take Action: \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\" promotes thinking big and having the courage to take action. Kiyosaki highlights the importance of envisioning financial success and taking steps to bring those visions to life. These principles are meant to challenge conventional thinking about money and provide a framework for building wealth and achieving financial freedom."},{"prompt":"Buy asset not liabilities, explain this financial principal.","completion":"The principle of \\"buying assets instead of liabilities\\" is a key concept discussed in \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad.\\" According to Robert Kiyosaki, assets are possessions or investments that put money in your pocket, while liabilities are things that take money out of your pocket. Here's a further explanation of this financial principle: 1. Assets: Assets are resources that generate income and appreciate in value over time. Examples of assets can include real estate properties, stocks, bonds, businesses, intellectual property, and even educational investments that enhance your skills and earning potential. The key characteristic of an asset is that it generates cash flow or appreciates in value, contributing to your financial growth and independence. - Cash-Generating Assets: These are assets that provide regular income, such as rental properties, dividend-paying stocks, or a business that generates profits. - Appreciating Assets: These are assets that increase in value over time, such as real estate properties or certain stocks that appreciate in value. The idea behind buying assets is to acquire income-producing resources that help you build wealth and achieve financial freedom. 2. Liabilities: Liabilities, on the other hand, are things that drain your finances and create expenses. Common examples of liabilities include mortgages, car loans, credit card debt, personal loans, and anything that requires regular payments without generating income or appreciation. Liabilities add to your financial burden and can hinder your ability to accumulate wealth. The principle emphasizes the importance of being mindful of your spending habits and making conscious choices to acquire assets instead of liabilities. The goal is to focus on investing in assets that generate income and appreciate in value, rather than accumulating liabilities that create financial obligations. By prioritizing asset acquisition and minimizing liabilities, you can increase your wealth, create passive income streams, and ultimately achieve financial independence. This principle requires a shift in mindset and a disciplined approach to financial decision-making."},{"prompt":"How to buy assets which can make me more money?","completion":"To buy assets that have the potential to generate more money, there are several steps you can take: 1. Expand Your Financial Education: Enhance your knowledge about different types of assets, investment strategies, and financial markets. Read books, attend seminars, take courses, and follow reputable financial resources to understand various asset classes and their potential for generating income. 2. Set Financial Goals: Determine your financial goals and objectives. Are you looking for passive income, long-term growth, or a combination of both? Knowing your goals will help you choose the most suitable assets for your investment strategy. 3. Diversify Your Portfolio: Avoid putting all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your investments across different asset classes, such as stocks, real estate, bonds, businesses, or alternative investments like precious metals or cryptocurrencies. This diversification lowers the risk and increases the potential for higher returns. 4. Analyze Potential Returns: Perform thorough research and analysis of potential investments. Consider factors such as historical performance, current market conditions, future growth prospects, cash flow potential, and risk factors associated with each asset. This analysis will help you evaluate the potential income-generating capacity of the asset. 5. Seek Professional Advice: Consult with financial advisors or professionals specialized in the asset class you are interested in. They can provide insights, guidance, and help you make informed decisions based on your financial goals, risk appetite, and investment timeline. 6. Use Leverage Effectively: Leverage, when used appropriately, can amplify your investment returns. For example, using mortgage financing to invest in real estate can allow you to control a property worth more than your initial investment. However, it's crucial to understand the associated risks and ensure you have a solid plan in place to manage debt and interest payments. 7. Monitor and Adjust: Regularly review the performance of your assets and make adjustments as needed. Stay informed about market trends, economic factors, and new investment opportunities. Reassess your asset allocation and make changes as your financial goals and risk tolerance evolve. Remember, investing in assets carries risks, and there are no guarantees of high returns. Conduct thorough research, diversify your investments, and make decisions based on your personal financial situation and risk tolerance. It's essential to develop a long-term perspective and have patience when building a portfolio of income-generating assets."},{"prompt":"what's Youtube Automation?

This gripping drama delves into the heart-wrenching opioid crisis and exposes the controversial role played by the influential Sackler family. Drawing inspiration from the critically acclaimed books \\"The Family That Built an Empire of Pain\\" by Patrick Radden Keefe and \\"Pain Killer: An Empire of Deceit and the Origin of America’s Opioid Epidemic\\" by Barry Meier, the series sheds light on the devastating consequences of corporate greed and deception. Plot and Characters: \\"Painkiller\\" focuses on the intricate web of power, manipulation, and tragedy surrounding the Sackler family. The miniseries presents a multigenerational saga, with Matthew Broderick portraying Richard Sackler, a central figure in the opioid crisis. Broderick's portrayal builds on Michael Stuhlbarg's previous interpretation of the character in Hulu's \\"Dopesick,\\" showcasing different facets of Richard's complex personality. Sam Anderson embodies Richard's father, Raymond Sackler, while John Rothman takes on the role of Mortimer Sackler, Raymond's brother. Together, they navigate the moral implications of their pharmaceutical empire and confront the growing realization that their products have led to widespread addiction and suffering. Uzo Aduba plays the role of Edie, a drug inspector deeply skeptical of the Sackler family's claims about the opioid epidemic. Taylor Kitsch portrays Glen Kryger, Lily's husband, who becomes unexpectedly ensnared in addiction after being prescribed opioids. Carolina Bartczak brings Lily Kryger to life, providing a raw portrayal of the countless individuals affected by this crisis. Supporting roles are equally compelling, with Tyler Ritter as John Brownlee, the lawyer fighting for justice against the Sacklers, and Ana Cruz Kayne as Brianna Ortiz, an ambitious sales recruit torn between loyalty and morality. West Duchvony portrays Shannon Schaeffer, a young woman seeking to break free from her sheltered life, who joins Purdue Pharma's sales team. Jack Mulhern plays Tyler Kryger, Lily's stepson, highlighting the ripple effects of addiction within families. Additional roles include John Ales as Dr. Gregory Fitzgibbons and Dina Shihabi as Britt Hufford, Shannon's mentor and a persuasive Prudue Pharma sales representative.

Created by Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster, known for their work on the acclaimed drama \\"Transparent,\\" the miniseries is poised to captivate audiences and spark important conversations. Given the addictive nature of the opioid crisis, \\"Painkiller\\" provides a crucial opportunity to shed light on the Sackler family's alleged role in perpetuating this national tragedy. With six thought-provoking episodes, the series aims to explore the systemic issues surrounding pharmaceutical companies and their influence on public health. Comparison With \\"Dopesick\\": Inevitably, comparisons with Hulu's \\"Dopesick\\" will arise due to their shared themes and the portrayal of Richard Sackler. However, \\"Painkiller\\" distinguishes itself by delving deeper into the complex Sackler family dynamics and the origins of Purdue Pharma's questionable practices. Conclusion: With the release of \\"Painkiller\\" on Netflix this August, viewers can anticipate a gripping and hard-hitting miniseries that explores the dark side of the opioid crisis. By drawing inspiration from real-life accounts and acclaimed books, the series aims to raise awareness about the corporate greed and deception that have devastated countless lives. As the Sackler family's controversial legacy is brought to light, \\"Painkiller\\" serves as a call to action, urging society to confront the opioid crisis head-on and work towards healing and justice."},{"prompt":"Dragon Tales Logo List of Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese, Dutch, English (original), German, Hebrew v1, Hebrew V2, Hindi, Instrumentals, Korean, Latin Spanish, Polish, and (exclusive version):","completion":"Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I do not have the ability to directly display or provide visual assets such as logos.

Is it one of those “if-you’re-famous-you-can-get-away-with-anything” instances, or are there credible exceptions?

There will, however, be occasions when a scene’s POV character is just an observer to the main action.

For example, the POV character may want nothing more than to make a PB&J sandwich, while his sister wants to get the attention of the cute TV repairman working in the living room. Your POV character here may be just an observer to the greater stakes of love and war. However, his observation and probable input must either immediately or eventually relate back to his story.

For instance, in a scene where the POV character wants to make a PB&J sandwich, while his sister is interested in attracting the attention of a TV repairman, the POV character becomes an observer to the higher stakes of love and romance. However, the observation and input of the POV character should ultimately relate back to his own story, either immediately or eventually.

The Prime Minister of Italy is the head of government and exercises executive power. They are responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations of the government, proposing and implementing policies, and representing Italy both domestically and internationally. The Prime Minister has the authority to appoint and dismiss ministers, chair the Council of Ministers, and shape the legislative agenda. However, the Prime Minister's powers are not unlimited. They must work within the framework of the constitution and need the support of Parliament to pass laws and implement policies. The Italian Parliament consists of two chambers, the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, with whom the Prime Minister must collaborate and negotiate to gain support for their agenda. The Prime Minister is accountable to the Parliament and can be subjected to parliamentary scrutiny. They are required to answer questions from members of Parliament, and their actions can be debated and scrutinized. The Prime Minister can also face a vote of no confidence if a majority of the Parliament withdraws its support. Additionally, the judiciary can hold the Prime Minister accountable if they engage in illegal activities or abuse their power.

The content of news: \\"Inflation showed further signs of cooling in June, according to a gauge released Friday that the Federal Reserve follows closely. The personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy increased just 0.2% from the previous month, in line with the Dow Jones estimate, the Commerce Department said. So-called core PCE rose 4.1% from a year ago, compared with the estimate for 4.2%. The annual rate was the lowest since September 2021 and marked a decrease from the 4.6% pace in May. Headline PCE inflation including food and energy costs also increased 0.2% on the month and rose 3% on an annual basis. The yearly rate was the lowest since March 2021 and moved down from 3.8% in May. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JULY 27: People shop in a Manhattan store on July 27, 2023 in New York City. A report released on Thursday by the government stated a 2.4% annualized growth in the American economy last quarter, offering reassurance against recession. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) People shop in a Manhattan store on July 27, 2023 in New York City. Spencer Platt | Getty Images Goods prices actually decreased 0.1% for the month while services rose 0.3%. Food prices also fell 0.1%, while energy increased 0.6%. Markets reacted positively to the report, with stock market futures pointing higher and Treasury yields headed lower. “Today’s economic releases reaffirm the current market narrative that inflation is cooling and economic growth is continuing, which is a favorable environment for risk assets,” said George Mateyo, chief investment officer at Key Private Bank. “The Fed and investors will take comfort in these numbers as they suggest that the inflation threat is dissipating and thus the Fed may now be able to go on vacation and assume an extended pause with respect to future interest rate increases.” The data reinforces other recent releases showing that, at least compared with the soaring inflation from a year ago, prices have begun to ease. Readings such as the consumer price index are showing a slower rise in inflation, while consumer expectations also are also coming back in line with longer-term trends. Fed officials follow the PCE index closely as it adjusts for changing behavior from consumers and provides a different look at price trends than the more widely cited CPI. Along with the inflation data, the Commerce Department said personal income rose 0.3% while spending increased 0.5%. Income came in slightly below expectations, while spending was in line. The report comes just two days after the Fed announced a quarter percentage point interest rate increase, its 11th hike since March 2022 and the first since skipping the June meeting. That took the central bank’s key borrowing rate to a target range of 5.25%-5.5%, its highest level in more than 22 years. Following the hike, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell stressed that future decisions on rate moves would be based on incoming data rather than a preset course on policy. Central bank officials generally believe that inflation is still too high despite the recent positive trends and want to see multiple months of solid data before changing direction. A separate indicator that the Fed follows closely showed that compensation costs increased a seasonally adjusted 1% on an annual basis during the second quarter. That reading for the employment cost index was slightly below the 1.1% estimate.\\"","completion":"Headline: US Inflation Shows Signs of Cooling in June Details of News: According to the gauge closely followed by the Federal Reserve, inflation in the US continued to moderate in June.

The content of news: “Japan’s central bank on Friday loosened its yield curve control, underscoring concerns about its protracted monetary easing on financial markets and the real economy. In a policy statement, the Bank of Japan said it will continue to allow 10-year Japanese government bond yields to fluctuate in the range of around plus and minus 0.5 percentage points from its 0% target level — though it will offer to purchase 10-year JGBs at 1% through fixed-rate operations. This move effectively expands its tolerance by a further 50 basis points. The BOJ pledged to “conduct yield curve control with greater flexibility, regarding the upper and lower bounds of the range as references, not as rigid limits, in its market operations,” citing the need to remain nimble given “extremely high uncertainties for Japan’s economic activity and prices.” In what was BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda’s first major policy change since he took the helm in April, the central bank also kept its ultra-loose interest rate intact, electing to hold its short-term interest rate target at -0.1% after its July policy meeting. It also raised its median forecast for inflation to 2.5% for fiscal 2023, up from its 1.8% prediction in April. “This is not intended as a step toward policy normalization. Rather, it’s a step aimed at enhancing the sustainability of YCC,” Ueda said at a press conference in Tokyo on Friday afternoon explaining the central bank’s decision, according to a translation provided by Reuters. “Responding after upward risks materialize would put us behind the curve, and make the side-effects very large. The risk of us being forced to abandon YCC against our will is not zero. That’s why we need to act pre-emptively,” he added. hide content Japan 10 Year Treasury RT Quote | Exchange 0.60% quote price arrow up+0.044 Yield | 11:00 AM JST Market reaction Years of accommodative monetary policy in Japan — even as other global central banks have tightened policy in the last 12 months — have concentrated carry trades in the Japanese yen. Carry trades involve borrowing at a lower interest rate to invest in other assets that promise higher returns. Yields for the 10-year JGB touched their highest since September 2014 as the BOJ announcement triggered a sell-off, while the yen whipsawed against the dollar. The benchmark Nikkei and Topix stock indexes — standout outperformers in the Asia Pacific in the last 12 months — deepened losses after the announcement, but recovered before the close. Japanese bank shares rallied in Tokyo, with Mitsubishi UFJ surging 5.3% to its highest in more than 4½ years. U.S. Treasury yields spiked after an earlier Nikkei report suggested the BOJ will allow “long-term interest rates to rise beyond its cap of 0.5% by a certain degree.” “In practical terms, this ‘flexibility’ language is similar to that used in late 2022, when the 10yr JGB target range was increased from +/-25bp to +/-50bp,” said Stephen Halmarick, Commonwealth Bank of Australia’s chief economist in a note. “The ‘flexibility’ does represent, therefore, some tightening in monetary policy.” hide content USD/JPY RT Quote | Exchange 141.50 quote price arrow up+0.35 (+0.25%) Last | 10:20 PM EDT WATCHLIST + QUOTE DETAILS Still doves, not hawks Ueda, however, pushed back on such suggestions, saying Friday’s announcement represents a modification of the central bank’s current dovish position. “The bond market is pretty stable now and we saw uncertainty over the outlook very high. This was a good timing to make tweaks to our policy framework,” Ueda said at the same press conference. “If inflation expectations heighten and we try to control bond yields with our market operation, real interest rates will fall. That would stimulate the economy and prop up inflation. We’ve seen such effects appear on the economy in the past year or so,” he added. “On the other hand, that also means the side-effects are increasing. We looked at the balance of both factors, and decided to make YCC flexible,” Ueda said. With the spike in commodity prices last year, the BOJ was forced to defend its yield limit with more bond purchases. This led to accusations the central bank was distorting the pricing mechanism in the market, which led to yen weakness that in turn inflated the cost of raw materials imports even further. Consequently, the BOJ has been under pressure to tighten its monetary policy. Inflation has consistently exceeding its 2% target for 15 straight months, while wages are finally starting to increase after years of stagnation. “Sustainable and stable achievement of the price stability target of 2%, accompanied by wage increases, has not yet come in sight, and thus the Bank needs to patiently continue with monetary easing under Quantitative and Qualitative monetary easing with yield curve control,” the BOJ said Friday. Economists have been watching for more changes to the BOJ’s yield curve control policy, part of the Japanese central bank’s efforts to reflate growth in the world’s third-largest economy and sustainably achieve its 2% inflation target after years of deflation. The BOJ, however, disagrees. “Letting yields move completely freely would essentially be abandoning YCC, and we’re not ready for that,” Ueda said. “We’d like to adjust the speed of yield moves and prevent speculative bond trading from spreading.””","completion":"Headline: Bank of Japan loosens yield curve control policy, expands tolerance range Detail: The Bank of Japan announced that it will allow 10-year Japanese government bond yields to fluctuate within a range of around plus and minus 0.5 percentage points from its 0% target level.

Assuming an average height of 10 feet per story, the total volume of the building would be 9000 cubic feet. Let's assume each floor requires a height of 1 foot for structural elements, leaving 9 feet for actual usable space per story. If we divide the total volume of the building by the volume of each story, we get a rough estimate of the maximum number of stories that could be built: 9000 cubic feet / (9 cubic feet per story) = 1000 stories Again, this calculation assumes ideal conditions and ignores practical limitations such as the need for infrastructure, utilities, and occupancy requirements.

Its effectiveness in promoting conflict resolution was influenced by several factors, including power dynamics, external influences, and individual leadership qualities. Below are further elaborations on these factors: 1. Power Dynamics: The power dynamics between the parties involved in the conflict played a crucial role in influencing the effectiveness of conflict resolution tactics. The agreement aimed to address the power imbalance between the two main communities in Northern Ireland, the nationalists (predominantly Catholic) and unionists (predominantly Protestant). The agreement recognized the aspiration for Irish reunification while also acknowledging the desire to maintain the link between Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom. By addressing power-sharing and parallel consent structures, the agreement attempted to create a more balanced and inclusive political system that could accommodate both communities. 2. External Influences: Several external influences significantly influenced the effectiveness of conflict resolution tactics in the Good Friday Agreement. The involvement of the British and Irish governments as mediators provided a framework for negotiations and helped manage the power dynamics between the parties. The international context, particularly the end of the Cold War and the dynamics of the European Union, provided incentives for conflict resolution. The EU, in particular, played a role by offering economic aid and a platform for building cross-border cooperation between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. 3. Individual Leadership Qualities: The presence of individuals with strong leadership qualities and commitment to conflict resolution was crucial in the effectiveness of the tactics employed. Key figures like Tony Blair, as the British Prime Minister, and Bertie Ahern, as the Irish Taoiseach (Prime Minister), played pivotal roles by providing focused leadership and sustained commitment to the peace process. The ability of leaders to inspire trust, build bridges between communities, and navigate through challenging political landscapes significantly influenced the success of the negotiation process. 4. Consensus Building: The effectiveness of conflict resolution tactics in the Good Friday Agreement was also influenced by the emphasis on consensus-building. The agreement employed a multi-party negotiation process, involving representatives from various political parties, community organizations, and paramilitary groups. Through inclusive dialogue and accommodating diverse perspectives, the agreement aimed to create a broad-based consensus that would endure. The inclusion of various stakeholders and the commitment to compromise were important contributors to its overall efficacy. 5. Legislative Measures and Institutions: The establishment of new legislative measures and institutions created by the agreement had a direct impact on conflict resolution. The Northern Ireland Assembly, the cross-community power-sharing government, and the North/South Ministerial Council formed essential components of the agreement. By putting in place these democratic structures, the agreement provided channels for political participation, shared decision-making, and cooperation between communities. Overall, the effectiveness of conflict resolution tactics in the Good Friday Agreement was influenced by power dynamics, external influences, and the presence of strong leadership committed to consensus-building. These factors came together to create a framework that addressed historical divisions, provided mechanisms for inclusive governance, and facilitated the resolution of the Northern Ireland conflict."},{"prompt":"Analyze the Impacts, Lessons Learned and future for the good friday agreement","completion":"The Good Friday Agreement, also known as the Belfast Agreement, has had significant impacts on Northern Ireland, providing valuable lessons and shaping the future of the region.

Ensuring that the peace process is not undermined by future arrangements remains a key challenge. b. Reconciliation and Healing: The Good Friday Agreement laid the foundation for reconciliation, but further work is needed to heal the deep-rooted divisions within Northern Irish society. Addressing issues such as segregation, legacy of the Troubles, and shared spaces will be vital in strengthening the peace process. c.

Educational initiatives, intercommunity programs, and youth representation can help shape a positive future. d. Political Stability: Ensuring ongoing stability, effective power-sharing, and avoidance of political deadlock are critical for maintaining progress. Continued commitment from political leaders, strengthened institutions, and constructive dialogue will be necessary. In conclusion, the Good Friday Agreement has had remarkable impacts in bringing peace and stability to Northern Ireland. Lessons learned from its success emphasize inclusivity, power-sharing, and addressing diverse identities. However, challenges such as Brexit and reconciliation efforts remain. The future of the agreement depends on navigating these challenges, engaging younger generations, and maintaining political stability to secure a prosperous and shared future for Northern Ireland."},{"prompt":"Discuss outcomes of the good friday agreement","completion":"The Good Friday Agreement, signed on April 10, 1998, and formally known as the Belfast Agreement, has had several significant outcomes that have shaped the political, social, and economic landscape of Northern Ireland. Some of the key outcomes of the agreement include: 1. End of Sectarian Violence: One of the primary and most crucial outcomes of the Good Friday Agreement was the end of widespread sectarian violence and the Troubles. The agreement allowed paramilitary groups to decommission their weapons, leading to a drastic reduction in violence and ensuring a more peaceful environment in Northern Ireland. 2. Power-Sharing: The agreement established a power-sharing government in Northern Ireland, known as the Northern Ireland Assembly, and a cross-community executive that involved representatives from both nationalist and unionist communities. This power-sharing model provided a platform for shared decision-making, cooperation, and representation of all major political parties in the region. 3. Human Rights Protections: The incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into Northern Ireland law was a significant outcome of the agreement. This ensured stronger human rights protections for all citizens in Northern Ireland and helped address historical grievances. 4. Cross-Border Cooperation: The Good Friday Agreement emphasized the importance of cross-border cooperation between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Institutions like the North/South Ministerial Council were established to facilitate cooperation in areas such as trade, agriculture, tourism, and transportation. This collaboration has helped foster better relations and strengthened ties between the two parts of the island. 5. Socio-Economic Development: The peace dividend resulting from the Good Friday Agreement brought economic benefits to Northern Ireland. Increased stability and a positive business environment attracted investment and led to improved socio-economic conditions for the region. This includes the growth of industries such as tourism, infrastructure development, and increased employment opportunities. 6. Reconciliation Efforts: The agreement aimed to promote reconciliation and healing within Northern Irish society. This involved addressing the legacy of the Troubles, establishing mechanisms to investigate past events, supporting victims and survivors, and fostering dialogue between communities. While the process of reconciliation remains ongoing, the agreement set the foundation for initiatives focused on understanding, empathy, and building a shared future. 7. International Recognition: The Good Friday Agreement received international acclaim and recognition for its successful conflict resolution efforts. The agreement has served as a model for peace processes in other parts of the world and continues to be studied by scholars and peace practitioners. Despite these outcomes, it is important to note that the Good Friday Agreement is not without its challenges and areas that require ongoing attention. Issues like segregated communities, economic disparities, unresolved issues from the past, and the impact of Brexit on Northern Ireland present ongoing challenges that need to be addressed to ensure the long-term success and sustainability of the agreement. However, the Good Friday Agreement remains a significant milestone in Northern Ireland's history, laying the foundation for peace, stability, and a pathway towards a better future for all communities in the region."},{"prompt":"discuss the establishment of democratic institutions resulting from the good friday agreement","completion":"The Good Friday Agreement played a vital role in establishing democratic institutions in Northern Ireland, aiming to create a more inclusive and representative political system. These institutions were designed to accommodate the diverse interests and aspirations of both nationalist and unionist communities. Here, we will discuss the key democratic institutions that emerged as a result of the agreement: 1. Northern Ireland Assembly: The Good Friday Agreement led to the creation of the Northern Ireland Assembly, a devolved legislature with legislative and executive powers. This institution provides a platform for political parties to represent their constituents and engage in democratic decision-making. The assembly consists of elected members from political parties across the spectrum, and it is responsible for a wide range of devolved policy areas, including education, health, and justice. The assembly operates on a power-sharing basis, ensuring the inclusion of both nationalist and unionist parties. 2. Executive Office: Building upon the power-sharing principle, the Good Friday Agreement established the Executive Office, which serves as the executive branch of the Northern Ireland government. It consists of a First Minister and Deputy First Minister representing the largest nationalist and unionist parties respectively. The Executive Office is responsible for collectively making decisions on matters of governance and policy, promoting cooperation between political parties, and ensuring power-sharing between communities. 3. North/South Ministerial Council: The North/South Ministerial Council is an important institution created by the Good Friday Agreement to foster cross-border cooperation between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. This institution facilitates regular meetings between the Northern Ireland Executive and the Irish government, allowing for joint decision-making on matters of mutual interest. It helps coordinate policies in areas such as agriculture, transport, health, tourism, and education, promoting closer cooperation and integration between the two parts of the island. 4. Good Friday Agreement Institutions: The Good Friday Agreement also established several institutions and bodies to support and oversee the implementation of the agreement's provisions. These include the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains, the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning, and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission. These institutions play critical roles in addressing issues related to the legacy of the Troubles, advancing demilitarization, and protecting human rights. These democratic institutions have significantly contributed to the stability and functioning of the political system in Northern Ireland. By providing mechanisms for representation, cooperation, and shared decision-making, they have helped ensure inclusive governance while acknowledging the distinct identities and aspirations within the region. However, ongoing commitment, cooperation, and constructive dialogue among political leaders are necessary to maintain and strengthen these democratic institutions and sustain the peace process in Northern Ireland."},{"prompt":"--Please find attached RG Barry design fee of July 2023.

pinning支持POST请求。SSL pinning是一种安全机制，用于保护应用程序免受中间人攻击。它通过将服务器的公钥固定在客户端上，确保客户端只与预期的服务器进行通信。 无论是发送GET请求还是POST请求，SSL pinning都可以用于验证服务器的身份。客户端会检查服务器的公钥是否与预定义的公钥匹配，如果匹配则可以继续请求，否则会抛出安全错误。 SSL pinning可以用于任何类型的请求，包括GET、POST、PUT、DELETE等。无论是在身份验证请求还是数据传输过程中，SSL pinning都可以提供额外的安全性保证。"},{"prompt":"post会报错Trust anchor for certification path not found.，get不会，是什么问题？","completion":"如果在使用SSL pinning时，在发送POST请求时遇到\\"Trust anchor for certification path not found\\"错误，而GET请求没有出现该错误，可能有以下几个原因： 1. 证书链不完整：在SSL pinning中，客户端需要通过证书链来验证服务器的身份。如果服务器的证书链不完整或不正确，就会导致验证失败。请确保服务器的证书链是完整的，并按照正确的顺序部署。 2. 证书过期或无效：如果服务器的证书过期或无效，SSL pinning会检测到并抛出验证错误。请确保服务器的证书是有效且没有过期的。 3. 客户端没有正确配置服务器的公钥：SSL pinning需要在客户端上配置服务器的公钥，以便进行验证。如果客户端没有正确配置或配置了错误的公钥，就会导致验证失败。请检查客户端代码中SSL pinning的配置，确保正确配置了服务器的公钥。 4. 客户端没有正确处理SSL证书验证：有些情况下，客户端可能没有正确处理SSL证书验证过程中的异常。这可能导致当服务器的证书不受信任时，GET请求可以继续执行，而POST请求会抛出异常。建议在代码中正确处理SSL证书验证的异常，以便及时发现和处理证书验证错误。 请检查上述情况并逐一排除，以解决\\"Trust anchor for certification path not

The content of news: \\" BEIJING — China’s housing ministry has announced plans to make it easier for people to buy property. The news, out late Thursday, indicates how different levels of government are starting to act just days after Beijing signaled a shift away from its crackdown on real estate speculation. The planned measures include easing purchase restrictions for people wanting to buy a second house, and reducing down payment ratios for first-time homebuyers, according to an article on the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development’s website. In an effort to reduce speculation in its massive property market, China has made it much harder for people to buy a second house. Mortgage rates for the second purchase can be a full percentage point higher than for the first, while the second-home down payment ratio can skyrocket to 70% or 80% in large cities, according to Natixis. China's recent Politburo meeting had a more constructive outcome China’s recent Politburo outcome was more constructive than market expected: GS The housing ministry article referred to comments from its minister Ni Hong at a recent meeting with eight state-owned and non-state-owned companies in construction and real estate. Since it was a meeting at the central government ministry level, it did not discuss policies for individual cities, said Bruce Pang, chief economist and head of research for Greater China at JLL. But he expects Beijing will encourage local governments to announce real estate policy changes that fit their specific situation. Pang also pointed out that including construction companies at the meeting emphasized their role in promoting investment and stabilizing growth. Waiting on details China has not yet announced formal measures for supporting real estate. However, top level leaders on Monday signaled a greater focus on housing demand, rather than supply. On Tuesday, China’s State Taxation Administration announced “guidelines” for waiving or reducing housing-related taxes. It was not immediately clear what implementation would look like for home buyers. We continue to expect the property sector rally to continue and advise investors to focus on beta names within the property sector. Jizhou Dong The readout of Monday’s Politburo meeting also removed the phrase “houses are for living in, not speculation,” which has been a mantra for Beijing’s tight stance and efforts to rein in developers’ high reliance on debt for growth. “It seems to us that [the housing ministry] is quick in response this time and also gets bolder on relaxing property policies,” Jizhou Dong, China property research analyst at Nomura, said in a note Friday. Given such speed, Dong expects markets are anticipating specific policy implementation in cities such as Shanghai or Guangzhou.

Terrifying things. The trouble this child causes is worse than what children do at his age, and the terrifying events that follow in his presence is nothing short of demonic. Even at times the child would often look... uncanny, less than human.","completion":"This little boy, whom we shall call Daniel, appeared to be an innocent and delicate child at first glance. However, those who spent time with him soon discovered the sinister nature that lurked within. His parents, blinded by their love for him, failed to see the darkness that emanated from his very being. People who crossed paths with Daniel often experienced unfortunate incidents of varying degrees. Accidents would happen inexplicably, and misfortune seemed to follow them like a haunting shadow. It was as if an invisible force fed off the child's presence, manifesting itself in terrifying ways. One incident occurred when Daniel visited his grandparents' house. As soon as he stepped foot inside, the atmosphere grew heavy, and an eerie silence filled the air. Pictures fell off the walls, shattering into pieces, as if pushed by an unseen hand. Objects moved by themselves, and even the family cat hissed and clawed at the air, clearly disturbed by some malevolent force. Another time, Daniel's parents took him to a local park to play with other children. As soon as he joined the group, his presence seemed to darken the skies. The once cheerful playground turned into a stage for nightmares. Swings swung violently on their own, merry-go-rounds spun at alarming speeds, and the once joyous laughter of children turned into terrified screams. Adults present that day could feel an oppressive energy suffocating them, as if something sinister had taken hold of the innocent space. In addition to the horrific events that followed him, there were moments when Daniel himself appeared less than human. His eyes would sometimes glint with a cold, malevolent light, and a sinister smile would crack across his face. People who caught a glimpse of this expression would shudder with an indescribable fear, sensing that they were in the presence of something beyond mortal understanding. Whispers began to circulate within the community, rumors of this child's unholy origins. Some believed he was cursed, a vessel for dark forces that sought to spread chaos and pain. Others suggested he was possessed, a conduit for malevolent spirits that reveled in tormenting those around him. Daniel, oblivious to the terrifying events he unknowingly orchestrated, continued to live his life as any child would. In his innocence, he did not comprehend the fear and destruction he left in his wake. Ignorant of the darkness that tainted his very existence, he charmed his parents with his innocent smile and brought destruction to all who dared to come near. And so, the story of Daniel, the seemingly innocent child cursed with a touch of demonic influence, continued to unfold, leaving a trail of terror and anguish in its wake. Whether salvation and redemption lay within his path remains unknown, a question that only time and the unfolding of his eerie presence can answer."},{"prompt":"Daniel's innocence would soon diminish in just months as his unholy influence grew, oftentimes finding ways to cause terrifying events at home, school or anywhere else while maintaining a net of safety, not out of any hidden benevolence. At a grocery store, Daniel thought to make an employee's life a little worse that day. Nothing. Not a single reaction. Call it luck that Daniel's parents were preoccupied with shopping. Daniel thought to taunt the part-time worker before he grabbed Daniel's arm to prevent him from causing any trouble. \\"Listen kid,\\" the employee says, continuing with \\"I know what you are. What you TRULY are. I suggest you return to your parents before you witness just how out of your league you are to me.\\" The worker had an otherworldly look to him, a horrifying feel to him. Daniel felt true fear for the first time as he ran away back to his parents.","completion":"As Daniel ran back to his parents, his heart raced with a newfound fear that gripped him tightly. The words of the employee echoed in his mind, and his innocent facade began to crack under the weight of his sinister nature. For the first time, he realized that there were forces in the world that could see through his unholy influence, and he was not as invulnerable as he had believed. Returning to his parents, Daniel desperately clung to their presence, seeking solace in their love and protection. But even in their comforting embrace, he could not shake off the creeping sense of dread that had settled within him. He wondered who the employee was, how he knew what Daniel truly was, and what it meant for his dark influence to be challenged. Days turned into weeks, and Daniel's behavior began to change. The mischievous glint in his eyes was replaced with a haunted look, and the once playful smile transformed into a mask of uncertainty. His parents noticed the shift in their child's demeanor, but they remained oblivious to the true nature of the darkness that surrounded him. At school, Daniel's influence began to wane, as if the encounter with the employee had weakened his unholy power. The once terrifying events that followed him became less frequent, and the people around him started to experience a semblance of normalcy. However, this newfound respite only fueled Daniel's curiosity and desire to understand his own existence. Driven by an unyielding need for answers, Daniel began delving into forbidden knowledge, seeking out ancient texts and occult practices that could shed light on his true identity. As he unraveled the secrets buried within the depths of his being, he discovered that he was not merely a vessel for darkness, but a conduit for something far more ancient and malevolent. Haunted by this revelation, Daniel found himself torn between the innocence he once possessed and the monstrous entity that threatened to consume him. The veil between his human side and the demonic force within him grew thinner, and he struggled to maintain control over the darkness that now defined his existence. In the depths of his despair, Daniel realized that his journey was far from over. The encounter with the employee had been a warning, a reminder of the power that existed beyond his own, and the consequences that awaited him if he continued down this path of darkness. With a heavy heart, he knew that he had to confront his true nature, face the horrors within, and find a way to either tame or rid himself of the demonic influence that plagued him. And so, Daniel's story continued to unfold, a battle between innocence and malevolence, as he grappled with the weight of his unholy existence. Whether he would succumb to the darkness or find a way to reclaim his humanity remained uncertain, a fate that only the unfolding of his terrifying journey could reveal."},{"prompt":"Daniel grew into a teenager, and while he tried and succeeded to be more human-like in social and emotional qualities,in secret he was knee-deep in research on who or what he was.

On the surface, he worked tirelessly to appear more human-like, honing his social and emotional skills to blend in with his peers. He desperately sought acceptance and connection, longing to experience the joys and complexities of being a normal teenager. However, behind closed doors, Daniel delved deeper into his research, consumed by the need to understand his true nature. He pored over ancient texts, deciphered cryptic symbols, and sought out forbidden knowledge that could shed light on the origins of his demonic power and presence. The more he discovered, the more he realized the magnitude of the darkness that resided within him. He learned of ancient rituals and dark forces that had shaped his existence since birth. The knowledge he acquired both fascinated and terrified him, as he grappled with the implications of being bound to a demonic entity. As he delved further into his research, Daniel began to experiment with his demonic abilities in secret. He discovered that he possessed a range of supernatural powers, capable of manipulating and influencing the world around him. He could bend the wills of others, summon dark energies, and even manifest physical forms of terror and destruction. Yet, with each use of his powers, Daniel felt a piece of his humanity slipping away. The more he gave in to his demonic side, the harder it became to maintain his human facade. He struggled with a constant internal battle, torn between his desire to understand his true nature and his yearning to reclaim his lost humanity. Throughout his exploration, Daniel encountered others who were connected to the supernatural world. Some sought to exploit his powers, while others offered guidance and support, understanding the struggle he faced. These encounters challenged his notions of good and evil, forcing him to question whether there was a path that could reconcile his demonic heritage with his longing for redemption. As Daniel continued his journey of self-discovery, he realized that his fate was not predetermined solely by his demonic origins. He understood that he had the power to choose his own path, to define who he would become. With this newfound awareness, he sought to find a balance between the darkness that dwelled within him and the light he still yearned to embrace. The story of Daniel, the teenager bound to a demonic power, became one of self-acceptance, redemption, and the eternal struggle between good and evil.

Daniel made sure that even if his refuge of research was found, no one would enter. Though in fairness, he never did believe to deeply in these supernatural topics, nor did he actually test it out. \\"Maybe I might provide something for you, maybe something else.\\" the grocery store employee said to Daniel as he began to grow bat wing behind his back and horns on his head. Daniel was terrified once more, but his terror was now mixed with confusion as the man now had an extra pair of wings, white feathered wings, and a halo behind him. He was infernal, demonic, unholy, yet also angelic, celestial and holy, like some amalgamation of forces that shouldn't have been made.","completion":"Daniel's heart raced as he stared at the transformed grocery store employee, caught between terror and bewilderment. The sight before him defied all logic and understanding, as the man now embodied both infernal and celestial aspects, an amalgamation of opposing forces that should never have coexisted. As fear gripped him, Daniel's mind raced, trying to make sense of the situation. How could this man possess such contradictory powers? And why did he seem so invested in Daniel's journey of self-discovery? The transformed figure, now a paradox of both darkness and light, spoke again, his voice carrying a peculiar blend of authority and compassion. \\"You have delved deep into the realms of the supernatural, seeking answers to the questions that haunt your existence. I have watched you, Daniel, and I see the struggle within you. The battle between good and evil, chaos and redemption.\\" Daniel's voice trembled as he responded, \\"Who... What are you? How can you be both angelic and demonic?\\" The figure smiled, his expression embodying a strange mix of serenity and sorrow. \\"I am an embodiment of duality, a manifestation of the eternal struggle that rages within us all. I am here to guide you, to offer you a choice. Will you embrace the darkness that lies within you, or will you seek the path of redemption and strive for a balance between your infernal and celestial nature?\\" Daniel's mind reeled with the weight of this revelation. He had always believed his demonic influence to be solely a curse, something to be feared and suppressed. But now, faced with this paradoxical being, he realized that perhaps there was a way to harness his powers for good, to find harmony amidst the chaos. Torn between his primal instincts and a newfound glimmer of hope, Daniel contemplated his options. He knew that the path of darkness would lead to nothing but destruction and despair, not only for himself but for those around him. And yet, the allure of power and the temptation to embrace his demonic heritage remained ever-present. With a trembling voice, Daniel finally spoke, his determination laced with uncertainty. \\"I... I choose balance. I want to find a way to use my powers for good, to overcome the darkness within me.\\" The paradoxical figure nodded, his wings folding behind him as he returned to a more human appearance. \\"Very well, Daniel. The path you have chosen is not an easy one, but it is one that holds the potential for redemption and growth. Embrace the light within you, and strive to find harmony with the darkness. Seek knowledge, seek understanding, and never lose sight of your humanity.\\" As the figure faded into the shadows, Daniel was left standing alone, his mind reeling with newfound purpose and determination. He understood that his journey was far from over, and that the path ahead would be filled with challenges and temptations. But he was now armed with a choice, a choice to transcend his demonic origins and forge his own destiny. And so, Daniel's story continued, a tale of a young man torn between the forces of light and darkness, seeking to find his place in a world that often feared and misunderstood him. Whether he would succeed in his quest for balance and redemption remained uncertain, but his resolve burned brightly, guiding him towards a future where he could finally find solace and peace."},{"prompt":"summaries of two equities: \\"26/7: Coca-Cola (KO US, Buy, Target Price USD74, Upside: +17%) (*Awaiting research analyst earnings update) 2Q organic sales (+11% yoy) and EPS (+8% yoy) beat, vs. consensus +8.4% and +7.4% respectively Beat was driven by 10% growth price/mix and 1% and 1% growth in concentrate sales Raised FY organic sales guidance to +8-9% (from 7-8%) vs. consensus of +8.4% Higher net price realization in Ems where it continues to maintain positive volumes \\" and \\"14/7: PepsiCo (PEP US, Buy, Target Price USD225, Upside: +19%) 2Q organic revenue (+13% yoy) and EPS (+12% yoy) beat, vs consensus +9.8% and +5.3% respectively Beat was also driven by robust pricing growth, at +15% y/y in 2Q, vs +16% in 1Q CFRA updated outlook (TP from USD220 to USD225) on 2Q beat, citing faster growing international markets and the Frito-Lay business as the primary growth drivers 10% increase in its annualized dividend starting June, the 51st straight year to hike dividend\\"","completion":"Coca-Cola: Coca-Cola reported strong second-quarter results, with organic sales and earnings per share beating expectations.

The sentiment index climbed to 71.6 from 64.4 last month, according to the final July reading from the University of Michigan. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 72.6, in line with the group’s print earlier in the month. Consumers expect prices will climb at an annual rate of 3.4% over the next year, up slightly from the 3.3% expected in June, data Friday showed. They still see costs rising 3% over the next five to 10 years. Americans are growing more optimistic about the economy as wage gains are finally outpacing inflation and unemployment remains low. Separate data out Friday showed key metrics of US inflation are easing, adding to growing optimism the economy can avoid a recession. The share of consumers blaming high prices for eroding their living standards fell to 36%, the lowest reading in a year and a half, according to the report. However, this measure for lower-income consumers rose in the month. “This re-emerging divergence between high- and low-income consumers, if sustained, restores the typical pattern in which higher-income consumers have more favorable sentiment,” Joanne Hsu, director of the survey, said in a statement. “The months ahead will reveal if the recovery in sentiment will be shared across the income distribution.” The final July reading was somewhat weaker than the one earlier in the month. Since then, gas prices have risen significantly due to a combination of unexpected refinery outages and lower-than-normal stockpiles in key storage hubs, which may risk reigniting inflation. The current conditions gauge climbed to 76.6 from 69 in June, while a measure of expectations also advanced, the university said.

The news, out late Thursday, indicates how different levels of government are starting to act just days after Beijing signaled a shift away from its crackdown on real estate speculation. The planned measures include easing purchase restrictions for people wanting to buy a second house, and reducing down payment ratios for first-time homebuyers, according to an article on the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development’s website. In an effort to reduce speculation in its massive property market, China has made it much harder for people to buy a second house. Mortgage rates for the second purchase can be a full percentage point higher than for the first, while the second-home down payment ratio can skyrocket to 70% or 80% in large cities, according to Natixis. China's recent Politburo meeting had a more constructive outcome China’s recent Politburo outcome was more constructive than market expected: GS The housing ministry article referred to comments from its minister Ni Hong at a recent meeting with eight state-owned and non-state-owned companies in construction and real estate. Since it was a meeting at the central government ministry level, it did not discuss policies for individual cities, said Bruce Pang, chief economist and head of research for Greater China at JLL. But he expects Beijing will encourage local governments to announce real estate policy changes that fit their specific situation. Pang also pointed out that including construction companies at the meeting emphasized their role in promoting investment and stabilizing growth. Waiting on details China has not yet announced formal measures for supporting real estate. However, top level leaders on Monday signaled a greater focus on housing demand, rather than supply. On Tuesday, China’s State Taxation Administration announced “guidelines” for waiving or reducing housing-related taxes. It was not immediately clear what implementation would look like for home buyers. We continue to expect the property sector rally to continue and advise investors to focus on beta names within the property sector. Jizhou Dong NOMURA The readout of Monday’s Politburo meeting also removed the phrase “houses are for living in, not speculation,” which has been a mantra for Beijing’s tight stance and efforts to rein in developers’ high reliance on debt for growth. “It seems to us that [the housing ministry] is quick in response this time and also gets bolder on relaxing property policies,” Jizhou Dong, China property research analyst at Nomura, said in a note Friday. Given such speed, Dong expects markets are anticipating specific policy implementation in cities such as Shanghai or Guangzhou.

Here are a few suggestions for improvement: 1. Remove the \\"Summary Profile\\" section: The information provided in the summary is already covered in the \\"Highlights of Qualifications\\" section. It is redundant and unnecessary. 2. Add specific accomplishments and quantifiable results: In the \\"Professional Experience\\" section, it would be helpful to include specific achievements or outcomes from your tutoring experience. For example, you mention that you have helped students achieve a score of five or above on the LPI exam. Providing quantitative results like this helps to demonstrate your effectiveness as a tutor. 3. Provide more details on your roles and responsibilities: Take the opportunity to provide more specific details about your responsibilities and accomplishments in each role. This will give the reader a better understanding of your skills and expertise. 4. Order the \\"Professional Experience\\" section chronologically: Currently, the work experience section is listed in reverse chronological order. It would be more logical to list it in chronological order, starting with the most recent position and working backwards. 5. Include relevant coursework: Since your Bachelor's degree is in Psychology, it would be beneficial to include any relevant coursework or research projects that you completed during your studies. This will help to strengthen your qualifications for tutoring in subjects like English, Math, and Science. 6. Adjust formatting for consistency: Check for consistent use of capitalization and punctuation throughout the resume. For example, make sure job titles and headings are consistently capitalized, and bullet points are consistently punctuated. 7. Proofread for any grammatical or spelling errors: Double-check for any typos, grammatical mistakes, or spelling errors. These can reflect poorly on your attention to detail and professionalism. Overall, with these improvements, the resume will be even more effective in showcasing your skills, experience, and qualifications as a tutor.

It focuses on managing and improving the quality of inputs, processes, and outputs of a company. 1. Input Dimension: This refers to the materials, resources, and information that are used to produce goods or deliver services. A QMS emphasizes the importance of selecting and controlling the quality of inputs to ensure that only the highest standard materials, components, or information are used in the production process. This includes aspects such as supplier evaluation, raw material testing, and quality assurance throughout the supply chain. 2. Process Dimension: This dimension addresses the various activities, methods, and procedures employed by an organization to transform inputs into finished products or services. A QMS emphasizes the need for standardized and well-documented processes to ensure consistency, efficiency, and effectiveness. It includes activities like process mapping, work instructions, training programs, and continuous improvement initiatives to optimize the processes and reduce errors or defects. 3. Output Dimension: This dimension assesses the final products or services delivered to customers. A QMS focuses on meeting customer requirements, specifications, and expectations through robust quality control measures.
