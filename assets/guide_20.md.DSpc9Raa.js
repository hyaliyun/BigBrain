Let's use the following matrix as an example: \`\`\` | 1 2 3 | | 4 5 6 | | 7 8 9 | \`\`\` Next, we choose a single row or column. Let's choose the first column: \`\`\` | 1 2 3 | | 4 5 6 | | 7 8 9 | \`\`\` We then cross out the row and column of the first element, which in this case is the element in the first row and first column (1). This gives us the following 2 x 2 matrix: \`\`\` | 5 6 | | 8 9 | \`\`\` We then find the determinant of this 2 x 2 matrix using the formula \`ad - bc\`. In this case, the determinant is (5*9) - (6*8) = -3. Next, we multiply the answer by our chosen element, which is 1. This gives us -3*1 = -3. We then need to determine the sign of our answer. In this case, our chosen element (1) is in the first column, which means that the sign of our answer is positive. We repeat this process for the second and third elements in our reference column. The second element is 4, which gives us a determinant of (2*9) - (3*8) = -6. Multiplying this by 4 gives us -6*4 = -24. Since 4 is in an odd position, the sign of our answer is negative. Finally, we repeat the process for the third element, which is 7. This gives us a determinant of (2*6) - (3*5) = -3. Multiplying this by 7 gives us -3*7 = -21. Since 7 is in an even position, the sign of our answer is positive. We add our three results together (-3 - 24 + 21) to get a final answer of -6. In conclusion, the method described in this article is an efficient way to calculate the determinant of a 3 x 3 matrix by choosing a single row or column. It involves crossing out the row and column of each element in the chosen row or column and finding the determinant of the resulting 2 x 2 matrix, multiplying it by the chosen element, and determining the sign of the answer based on the position of the chosen element."},{"prompt":"Based on the sentence A dog is preparing to run away from a person interacting with it., is the sentence a cat is playing with some string a true sentence?

Brian Matthews has been presented in court where he has been accused of neglecting his vulnerable mother, Winifred. The court heard that Matthews only visited her once a month, leaving her to fend for herself. This has led to the deterioration of the living conditions of his mother's home. To add insult to injury, Matthews has also been accused of taking £18,000 of his mother's pension. This is a grave offence as his mother was entirely dependent on this pension to sustain herself. It is deplorable that Matthews chose to take advantage of his mother’s vulnerable state and take her money for personal profit.

It is a basic human right to be able to live in conditions that are clean and habitable. Matthews has denied responsibility for his actions, but the evidence against him is compelling.

The earliest symptoms are often subtle problems with mood or mental abilities. A general lack of coordination and an unsteady gait often follow. As the disease advances, uncoordinated, jerky body movements become more apparent. Physical abilities gradually worsen until coordinated movement becomes difficult and the person is unable to talk. Mental abilities generally decline into dementia. The specific symptoms vary somewhat between people. Symptoms usually begin between 30 and 50 years of age, but can start at any age. The disease may develop earlier in life in each successive generation.

Perform a squat stretch. Stretch the sole of your foot with your hands. Do all foot stretches gently.","completion":"Stretching is an essential part of any exercise routine. Stretching your muscles increases flexibility and range of motion, which can help prevent injuries and enhance performance. When we think about stretching, we tend to focus on larger muscle groups like the hamstrings or the quadriceps, but it's equally important to stretch smaller muscles like those in the feet. There are several foot stretches you can do to improve the flexibility and strength of muscles in the feet. One easy stretch is the wall stretch. Start by standing facing a wall with your feet hip-width apart. Place your hands on the wall at shoulder height, then slowly lean your body forward, keeping your heels on the ground. Hold the stretch for 20-30 seconds before releasing. Another stretch you can do is the squat stretch. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, then slowly lower your body into a squat position. Place your elbows inside your knees and gently press them outward, while keeping your heels on the ground. Hold the stretch for 20-30 seconds before standing back up. Stretching the sole of your foot with your hands is another useful technique. Sit on the ground with your legs straight out in front of you. Take a towel or strap and place it under the ball of your foot. Gently pull the towel towards your body with both hands, keeping your leg straight. Hold the stretch for 20-30 seconds before releasing and repeating on the other foot. It's important to remember to stretch all foot muscles gently. The muscles in the feet are small and delicate, so be sure not to overdo it. Incorporating these stretches into your exercise routine can help you improve the flexibility and strength of your feet, which can help prevent injuries and make everyday activities easier."},{"prompt":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Boon Brewery (Brouwerij Boon) is a Belgian brewery situated in Lembeek, near Brussels, that mainly produces geuze and kriek beer of a fairly traditional lambic variety, but using distinctly modern brewing techniques and equipment.

Additionally, hiring an experienced and reputable contractor is particularly important when it comes to dealing with mold. Mold can cause serious health issues and structural damage, which is why it is important to address mold as soon as it's detected. Hiring a licensed general contractor who is knowledgeable about properly removing and preventing mold is key. They can advise you on how to clean or avoid mold, and ensure that your project is mold-free. However, it's also important to get a moisture assessment.

When it comes to hiring an inspector for mold or moisture assessments, be sure to avoid scams from unethical inspectors.

Always research and choose a reputable inspector with a strong reputation in the community. In conclusion, when it comes to mold, prevention is key.

However, both clubs have their sights set on the elusive Champions League trophy, which could cloud their judgment as they prioritize this competition over others. In particular, Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini should consider not taking his key players to the Nou Camp for their upcoming match against Barcelona. With a 2-1 deficit from the first leg, Pellegrini may be tempted to rely on his star men to overturn the deficit. However, injuries or suspensions picked up in this crucial match could cause further harm to City's chances of winning a first ever Champions League title. Arsene Wenger's Arsenal face a similarly tough task as they travel to Bayern Munich, who lead 2-0 from the first leg. Wenger may feel that he has nothing to lose by fielding his strongest team, but the risk of injury or fatigue to his key players must be weighed against the low probability of a comeback. Turning to a more light-hearted topic, here are my top-five penalty takers of all time. First and foremost, it has to be Rickie Lambert, who has a near-perfect record from the spot. Frank Lampard also deserves a place on the list, having scored crucial penalties for Chelsea and England over the years.

The vista of the Grand Mosque of Mecca is absolutely stupendous and the audience is given a glimpse of a side of the Moslem world that is rarely of ever shown in the West.

The Republican National Committee spokesperson, Kirsten Kukowski, characterized the ads as \\"crass, insensitive and intolerant,\\" and applauded companies for rejecting them. Regardless of whether or not one agrees with the message of the ads, the rejection of the same ads in Tampa and the acceptance of them in Charlotte demonstrates the deep divide in America on religion and its role in politics."},{"prompt":"Trivia question: What was the English title of the TV crime drama, shown on BBC4 in 2012, set partly in Denmark and partly in Sweden?

This is especially useful for those days where you may not have gotten enough sleep or are feeling a bit tired. Simply applying a bit of white eyeliner on your waterline can do wonders for making you look more alert. Another way to experiment with white eyeliner is by using it as a base for your eyeshadow.

You can also use white eyeliner to create a subtle winged liner look, which is a great alternative to the classic black wing. When it comes to choosing a white eyeliner, it’s important to look for a formula that glides on smoothly and has good staying power. You’ll want to make sure that the white pigment is opaque and not sheer, so that it shows up well against your skin.

Despite extensive searches, no trace of them was found. Relatives of Captain Bridge initiated a search campaign that involved important resources, resulting in the U.S. Navy warship finding the wrecked hull over 1,000 miles from Cape Cod. However, that left little hope for a joint rescue mission comprising more than 20 vessels dispatched by the American authorities and the UK Coastguard. Unfortunately, this search party ended in vain as the undeployed life raft was found, and the hopes of finding the four sailors alive ended too. The sad news emerged after a week-long search that highlighted the committed efforts to find the missing yachtsmen. British Prime Minister David Cameron expressed his condolences upon learning about the sailors' death. He extended sympathies to the families of the missing persons, saying that the country shared the loss with the families who had done their best to search for their loved ones. Foreign Secretary William Hague also paid his respects and praised the naval search teams for their hard work. The boat wreckage was found far out in the Atlantic Ocean, some 1,000 miles east of Massachusetts by the coastguard on board the U.S. Navy warship \\"Jason Dunham\\". Investigations later revealed that the capsized hull showed no signs of distress, vessel impact, or having been hit by a larger craft. The causes of the incident remain undisclosed. In general, the sad climax that involved the missing sailors and the massive search effort targeted towards discovering them highlighted the extent of risks facing all seafarers in the severely changeable Atlantic weather patterns. The reactions of the nation's leaders have shown that the sailors' bravery will never be forgotten, and due respect must be accorded to all seafarers that bravely face these weather-related risks to thrive in their careers."},{"prompt":"dentify the most salient words in this sentence: people with burning incense praying for lucky and happy inside tourist attraction .","completion":"people, burning incense, praying, lucky, happy, tourist attraction."},{"prompt":"What is the answer: The title of Poet Laureate as a royal office was first conferred on which poet in 1670?","completion":"John Dryden."},{"prompt":"Question: when was bring it on all or nothing made??

However, there are a few tips and tricks that can help you find the perfect match for your skin tone. Firstly, it's important to try out several foundation shades before buying. This can be done by making an appointment with a makeup artist who can help guide you based on your skin tone and undertones, or by trying out different shades on your own. One useful tip is to try a few colors at once, applying a stripe of each shade on your cheek or jawline. This way, you can compare the colors side-by-side and see which one blends in seamlessly with your skin tone. Another important factor to consider is natural lighting. It's best to try out foundation shades in natural light, as artificial lighting can alter the appearance of the colors. This can be done by stepping outside or near a window to see how the foundation looks in natural light. Lastly, don't be afraid to ask for a second opinion from a friend or family member. Someone else's perspective can help you decide if a shade truly matches your skin tone, and can give you the confidence to make a final decision. Overall, choosing the right foundation shade takes a little bit of experimentation and patience.

While most gas stations are reliable, some may have faulty pumps or even malicious employees who are trying to cheat you out of your money. Here are some tips to help you avoid getting ripped off: First, make sure to print out your receipts every time you fill up your tank. This not only allows you to keep track of your spending, but it can also be important should you need to file a dispute with your bank or credit card company. Keep your receipts organized and in a safe place for future reference. Secondly, before you start pumping gasoline, take a look at the pump to ensure that there are no suspicious attachments or devices that might be trying to skim your credit card information. It's also important to check that the pump's meter is at zero before you begin filling up. Third, give the hose a gentle shake before you start pumping. This can help dislodge any air pockets that might be in the hose, which can lead to false readings on the pump's meter. You don't need to shake the hose too vigorously, just enough to get any bubbles moving. Finally, try to keep the dispenser in your tank for as long as possible. Sometimes, gas stations will pump a little bit of extra fuel into the dispenser before it's fully released to ensure that you're getting the full amount that you paid for. By keeping the dispenser in your tank for a few extra seconds, you'll be able to receive this extra fuel and get your money's worth. Overall, it's important to be mindful when it comes to buying gasoline. While most gas stations are reputable, there are always a few bad seeds out there who are trying to cheat their customers.

Whatever the cause, it's essential to survive and make the most of the holiday season. Here are some tips to help you do just that: 1. Allow yourself to grieve: It's natural to feel sad and upset after a breakup, especially during the holidays. Give yourself permission to grieve and process your emotions, whether that means crying, talking to a friend, or practicing self-care. 2. Set boundaries: If your ex is still in your life, it's essential to set boundaries so that you can move on. This may mean limiting contact, unfollowing them on social media, or avoiding places where you know they will be. 3. Lean on your support system: Don't be afraid to reach out to friends and family for support during this difficult time. They can provide a listening ear, distraction, and comfort. 4. Focus on yourself: Use this time to focus on your own goals and interests. Rediscover old hobbies, try something new, or take a trip to clear your head. 5. Embrace new traditions: The holidays may be difficult without your ex, but that doesn't mean you can't create new traditions and memories. Try doing something different, like volunteering at a shelter or going on a hike. 6. Don't rush into a new relationship: While it's tempting to seek comfort in the arms of someone new, it's important to give yourself time to heal before jumping into a new relationship. Take things slow and focus on your own growth. In conclusion, breakups during the holidays can be tough, but they don't have to ruin your entire season. By practicing self-care, setting boundaries, and focusing on yourself, you can survive and thrive during this trying time. Remember to lean on your support system, create new traditions, and take things one day at a time. Ultimately, with patience and perseverance, you will come out on the other side stronger and wiser than ever before."},{"prompt":"Read this: For maximum life, capacitors usually need to be able to handle the maximum amount of reversal that a system will experience. An AC circuit will experience 100% voltage reversal, while underdamped DC circuits will experience less than 100%.

Reversal ratings will often affect the design considerations for the capacitor, from the choice of dielectric materials and voltage ratings to the types of internal connections used. What percentage of voltage reversal will an over damped DC circuit experience? What is the answer?

It is difficult to pinpoint a precise number of years, as these invasions took place in different parts of the world and at various times. However, some of the most catastrophic invasions occurred during the period known as the Middle Ages, which lasted from the 5th century to the 15th century. During this time, several significant invasions took place, including the Viking invasions of Europe, the Arab invasions of Asia and Europe, and the Mongol invasions of Asia and Europe. These invasions were characterized by violence, bloodshed, and the destruction of cities, towns, and villages. They disrupted trade and commerce, destabilized political institutions, and caused widespread suffering and chaos. The Viking invasions of Europe, which occurred between the 8th and 11th centuries, were particularly damaging. The Vikings, who came from Scandinavia, terrorized coastal regions in Europe, raiding and pillaging cities and towns. They were known for their brutality and were feared throughout Europe. The Arab invasions of Asia and Europe, which took place between the 7th and 8th centuries, were also highly destructive. The Arab armies, led by Muslim generals, conquered vast territories in Asia and Europe, including parts of Spain, North Africa, and the Middle East. They destroyed many cities and landmarks, including the Library of Alexandria, one of the world's most important centers of learning. The Mongol invasions of Asia and Europe, which occurred between the 13th and 14th centuries, were perhaps the most devastating of all. Led by the great warrior Genghis Khan, the Mongols conquered vast territories in Asia and Europe, leaving a trail of destruction in their wake. They destroyed entire cities and killed millions of people, making them one of the deadliest invasions in history. In conclusion, the most damaging invasions in history occurred over a span of several centuries, during the Middle Ages.

Pick a night when the forecast calls for clear skies. Check the Kpindex before your photo shoot.","completion":"Article: Northern Lights: Capturing the Magnificent Aurora Borealis in the Arctic Circle If you are an avid nature photographer or just a curious traveler, you must consider planning a trip to the Arctic Circle during the months of November to March to witness one of the most breathtaking natural phenomena on Earth - the Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights. The Arctic Circle, which encompasses the region above 66.5 degrees latitude, provides the best chance of seeing this splendor, especially in places with minimal light pollution. The Aurora Borealis is a spectacular display of colored lights in the sky, caused by the interaction between Earth's magnetic field and charged particles from the sun. It can appear in green, pink, purple, blue, or red hues, and it moves or dances across the sky, creating an ethereal and mystical ambiance. The experience is truly unforgettable, and capturing it in photos can be a significant achievement for any photographer. To increase your chances of capturing the Aurora Borealis, you need to plan your trip carefully. Start by selecting a location that offers the best conditions for viewing and photographing. Ideally, you want to avoid cities or towns with bright lights that can interfere with the natural glow of the Aurora. Places like Norway, Iceland, Finland, Sweden, and Canada are popular destinations for Aurora chasers, and they have many vantage points for observing the lights. Once you have chosen your destination, it's time to pick the right time for your photo shoot. The best time to catch the Aurora is during a period of low solar activity - this usually occurs around the equinoxes in March and September. Still, there is no guarantee that you will see the Aurora even during these periods, so you need to be patient and adaptable. It is also crucial to check the weather forecast before you go - clear skies are ideal for viewing and photographing the Northern Lights. Another essential factor to consider is the Kp-index, which is a measure of geomagnetic activity that affects the intensity and visibility of the Aurora. The Kp-index ranges from 0 to 9, with 0 indicating low activity and 9 indicating a major magnetic storm. To maximize your chances of capturing the Aurora, aim for a Kp-index of 3 or above, which means a moderate or strong geomagnetic activity. You can monitor the Kp-index on various websites, such as the Space Weather Prediction Center or the Aurora Prediction Service. Once you arrive at your destination, be prepared for cold and harsh weather conditions. Dress in warm and waterproof clothing, bring a tripod, and familiarize yourself with your camera's manual settings for night photography. You may also want to bring snacks, hot drinks, and a portable heater or stove to keep yourself comfortable during long hours of waiting and shooting. In conclusion, planning a trip to the Arctic Circle to witness and photograph the Aurora Borealis is a thrilling adventure that requires careful preparation and patience. With the right location, timing, and equipment, you can capture the magic and beauty of this natural wonder and create lasting memories. Remember to respect the environment, follow the local rules, and enjoy the journey."},{"prompt":"Notre Dame rose to national prominence in the early 1900s for its Fighting Irish football team, especially under the guidance of the legendary coach Knute Rockne.

'I was trying to blow into his mouth trying to give him air. I knew from picking him up he had just gone limp,' she said. Midwife had 'no recollection' of family reporting problems with Fletcher. Coroner finds that doctors were right to send the newborn baby home.","completion":"An inquest has heard about a devastating case where a newborn baby died after his poor health was disregarded as \\"just wind\\". The mother of the baby, Fletcher Kennedy, revealed that her concerns over her son’s weak condition were dismissed. Despite her worries, doctors sent the three-day-old baby home with his mother, only for him to die shortly afterward. During the inquest, Gemma Smith, the mother of Fletcher Kennedy, recounted the moment when she tried to revive her baby: \\"I was trying to blow into his mouth, trying to give him air. I knew from picking him up he had just gone limp,\\" she said. The young mother also revealed that she had been assured by midwives that the baby’s condition was normal. While midwives had “no recollection” of the family reporting problems with Fletcher, the inquest found that doctors had made the correct decision in sending the newborn baby home. The tragedy has inevitably resulted in a deep sense of loss and heartbreak for the family. The death of a child is always a devastating experience, and the parents of Fletcher deserve answers regarding the care their child received. It is essential that professionals take all signs of poor health seriously and listen carefully to parents’ concerns. Babies are not always able to fully express their discomfort or symptoms, hence it is important for caregivers to be vigilant when assessing infants. It is also imperative for medical personnel to be diligent in the way that they deal with any issues, including following up promptly with concerned parents or guardians. This tragic case will hopefully serve as a wake-up call for caregivers and medical professionals alike. The hope is that lessons learned from this inquest will lead to more diligent and proactive care for newborn babies, preventing senseless deaths like that of Fletcher from happening again. Ultimately, every child, regardless of their circumstances or age, deserves the best possible care and attention."},{"prompt":"Please answer this question: What was Jesus's crown made of?","completion":"Jesus's crown was made of thorns."},{"prompt":"Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? as little cleavage OPTIONS: negative positive","completion":"The given phrase \\"as little cleavage\\" is generally considered as negative."},{"prompt":"Does The city has also attracted foreign investment, multinational firms such as Siemens, Ericsson, Volkswagen, Iveco, A.O.

Replace flimsy strike plates. Secure exposed hinges. Fortify your frame.","completion":"Installing cylinder guards, replacing flimsy strike plates, securing exposed hinges, and fortifying your door frame are all simple steps that you can take to increase the security of your home. These are particularly important if you live in an area where break-ins are common or if you simply want to ensure that your home is as secure as possible. Cylinder guards are metal plates that fit around the lock cylinders on your door. They can help to prevent someone from drilling into the lock or using other tools to try to gain entry. Installing these guards is a simple process that can be done by most homeowners. All you need is a drill, screws, and the cylinder guard itself. Simply remove the existing screws on the lock cylinder and replace them with the longer screws included with the guard. Flimsy strike plates are another common weak point on most doors. These are the thin pieces of metal that are attached to the door frame and into which the lock latch is inserted. Most strike plates are held in place with only a few small screws, which makes them easy to break or pry open. Replacing these with thicker, stronger strike plates can help to make it much more difficult for someone to force their way through your door. Exposed hinges are another common weak point on most doors. These are the parts of the door that allow it to swing open and closed. If they are not secured properly, they can be easily removed, allowing someone to gain entry to your home. To prevent this, simply replace the exposed hinges with ones that are mounted on the inside of the door. This makes it much harder for someone to remove the door from its hinges. Finally, fortifying your door frame is one of the most effective ways to increase the security of your home. Most door frames are made of thin, flimsy wood that can be easily broken or kicked in. By adding a metal reinforcement plate to the frame, you can make it much stronger and more resistant to forced entry. Overall, these four simple steps can go a long way in improving the security of your home. By taking the time to install cylinder guards, replace flimsy strike plates, secure exposed hinges, and fortify your frame, you can help to deter potential intruders and keep your home safe and secure."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"search-container"},M={class:"card-container"},R={key:0,class:"empty-state"},D=["disabled"],H={key:0},q={key:1};function F(i,e,h,m,n,s){const u=g("PoemCard");return o(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",B,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(o(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",M,[(o(!0),a(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(o(),k(u,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(o(),a("div",R,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
