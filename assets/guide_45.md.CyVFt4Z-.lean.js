I only discovered this pub a couple of days ago, after going to St Stephen's to see a show. It's a little basement pub tucked away on a street just off Stockbridge. I like it because it's got a wee outside area with parasols, has Lia Fail and Addlestone's Cider on tap and just seems to have quite a lot of attitude. There's also this hilarious barrel behind the bar with a huge sign on it that reads ABSINTHE! 3.75 a shot. Only two shots per person per night. Which makes me laugh, though I might be the only one who gets a kick out of that. A pint of ale will cost you around 3 pounds and same goes for the cider, so it's not too pricey, though I've definitely been to cheaper places.

The goalkeeper has been a crucial part of City's success over the years and knows what it takes to win the Premier League. Despite a slow start to the season, City has shown glimpses of their true potential and has bounced back with some impressive performances. The team's attacking prowess, led by striker Sergio Aguero, has been a constant threat to opposition teams. City's next test comes in the form of Liverpool, who they face on Sunday. A win in this match could help them close the gap on the league leaders Chelsea and boost the team's morale going forward. Pep Guardiola's side will have to be at their best to overcome Liverpool, who have had a solid start to the campaign themselves. With Virgil van Dijk marshaling the defense and Mohamed Salah leading the attack, Liverpool has proven to be a formidable opponent. However, City has the experience and the talent to come out on top in this match. The players will be motivated to put in a strong performance and get the three points that could keep them in the title race. In conclusion, Manchester City may be trailing Chelsea by five points, but they have the quality and experience to defend their title. The match against Liverpool on Sunday is a crucial one, and a win could go a long way in boosting their confidence for the rest of the season. City fans will be hoping that their team can replicate the success they have enjoyed in recent years and continue to dominate the English Premier League."},{"prompt":"Worst service I've ever gotten.

Most important was the pervasive secularism that came to dominate American public life, which sought to confine religion to a private sphere. Further, the ban against government aid to religious schools was supported before 1970 by most Protestants (and most Jews), who opposed aid to religious schools, which were mostly Catholic at the time. After 1980, however, antiCatholic sentiment has diminished among mainline Protestants, and the crucial coalition of public secularists and Protestant churches has collapsed. While mainline Protestant denominations are more inclined towards strict separation of church and state, much evangelical opinion has now largely deserted that position. As a consequence, strict separationism is opposed today by members of many Protestant faiths, even perhaps eclipsing the opposition of Roman Catholics.[citation needed] What position do Jeffries and Ryan argue was the reason for support from a coalition of separationists?","completion":"Jeffries and Ryan argue that the no-aid position, which bans government aid to religious schools, was the reason for support from a coalition of separationists."},{"prompt":"TherevolutionaryLGCFileAnalysisTool™scans,analyzes,andreportsbackeverydetailaboutyourLGCfile.

At this time most of the regional nobility were closely linked through kinship, and this behaviour towards their relatives was regarded as unacceptable. William de Roches and other of John's regional allies in Anjou and Brittany deserted him in favour of Philip, and Brittany rose in fresh revolt.

It's important to note that heat protectant products should also be used before using a flat iron, regardless of your hair texture. This will add an extra layer of protection and help prevent damage.

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"The US Supreme Court has dismissed an appeal involving the 1964 kidnapping of two African American teenagers, James Ford Seale, who was found guilty in 2007. The hearing was regarding whether a civil rights crime can be prosecuted decades later. Seale had appealed his conviction on the basis that the statute of limitations had expired. However, the indictment stands and the question of whether similar cases can be prosecuted remains unanswered. The case dates back to May 1964, when two African American teenagers, Charles Eddie Moore and Henry Hezekiah Dee, were kidnapped and murdered by the Ku Klux Klan in Mississippi. The case was reopened in 2005 and Seale was indicted in 2007. He was found guilty of two counts of kidnapping and one count of conspiracy to kidnap and sentenced to three life terms. Seale's appeal reached the US Supreme Court, where the justices were asked to decide whether a civil rights crime committed decades ago could still be prosecuted. The court dismissed the appeal, but the question remains as to whether similar cases can be prosecuted. The decision has been widely welcomed by civil rights campaigners and families of victims of historic crimes. It is hoped that the ruling will pave the way for the prosecution of other individuals involved in historic civil rights crimes.

Although the app may seem controversial, it has stirred buzz among different groups of people. Some see it as an excellent tool to improve their sexual performance by measuring their thrusts and timing, while others criticize it for invading their privacy. The app's functionality is pretty seamless; users only need to place their iPhones or Apple Watches near their bed while they engage in sexual activity. The app records the data and presents it in an easy-to-read format, including charts and graphs. It records the duration of the session, the average decibel level, thrusts per minute, and the total number of thrusts. However, some have raised concerns about the app's ability to collect intimate data without proper security measures.

The committee pointed out that parts of Buckingham Palace do not meet acceptable standards, and courtiers need to take a firmer grip on finances. The royal household's net expenditure was £33.3m in 2012/13, which was 7% more than their income. In order to compensate, the Palace took £2.3m from its reserves, leaving the Queen with just £1m in the bank.

While some argue that increasing the Palace's opening season may compromise the privacy of the royal family, the cost of maintaining the buildings, many of which are centuries old, continues to mount. The public accounts committee has urged the royal household to embrace new revenue streams to protect the integrity of these historic structures. It remains to be seen whether the royal family will heed the committee's advice, but with a growing backlog of repairs, it seems inevitable that additional sources of funding will need to be identified.

Keeping your locks healthy and strong is key to looking your best. One way to do this is by using the right products for your hair type, and this includes shampoo and conditioner specifically made for brunettes. When shopping for shampoo and conditioner, look for ones that are formulated to enhance brown hair. These products often contain natural ingredients that bring out the richness and shine of brown hair, while also preventing damage caused by styling and environmental factors.

Mix a tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa powder with your shampoo before use, and be sure to rinse well. The cocoa powder will help bring out the natural tones and highlights of your brown hair, leaving it looking lustrous and refreshed.

Surrogate mothers charge around £4,000 in India, a fraction of the US cost. There are 3,000 fertility clinics in India, but they're vilified by campaigners.","completion":"Surrogacy, the act of carrying a child for another person or couple, has become a controversial practice in many countries. Only a few nations allow women to make money from surrogacy, with some even prohibiting the act completely. However, in India, it is legal and relatively cheap. Surrogate mothers in India typically charge around £4,000, which is a fraction of the cost in the United States. This affordability has made India a popular destination for couples who struggle with infertility or cannot carry a child themselves. It has also led to the rise of the surrogacy industry in India, with an estimated 3,000 fertility clinics in the country. However, this increase in the surrogacy industry has been vilified by campaigners who argue that it exploits vulnerable women from impoverished backgrounds. The practice of surrogacy in India has faced criticism from both within India and internationally. There have been reports of exploitation, unethical practices, and inadequate regulation in the Indian surrogacy industry. For example, women have been kept in cramped and unsanitary living conditions while they carry a child, and sometimes denied basic healthcare services. Despite these criticisms, surrogacy continues to be a viable option for many couples in India and abroad. The relatively low cost of surrogacy in India has made it an attractive option for couples who cannot afford the high prices charged in developed nations. However, more needs to be done to ensure that the rights and well-being of surrogate mothers are protected and that the industry is better regulated. In conclusion, the surrogacy industry in India has its benefits and drawbacks. Surrogacy provides a means for couples struggling with infertility to have children and has boosted the economy in India, with the growth of fertility clinics. However, it is essential to ensure that the rights of surrogate mothers are protected and ethical practices are followed to avoid potential exploitation."},{"prompt":"what was to become a tradition, Clarkson performed the coronation song during the finale, and released the song immediately after the season ended.

Reza Baluchi, an ultra-marathoner, was attempting yet another impressive feat after claiming to have run across the United States twice. However, the Coast Guard stepped in to urge Baluchi to abandon his quest. They argued that he did not have enough supplies to safely complete the journey.

Between 1970 to 1975, the life expectancy for both males and females was approximately 45 years. However, the latest data from 2011 to 2015 shows that the life expectancy has increased to around 72 years for males and 75 years for females. This means that the life expectancy at birth has increased by almost 60% in the last four decades. The increase in life expectancy can be attributed to several factors, including improved healthcare facilities, better nutrition, education and awareness, and advances in medical technologies. Himachal Pradesh has made significant progress in expanding its health infrastructure, with the government investing heavily in strengthening primary healthcare services in rural areas. As a result, more people now have access to basic healthcare services, including immunization and maternal and child health services. The state has also implemented several successful health programs, such as the Rastriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY) and the National Health Mission (NHM), which aim to improve the overall health status of the population. These programs have helped improve the quality of healthcare services, especially for the poor and marginalized sections of society. The improvement in life expectancy is also a reflection of the state's socio-economic development. Himachal Pradesh has made significant progress in education and has one of the highest literacy rates in the country. The state has also witnessed significant economic growth, with a thriving tourism industry contributing significantly to the state's revenue. In conclusion, the life expectancy at birth in Himachal Pradesh has increased by almost 60% between 1970-1975 and 2011-2015, primarily due to the government's efforts in improving healthcare infrastructure and expanding health services.

A restriction on him being in possession of more than £1,000 to ‘make it harder for him to purchase drugs or reward his criminal associates’;.

With an estimated wealth of £198 million, the 57-year-old has become one of the wealthiest criminals in the country. However, his riches may soon come under threat as he faces a possible order that limits his use of communication devices and public telephones, places a restriction on him possessing more than £1,000, and requires him to report his finances to authorities. Warren, who has a long history of drug trafficking and other criminal activities, has served time in prison for his crimes. During one of his previous sentences, he made headlines when he killed a convicted murderer during a fight. Despite his violent past, Warren is now trying to fight the proposed order on the grounds of his \\"human rights.\\" The order has been proposed by the National Crime Agency (NCA), which aims to limit Warren's ability to continue his criminal pursuits. The restriction on communication devices and public telephones is designed to prevent Warren from conducting illegal activities and coordinating with his criminal associates. The financial reporting requirement is intended to deter him from acquiring wealth through illegal means and give authorities a chance to investigate any unexplained wealth. The restriction on Warren's ability to possess more than £1,000 is perhaps the most significant aspect of the order. With such a limit in place, it would be much harder for Warren to purchase drugs or reward his criminal contacts. This would significantly impact his ability to continue his illicit activities, which is the main objective of the NCA's proposed order. In conclusion, Curtis Warren's inclusion on the Sunday Times Rich List has drawn attention to the vast wealth that can be amassed through criminal activities. While Warren may fight the order, it is clear that the NCA is taking a proactive approach to limit his ability to conduct further criminal activities. Time will tell whether the proposed restrictions have the desired effect, but it is heartening to see that authorities are taking steps to tackle organized crime and protect the wider community."},{"prompt":"Math problem: Solve 875*v 40742 = 316*v 376*v for v.

Lowering the pressure of your car tires, for instance, can provide better traction and stability. The surface of the tire can also have better contact with the road, which can help prevent skidding and hydroplaning during wet conditions. In addition, using a lower pressure can also help reduce fuel consumption. This is because lower pressure tires can be more flexible and absorb road imperfections, which in turn minimizes the energy needed to propel the vehicle. However, it is important to note that not all vehicles benefit from a reduction in tire pressure. Some manufacturers have specific recommended pressure levels for their vehicles, and deviating from those levels can negatively impact the overall performance and safety of the vehicle. Therefore, it is always best to consult the owner's manual or a reputable mechanic before making any adjustments to tire pressure. In summary, switching to a lower pressure can be a simple and effective way to improve safety and fuel efficiency, but it is important to proceed with caution and follow the recommended guidelines for your specific vehicle."},{"prompt":"Some researchers believe that the first Russian settlement in Alaska was established in the 17th century.

During World War I, Yudenich was initially assigned to the Northwestern front, but later commanded troops on the Southwestern and Caucasian fronts. He became known for his strategic abilities and was promoted to general in 1915. Yudenich played a key role in the Brusilov Offensive in 1916, which was one of the most successful Russian offensives of the war. After the October Revolution of 1917, Yudenich became an opponent of the Bolsheviks and joined the White Army during the Russian Civil War. He was appointed commander-in-chief of the Northwestern Army in 1918 and launched an offensive against Soviet forces in Estonia. However, Yudenich's forces were ultimately defeated and he fled to Finland in 1919. He continued to be active in anti-Bolshevik activities and became a prominent figure in the émigré community. Yudenich lived in France in the 1920s and 1930s, where he was involved in various anti-Soviet organizations. Nikolai Yudenich died in 1933 at the age of 71.

However, tensions began to rise between the two groups as English settlers continued to push into Susquehannock territory. In 1637, war broke out between the English and Susquehannock, with the English capturing and executing several of the tribe's chiefs. This was only a few years after the alliance was formed, and it marked a significant shift in the relationship between the two groups. The reasons behind the conflict are complex and multifaceted, but a key factor was the English desire for land and resources. As more and more settlers arrived in the region, the pressure on the Susquehannock to cede their lands and resources to the English increased. The war between the English and Susquehannock was brutal and bloody, with both sides committing acts of violence and cruelty. In the end, the English emerged victorious and the Susquehannock were forced to submit to English control. The capture and execution of the Susquehannock chiefs was a turning point in the relationship between the English and the Native American tribes of the region.

One such practice that can lead to a positive impact is reducing the usage of paper towels, tissues, and napkins. These products end up in landfills, leading to massive waste production. Instead, we can use recycled toilet paper that is just as effective and eco-friendly. Similarly, investing in a reusable coffee mug reduces our plastic waste and saves money too. We can also choose paperless options for bills to reduce the usage of paper.

Despite potential consequences, Saudi Arabia has promised to make up for any aid that the United States cuts, further complicating the situation. This move could result in closer ties between Egypt and Saudi Arabia, potentially shifting the balance of power in the region. However, if the United States were to cut off aid, Egypt could retaliate by modifying American preferential access to the Suez Canal. This could have far-reaching economic and geopolitical implications, and highlights the intricate nature of the relationship between the two countries.

According to police, the perpetrator was Charles Hammer, an 81-year-old ex-con who was motivated by bitter revenge. Proffitt had arrested Hammer back in 2002. The incident occurred when Proffitt went to fetch the mail, something he did routinely. Hammer, who had harbored a grudge against Proffitt over the years, seized the opportunity to settle the score. He shot Proffitt multiple times before fleeing the scene. The police quickly launched an investigation and managed to track down Hammer, who was found in his home, surrounded by weapons and ammunition. He was arrested and charged with murder. The community has been left in shock by the tragedy. Proffitt was a well-respected member of the community, known for his kindness and generosity. He had dedicated much of his life to serving his fellow citizens, both as a police officer and as a volunteer in various community organizations. Hammer, on the other hand, had a troubled past. He had been in and out of prison for most of his life, and had a reputation for violence and aggression. Despite this, many in the community are struggling to understand how he could have resorted to such extreme measures. The case has reignited debates about the need for stricter gun control laws, with many calling for tighter restrictions on access to firearms for those with a history of violence or mental illness. In the meantime, the community is coming together to mourn the loss of a beloved member and to support his family in their time of grief.

On both occasions, Galileo seems to have mistaken Neptune for a fixed star when it appeared close—in conjunction—to Jupiter in the night sky; hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent backward motion is created when Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope.

However, many people find it challenging to move from thinking about what is right and wrong to taking action. The good news is that it is possible to use your knowledge of right and wrong to move from thinking to doing. One way to do this is by working on your communication skills. Verbalizing your thoughts and emotions allows you to express yourself better and make more informed decisions. Practice techniques such as active listening, expressing empathy, and clear communication to ensure that you always communicate effectively. Another effective strategy is to practice techniques that put your conscience into action. Don't just know what is right and wrong; take the necessary steps to do what is right, even when it is challenging. Some of these techniques include mediation, conflict resolution, and compromise. Setting specific goals for using your conscience in daily activities is another useful strategy. Goals help to keep you focused and motivated in your pursuit of doing what is right. For example, you could set a goal to volunteer for a social cause every month or make ethical purchases when shopping. Most importantly, living your values and standing up for your beliefs are essential in moving from thinking to doing. You must be aware of your values and principles and always strive to align your actions with them. Furthermore, you must be willing to stand up for your beliefs, even when it's not popular or easy. In summary, moving from thinking to doing requires deliberate action. By working on your communication skills, practicing techniques that put your conscience into action, setting specific goals, living your values, and standing up for your beliefs, you can make a positive difference in your life and society."},{"prompt":"Write an article based on this Build a strong support system. Delegate when you can. Practice selfcare.","completion":"Building a Strong Support System: The Secret to Success Success is not a one-person job. Behind every successful person is a team of individuals who have helped them along the way. These individuals are often known as a support system. A support system is a group of people who provide emotional, physical, and mental support to help individuals achieve their goals. Building a strong support system is essential for anyone who wants to be successful in life. Delegate When You Can One of the keys to building a strong support system is learning to delegate. Many people feel like they can do everything on their own. However, delegating tasks to others can free up a lot of time and energy for the things that truly matter. It is essential to build trust in your team and assign tasks that play to each member's strengths. This way, each task will be performed efficiently, and each member of the team will feel valued. Practice Self-Care Another essential element of building a strong support system is to practice self-care. It is impossible to be successful if you're exhausted, burnt out, or constantly overstressed. Self-care can mean different things to different people: it can be as simple as taking a walk outside, reading a good book, or even taking a nap. Make sure to schedule regular self-care activities into your week to ensure that you're taking care of your physical, emotional, and mental health. Build Your Support System Building a strong support system is about having people who can help you when you need it most. When looking to build your support system, it's essential to remember that quality is more important than quantity. Choose individuals who belief in you, support you, and are willing to help you achieve your goals. Remember to reciprocate the same level of support and care to those around you. In conclusion, building a strong support system is essential for success in any aspect of life. Delegating tasks, practicing self-care, and surrounding yourself with supportive people are crucial elements for achieving your goals. Remember that success is not a solitary effort, and building a strong support team will help you navigate through any challenge that comes your way."},{"prompt":"Sentence: name = The Golden Curry, eatType = restaurant, food = Chinese, food = English, priceRange = more than £30, familyFriendly = yes, near = The Bakers Can you represent the content in this sentence in data form?","completion":"Yes, here is the information represented in data form: - Name: The Golden Curry - Eat Type: restaurant - Food: Chinese, English - Price Range: more than £30 - Family-Friendly: yes - Location: near The Bakers"},{"prompt":"What would be an example of an negative review?","completion":"An example of a negative review is: \\"Terrible experience at this restaurant.

Gunman opens fire Friday at Los Angeles International Airport. TSA screens about 1.8 million passengers and their luggage daily for prohibited items.","completion":"The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) plays an important role in ensuring the safety of air travel, and part of their job includes screening passengers and their luggage for prohibited items. Unfortunately, it seems that despite their best efforts, more people are attempting to bring firearms onto planes. In 2012, TSA seized 1,556 guns at airport checkpoints across the United States. This number is nearly double the amount from 2007, indicating a troubling trend. It’s understandable that some people may forget they have their firearm in their carry-on bag, but it’s crucial to remember that firearms are prohibited from being brought onto planes for a reason - they pose a serious safety threat. This became painfully clear on Friday, November 1st when a gunman opened fire at Los Angeles International Airport, killing a TSA agent and injuring several others. The shooter had a rifle in his luggage and was able to get past security without incident. This tragic event highlights just how important TSA’s job is, and why they need to take their role seriously. However, it’s worth noting that TSA screens roughly 1.8 million passengers and their luggage every day, so while the number of guns seized may be increasing, the overall rate of people attempting to bring firearms onto planes is still relatively low. It’s also worth noting that TSA’s protocols and procedures may not catch every gun or prohibited item, but their efforts are critical in preventing potential threats from making it onto airplanes. In conclusion, the increased number of guns being seized by TSA is concerning, but it highlights the importance of their work in screening passengers and their luggage for prohibited items. The recent shooting at LAX serves as a tragic reminder of just how critical their role is in ensuring the safety of air travel. It’s important for passengers to also remember their role in this process and to double-check their bags before heading to the airport to help keep everyone safe."},{"prompt":"PleasenotethatchildrencanonlybeaccommodatedintheComfortFamilyRoom.

This marks a significant move for Arsenal, as they have beaten rival clubs to secure the talented German midfielder's services. Ozil, who had been with Real Madrid since 2010, played a key role in their recent successes, including the 2012 and 2013 La Liga titles, and the 2014 Champions League win. Another transfer saga currently unfolding in the Premier League involves Everton's midfielder, Marouane Fellaini. He has reportedly handed in a transfer request, but the club is yet to agree on a fee with Manchester United, who are eager to sign the Belgian international. Fellaini was a key player for Everton last season, and his potential departure could potentially impact their performance during the current season. The biggest transfer news of the summer, however, has been the world-record move of Welsh superstar Gareth Bale to Real Madrid. The Spanish club paid an unprecedented £86m for his services, making him the most expensive player in history. Bale was unveiled in front of Real Madrid fans recently, signaling the beginning of his time at the club, where he will be expected to replicate the kind of form that saw him score 31 goals for Tottenham last season. Meanwhile, two Premier League clubs - Everton and West Brom - are currently embroiled in a tussle over Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku. The Belgian international spent the last season on loan at West Brom, where he impressed a great deal. However, he has since returned to his parent club and is keen to find a new home where he can continue to play regularly. Everton and West Brom will both be hoping to secure his signature, as he would be an invaluable addition to their respective squads. Finally, Liverpool has made three signings recently: Mamadou Sakho and Tiago Ilori have joined the club permanently, while Victor Moses has been signed on loan. Sakho is a French international defender who previously played for Paris Saint-Germain, while Ilori is a promising young centre-back who joined from Portuguese club Sporting Lisbon. Moses, who is a Nigerian winger, will be looking to boost Liverpool's attacking options during his loan spell at the club. In other transfer news, Hull have agreed on a £5m fee with West Brom for striker Shane Long, who is currently undergoing a medical in Yorkshire. The Irishman scored eight goals in 40 appearances for the Baggies last season and will be looking to improve Hull's attacking options in their campaign this season. Overall, this summer has been an eventful one for Premier League clubs, as they continue to make crucial signings and prepare for the coming season."},{"prompt":"Answer this question: who won season 7 rupaul's drag race??","completion":"Violet Chachki."},{"prompt":"Generate a sentence, and then tell me the concepts included in that sentence.","completion":"Sentence: \\"The cat sat on the windowsill watching the birds outside.\\" Concepts: 1.

It helps keep your food fresh and safe to eat. But did you know that how you organize your refrigerator also plays a crucial role in maintaining food safety and freshness? Here are some tips on how to properly arrange your fridge for optimal food storage. Top Shelf: Ready-to-Eat Foods and Drinks The top shelf of your refrigerator should be reserved for ready-to-eat foods and drinks. These are items that do not require any further cooking or preparation before consumption, such as leftover meals, drinks, and prepared salads or fruits. Keeping them on the top shelf ensures that they are easily accessible and less likely to be forgotten or pushed out of sight. Middle Shelf or Crisper: Raw Produce The middle shelf or crisper drawers are the ideal spots for storing fresh produce. This includes fruits, vegetables, and herbs, as well as any other perishable items such as eggs and dairy products. Keeping raw produce on the middle shelf helps maintain a consistent temperature for optimal freshness and safety. Use the crisper drawers to store delicate produce that is easily wilted, such as lettuce and herbs. Lower Shelf: Raw Meats Raw meats should be stored on the lower shelf of your refrigerator. This helps prevent any juices or drips from contaminating other foods and surfaces in your fridge. Use a separate container or tray to store raw meats to make cleanup easier and to prevent cross-contamination. Door: Condiments The door of your refrigerator is often the warmest part of the appliance, making it the best spot to store condiments such as ketchup, mustard, and salad dressings. Condiments are often high in salt or vinegar, which act as natural preservatives, making them less susceptible to spoilage. Keep in mind that the door should not be used to store perishable items that require a consistent temperature. Cheese Drawer: Cheese and Lunch Meats Many modern refrigerators come with a special cheese drawer designed to keep cheeses and lunch meats at an optimal temperature and humidity level. If your fridge doesn't have a cheese drawer, you can use the bottom shelf to store these items. Cheese and lunch meats should be wrapped tightly to prevent drying out and to prevent the spread of any bacteria. In conclusion, organizing your refrigerator is an essential part of maintaining food safety and freshness. By following these tips, you can ensure that your food stays at its best for longer, while also reducing the risk of foodborne illness. So take some time to rearrange your fridge and enjoy your fresh, healthy, and delicious food!"},{"prompt":"First question: What would happen if AntMan went inside the Hulk, then went super sized?

By 1909, the number of Jewish residents had risen to over 250,000, accounting for approximately 38% of the city's population. This increase can be attributed to several factors, including the influx of Jewish immigrants from surrounding areas and the increasing number of opportunities for employment in the city's growing industries. In particular, the textile industry provided many jobs for Jewish workers and contributed to the community's growth and prosperity. However, this growth also led to tensions and conflicts between the Jewish community and other groups in the city. Anti-Semitic sentiments were on the rise, and many Jewish residents faced discrimination and violence. Despite these challenges, the Jewish community in Warsaw continued to thrive in the years leading up to World War II. By the outbreak of the war, over 350,000 Jews were living in the city, making up around 30% of the population. However, the Nazi invasion and subsequent occupation of Warsaw led to the persecution and genocide of the Jewish population, with most residents either killed or sent to concentration camps.

Red, green and blue light combined together makes white light, and these three colors, combined in different mixtures, can produce nearly any other color. This is the principle that is used to make all of the colors on your computer screen and your television. For example, purple on a computer screen is made by a similar formula to used by Cennino Cennini in the Renaissance to make violet, but using additive colors and light instead of pigment: it is created by combining red and blue light at equal intensity on a black screen.

When he was at Cambridge in the 1930s he knew Anthony Blunt, Guy Burgess and other Soviet agents, who were recruited by Marxists. Four years before his death said he wanted to see MI5 files on him to find out who had 'snitched on him'","completion":"The idea of defending the Soviet killing of millions of people in the name of Communism is highly controversial and disturbing for most people. However, one historian who openly supported this idea was Eric Hobsbawm. Hobsbawm was a highly respected historian who specialized in European history, and he was a prominent member of the Communist Party of Great Britain. When Hobsbawm was at Cambridge University in the 1930s, he associated with a group of intellectuals and left-wing activists who were also sympathetic to Marxist ideas. Among these individuals were Anthony Blunt and Guy Burgess, who later turned out to be Soviet agents. Despite their political differences, Hobsbawm maintained a positive relationship with these individuals and continued to defend the Communist cause. In his later years, Hobsbawm became increasingly interested in his own personal history and legacy. He expressed a desire to see MI5 files on him, presumably to find out who had provided information to the intelligence services about his activities. This request itself has caused controversy, with some arguing that it is evidence of a guilty conscience on Hobsbawm's part. Regardless of how one feels about Hobsbawm's political views and associations, there is no denying that he was a highly influential figure in the field of history. His books on the rise of capitalism, the Industrial Revolution, and the role of social movements in shaping modern Europe have all been widely read and have had a significant impact on the field of history. However, his defense of the Soviet killing of millions in the name of Communism will always be a controversial aspect of his legacy. Even though he believed in the ideals of Marxism and Communism, it is difficult to reconcile these ideas with the atrocities committed by the Soviet regime under Stalin's leadership. Overall, Eric Hobsbawm was a complex and controversial figure whose work continues to be debated and discussed by historians and intellectuals around the world. Whether one agrees with his views or not, there is no denying the impact he had on the field of history and the political discourse of his time."},{"prompt":"Sentence: name = The Waterman, eatType = restaurant, priceRange = less than £20, customer rating = low, area = riverside, familyFriendly = no Can you represent the content in this sentence in data form?","completion":"{\\"name\\": \\"The Waterman\\", \\"eatType\\": \\"restaurant\\", \\"priceRange\\": \\"less than £20\\", \\"customer rating\\": \\"low\\", \\"area\\": \\"riverside\\", \\"familyFriendly\\": \\"no\\"}"},{"prompt":"Education, Youth, Culture and Sport (EYSC) Make this lower case","completion":"education, youth, culture and sport (EYSC)"},{"prompt":"What are important things for people intending to major in aviation to know about?

It uses a form of lossy data compression to encode data using inexact approximations and partial data discarding to reduce file sizes, typically by a factor of 10, in comparison with a CD while retaining a sound quality comparable to uncompressed audio. Compared to CD quality digital audio, MP3 compression commonly achieves 75 to 95% reduction in size. MP3 files are thus 1/4 to 1/20 the size of the original digital audio stream. This is important for both transmission and storage concerns. The basis for such comparison is the CD digital audio format which requires 1411.2 kbit/s. A commonly used MP3 encoding setting is CBR 128 kbit/s resulting in file of 1/11 (=9%) of the size of the original CDquality file, that is with 91% compression.

The Washington Post editorial board has had enough of the tinkering: Its members are fed up with President Obama’s increasingly cavalier approach to picking and choosing how to enforce this law.

The difference is that there was campiness in Nicholson's performance that isn't at all in this film.

Everything doesn't seem to come together very smoothly and the viewer is left with a lot of pieces of information and no real understanding of what happened in the film. There is a very small throwaway performance by Christopher Walken as the uncle of the granddaughter which, of course, gives him topbilling in an attempt to sell the film.
