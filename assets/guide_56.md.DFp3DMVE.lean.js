The creamy texture of avocado makes it an excellent addition to any protein shake or green smoothie. It also provides a healthy source of fat that can keep you feeling full and satisfied. Second, try making avocado energy bars. These are perfect for a quick snack on the go or as a post-workout treat. The heart-healthy fats in avocado provide sustained energy throughout the day. Third, experiment with avocado-banana pancakes. Swap out regular pancake mix for a recipe that includes mashed avocado and banana for a fluffy and nutritious breakfast alternative. These pancakes are high in fiber and healthy fats, keeping you full and satisfied for hours. Fourth, bake an egg in your avocado. Cut an avocado in half, remove the pit, and crack an egg into each half. Bake in the oven until the egg is cooked to your liking. This makes for a filling and protein-packed breakfast. Fifth, substitute mashed avocado for unhealthy fats in baked goods. Avocado can replace butter or oil in muffins, cakes, and bread, reducing the calorie count and adding a healthy dose of fat. Lastly, top your toast with mashed avocado. Simply mash ripe avocado onto a piece of toast and add toppings such as tomato, feta cheese, or a poached egg for a satisfying breakfast or lunch.

It often involves monitoring one's own cognitive activity during the thinking process.

Not only does regular physical activity help us maintain a healthy weight, but it also improves our overall health and helps reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure. To reap the benefits of exercise, it is recommended that we engage in cardiovascular exercise (or cardio) at least four times a week. This can include activities such as brisk walking, biking, or swimming. Additionally, interval training is a great way to mix up your routine and get the most out of your workouts. By alternating periods of high-intensity exercise with periods of rest, you can burn more calories and improve your overall fitness. Strength training is also an important component of any exercise routine. Building and maintaining muscle mass is vital for maintaining a healthy metabolism and reducing the risk of injury. Even if you don't have access to a gym or weightlifting equipment, there are plenty of bodyweight exercises that you can do at home, such as push-ups, squats, and lunges. If possible, try to exercise early in the day. Doing so can help to jumpstart your metabolism and give you more energy throughout the day. If you're not a morning person, don't worry - any time of day is a good time to exercise. Finally, try to make choices that involve more activity throughout the day. Take the stairs instead of the elevator, go for a walk during your lunch break, or park farther away from the store so you have to walk a bit more. These small choices can add up to big health benefits over time. By incorporating exercise into our daily routine, we can improve our physical health, mental wellbeing, and overall quality of life.

That means about 70,000 women a year undergo unnecessary treatment, say the researchers, who assert that about onethird of all tumors discovered in mammograms will never result in cancer. The findings will do little to settle the issue, based on the early reaction from proponents of the tests, notes the Washington Post. Two competing quotes: Our study raises serious questions about the value of screening mammography, says Dr. H. Gilbert Welch of Dartmouth. It clarifies that the benefit of mortality reduction reduction is probably smaller, and the harm of overdiagnosis probably larger, than has been previously recognized. This is simply malicious nonsense, said Dr. Daniel Kopans of Boston's Mass General. It is time to stop blaming mammography screening for 'overdiagnosis' and 'overtreatment' in an effort to deny women access to screening.","completion":"A recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine revealed that 1.3 million women have been incorrectly diagnosed with breast cancer after undergoing mammograms over the past three decades.

The study has triggered mixed reactions from experts on the issue, with some arguing that it sheds light on the need to re-evaluate the value of mammography, while others claimed that it is not right to blame mammography screening for overtreatment and overdiagnosis."},{"prompt":"just found out that my stepson ( Josh 's ) brother was in a tragic accident .

Calculate the dot product of the two vectors. Plug your results into the formula. Find the angle based on the cosine.","completion":"Calculating the angle between two vectors can be crucial in many mathematical and physical applications. To determine this angle, you will need to first identify the vectors, write down the cosine formula, calculate the length of each vector, and then calculate the dot product of the two vectors before plugging your results into the formula. To begin, identify the two vectors in question. Let us call them vector A and vector B. Next, write down the cosine formula which states that the cosine of the angle between two vectors equals the dot product of the vectors divided by the product of their magnitudes. This can be expressed as cosθ = (A•B)/(|A||B|) where θ is the angle between vector A and vector B. To calculate the length of each vector, you can use the Pythagorean theorem. For example, if vector A has components (3, 4), then the length of vector A can be found by taking the square root of (3² + 4²) which is 5. Similarly, if vector B has components (-2, 5), then the length of vector B is the square root of (-2² + 5²) which is approximately 5.39. Next, calculate the dot product of vector A and vector B by multiplying their corresponding components and adding the products together. In this case, (3*-2) + (4*5) = 14. Therefore, the dot product of vector A and vector B is 14. Plug these results into the cosine formula, which will give you cosθ = 14/(5*5.39) = 0.518. To find the angle between the two vectors, you can use the inverse cosine function. cos⁻¹(0.518) is approximately 59.13 degrees, so the angle between vector A and vector B is 59.13 degrees. In conclusion, determining the angle between two vectors involves identifying the vectors, calculating their length, computing their dot product, and finally plugging the results into the cosine formula. This can be a helpful tool in a wide range of mathematical and physical problems."},{"prompt":"f A man wearing a sailor hat looks intently at the sand on the shore as the water recedes., does it logically follow that A man is reading a newspaper on a boat.?

In terms of the size of each group, it can vary by location and demographic, making it difficult to provide a straightforward answer. A household consists of one or more people who occupy a housing unit, such as a house, apartment, or mobile home. It may include a single person, a family or multiple families living under the same roof. On the other hand, a family is a group of two or more people who are related by blood, marriage or adoption and who reside in the same household. This includes married couples, parents and children, grandparents, and siblings. While households and families may seem interchangeable, they have a different purpose in understanding the population. Households are used as a measure of housing units, while families measure the structure of relationships between people. This means that a household can include a single person, unrelated roommates, or multiple families living together, whereas a family must have a specific set of relationships. In terms of which group is larger, it depends on the location and demographic being measured. For example, in areas with a high number of individuals living alone or in shared housing, households may outnumber families. However, in areas with larger families or extended families living together, families may outnumber households. Thus, it is important to understand the distinction between households and families and their purposes in measuring the population.

Give someone a hug if they just had some bad news. Exercise caution with workplace hugs. Exercise caution when hugging the opposite sex at work.","completion":"Workplace Culture and the Caution of Hugging Workplace culture is an essential aspect of any business. It sets the tone for how employees interact and work with each other. Celebrating good news and comforting someone during difficult times are significant components of workplace culture. A simple hug can be a great way to show support for your colleagues, but there are some caveats to be aware of when it comes to hugging in the workplace. Hugging as a sign of celebration or comfort is acceptable in many work environments. A hug communicates warmth, compassion, and empathy. When someone shares great news, such as the birth of a child or a big promotion, a hug can be an excellent way to share in their joy. Similarly, a hug can be a reassuring gesture when someone is going through a tough time or experiencing sadness. However, it's essential to exercise caution when hugging at work. Not everyone is comfortable with physical contact, and some people may perceive hugs as inappropriate or too intimate. Therefore, it's always advisable to ask someone if they're okay with a hug, rather than assuming they are. If you're unsure about a person's feelings in this regard, a handshake or a high-five can be just as effective in communicating your support. It's also important to exercise caution when hugging someone of the opposite sex in the workplace. Unfortunately, the world is not always a safe or fair place, and misinterpretation can happen. Therefore, it's best to be cautious about hugging colleagues of the opposite sex at work, especially if you don't know them well. Also, be sure to read their body language for signs of discomfort, which may indicate that they prefer not to be hugged. In conclusion, hugs have their place in workplace culture as a sign of celebration and support, but it's necessary to approach hugging with caution. Always respect the boundaries of your colleagues and ask for their consent before hugging. Additionally, it's advisable to exercise caution when hugging colleagues of the opposite sex at work, and be aware of their comfort levels. When it comes to physical contact in the workplace, it's better to err on the side of caution to ensure a safe and respectful work culture."},{"prompt":"This has led to public discussions if Greece, Portugal, and even Italy would be better off leaving the eurozone to regain economical and financial stability if they would not implement reforms to strengthen their competitiveness as part of the eurozone in time.

Meanwhile, the average family size is slightly smaller at 2.52 people. This means that the group for households that is larger is the average household size. It is important to note that there is a distinction between these two terms. Household size refers to the total number of individuals who live in the same residence, regardless of their relationship to one another. Family size, on the other hand, refers specifically to the number of individuals related by blood, marriage, or adoption who live in the same household. While the difference between the two may seem small, it is significant from a demographic perspective. The fact that the average household size is slightly larger than the average family size suggests that there are more households that include non-family members, such as roommates or unmarried couples. Additionally, the data shows that household and family sizes can vary widely depending on a number of factors, including age, income, and geographic location. For example, households in urban areas tend to be smaller than those in rural areas, while households headed by older adults tend to be smaller than those headed by younger adults.

The region's geology developed from river deposits formed from the erosion of the Rocky Mountains. These sediments consist of a series of sands and clays deposited on decaying organic marine matter, that over time, transformed into oil and natural gas. Beneath the layers of sediment is a waterdeposited layer of halite, a rock salt. The porous layers were compressed over time and forced upward. As it pushed upward, the salt dragged surrounding sediments into salt dome formations, often trapping oil and gas that seeped from the surrounding porous sands.

However, it can also be intimidating for beginners. If you're just starting out, it's important to build your skills and confidence with some simple techniques. One way to do this is by practicing with scrap wood. Before you begin carving, it's essential to ensure you are holding the knife correctly. Avoid holding the knife like a pencil, which can result in a lack of control and increase the risk of injury. Instead, hold the knife in a firm grip with your thumb on the back of the blade, providing better control and leverage. When carving, it's important to follow the direction of the wood grain. This will not only make your work easier but will also ensure you don't damage the wood or your tools. Carve gently and steadily, using small, precise cuts to remove material gradually. Start by practicing a few basic cuts before moving on to more complex techniques. A straight cut involves pulling the knife directly towards you, while a push cut involves pushing the knife away from you. Other cuts include the stop cut, which creates a crisp, clean edge by slicing into the wood at a 90-degree angle, and the V-cut, which is used to create grooves or texture in the wood. By practicing with scrap wood and following these basic tips, you'll be well on your way to mastering the art of wood carving. Remember always to work carefully and cautiously, using sharp tools and carving along the grain to avoid damaging the wood or hurting yourself. With practice, patience, and dedication, you'll soon be creating beautiful, unique pieces of art that you can be proud of."},{"prompt":"Except for a nice little nap , a shortish reading break , and some not too elaborate dinner preparations , I spent the entire day in the Sweat Shop .

She read several, likes some, but is sticking with Dr. Spock's advice: Go with my gut","completion":"New Mom Katie Walmsley Trusts Her Instincts Over Parenting Books When it comes to parenting, new mom Katie Walmsley admitted feeling the pressure to follow different ideas and strategies provided by numerous books. She found herself wondering which one was the right book and whether she even needed a book at all. Walmsley didn't want to follow a set of rules dictated by a book, but rather wanted to trust her own instincts when it comes to raising her child. Walmsley's approach is noteworthy. While there are countless books out there with well-intentioned advice, not all of them will fit every parent’s style or their child’s unique needs. It can be daunting trying to find the “right” book to guide you through the ups and downs of parenthood. After reading several books, Walmsley found that she liked some but didn’t fully connect with the ideas presented. Eventually, she turned to Dr. Spock's advice and decided to go with her gut. This is a powerful lesson for all new parents – trust your instincts. Walmsley’s approach doesn’t mean she’ll never reference a parenting book again. She willingly uses them as a resource to gain insight or new perspectives, but she doesn’t feel the pressure to follow every guideline presented. As a parent, you don't always have to follow what books say because every child is different. Ultimately, you know your child best and you should trust that you will make the right decisions when it comes to their care. In conclusion, Walmsley’s approach to parenting may seem unconventional to some, but it is a reminder that trusting your instincts is key. Parenting books can provide helpful tips and tricks, but it is important to remember that every child and family is unique. Each parent needs to experiment and find what works best for them and their child."},{"prompt":"ere is some data: Belgium LEADER_NAME Charles Michel; Belgium LEADER_NAME Philippe of Belgium; Antwerp International Airport CITY_SERVED Antwerp; Belgium LANGUAGE French language; Antwerp COUNTRY Belgium.

Larger value capacitors usually use a metal foil or metal film layer deposited on the surface of a dielectric film to make the plates, and a dielectric film of impregnated paper or plastic – these are rolled up to save space. To reduce the series resistance and inductance for long plates, the plates and dielectric are staggered so that connection is made at the common edge of the rolledup plates, not at the ends of the foil or metalized film strips that comprise the plates.

To get started, purchase cheese-making cultures and rennet. The cultures will provide the bacteria necessary for creating flavor and texture, while the rennet will cause the milk to coagulate and form curds. Next, heat your milk in a non-reactive pan and add the bacterial culture. Cover and let sit at room temperature for several hours, allowing the bacteria to create lactic acid and develop the flavor of the cheese. After the culture has had time to work, warm the milk again and add the rennet. Cover and let sit for 4-12 hours, or until the milk has completely formed into curds and whey. Once the curds have formed, drain some of the whey and cut the curds into cubes. Heat the curds gently to encourage more separation of the whey, then transfer the curds into a mold and press them to remove any remaining liquid. From here, the cheese can age for several days or be eaten fresh. There are endless varieties of cheese to make at home, each with its unique flavor profile and method of production.

Many industrialized countries offer flat fees for prenatal care and delivery, but in America, there is a separate charge for everything from a blood test to removing the placenta. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"The cost of giving birth in America is shockingly high compared to other industrialized countries. According to recent data, the average cost for a hospital delivery in America is 9,775, which is significantly more than other countries. For instance, in France, it costs only 3,541 to deliver a baby, and in the UK, the cost is just 2,641. In many other countries, including Canada and Australia, expecting mothers are provided with free or subsidized healthcare services during pregnancy and birth. However, in America, healthcare services related to prenatal care and delivery are usually billed separately. This may include costs for tests, medications, doctor visits, or surgeries. The unfortunate result is often a large medical bill that can be a financial burden for many families. It is not surprising that many Americans are struggling to afford childbirth. The high maternal mortality rate in America has been linked to financial barriers to healthcare access. Women who cannot afford prenatal care are more likely to experience complications during childbirth, leading to maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. There are various reasons why the cost of childbirth is so high in America. One significant factor is that the health insurance system in America is fragmented, and people who lack insurance coverage face exorbitant medical bills. Additionally, medical facilities in America are often owned by private corporations that seek to maximize their profits. This means that prices for medical services, including childbirth, are often inflated, making it difficult for average Americans to afford medical care. In conclusion, the cost of childbirth in America is outrageously high compared to other countries. The lack of affordable healthcare services for mothers and their babies contributes to a higher maternal mortality rate and places financial pressure on families. It is essential that policymakers address these issues to ensure healthcare is accessible to all Americans, regardless of their financial status."},{"prompt":"Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? the bai brothers have taken an small slice of history and opened it up for all of us to understand , OPTIONS: negative positive","completion":"positive"},{"prompt":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","completion":"Context: In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of people transitioning to a vegan lifestyle.

One of the most effective ways to do this is by physically visiting the company's brick and mortar location. This provides an opportunity to meet with representatives of the company, ask questions and observe the general operations of the business. During your visit, it is important to check the registration data of the company. This can be done by researching whether the business has officially registered with local, state or federal authorities. This information can usually be found online through government websites or by contacting the appropriate agency directly. If the company is not registered, this may be a red flag and a cause for concern. Another useful resource in determining the legitimacy of a company is the Better Business Bureau (BBB). The BBB provides information about the company's history, ratings, and customer complaints. This information can be accessed online or by contacting the nearest BBB office. The BBB is a reliable source of information and can help you make an informed decision about whether to do business with a particular company. Industry organizations can also be helpful in determining the legitimacy of a company. Industry-specific organizations often have membership requirements that require companies to meet certain standards and adhere to specific ethical guidelines. By checking a company's membership with such organizations, you can determine whether they meet industry standards and if they have a good reputation within their industry. Lastly, a company credit report can also be a valuable tool in checking the legitimacy of a company. This report will provide information about the company's financial history, including any bankruptcies, liens, or judgments against the company. This type of information can be obtained through credit reporting agencies or business credit reporting services. In summary, taking the necessary steps to ensure the legitimacy of a company before doing business with them is essential. By physically visiting the company's brick and mortar location, checking registration data, utilizing the Better Business Bureau, using industry organizations, and obtaining a company credit report, you can make an informed decision and avoid potentially fraudulent or unethical business practices."},{"prompt":"Data: name = The Golden Curry, eatType = restaurant, food = English, priceRange = high, familyFriendly = yes, near = The Bakers.

Don’t feel like you need to dwell on the topic. Know that there will be people who aren’t okay with your stigma. Let go of what you can’t control. Walk away if you must.","completion":"As individuals, we all have certain stigmas attached to us which could range from physical appearances to mental health issues. While these stigmas might not necessarily define us, they tend to create a certain perception in other people's minds which can be difficult to deal with. It is important to understand that stigmas are normalized in society, and it is not your fault that you have to deal with them. However, it is essential to learn how to cope with them and move forward. The first step towards dealing with the stigma is to ask others for help. You need to open up about the subject, and let people know how you feel. Talking about it could help you feel better, and it can be therapeutic in some cases. Sometimes, it is essential to take assistance from the people around you to be able to cope with these stigmas. Using the \\"support others\\" coping technique can also prove to be very beneficial. Being there for someone else who is dealing with the same or similar issues can help you cope better with your own struggles. By supporting others, you can develop a sense of community, and you'll feel less alone in your journey. It's important not to use avoidant and comfort zone techniques when dealing with stigmas. Avoiding people, situations or feelings could lead to more problems down the line. It is crucial to be open, about those feelings, and talk to someone about them. Staying in your comfort zone will stop you from experiencing new things resulting in a lack of progress. Humor is another essential tool when dealing with stigmas. Believe it or not, humor can act as a coping mechanism if used intelligently. It can help you break down barriers and have better conversations about stigmas. A well-placed joke can go a long way in breaking the ice. It is crucial to find a balance when dealing with stigmas. While it is important to talk about them and open up to people, you don't need to dwell on them. Try to shift your focus to more positive things in your life, and don't let the stigma define you. It's also important to realize that there will be people who are not okay with your stigma, and you must learn to let go of that which you cannot control. Not everyone has to approve of you, and their opinions do not define you. Lastly, if someone's remarks or behavior towards you becomes too difficult to bear, you need to walk away. Protecting your mental health is just as important as dealing with stigmas. It is essential to understand that you do not have to put up with someone's negative energy, and you have the right to walk away. In conclusion, everyone faces stigmas at some point in their lives. It is necessary to ask for help, use the \\"support others\\" coping technique, avoid comfort zones, use humor, don't dwell, let go of uncontrollable factors, and if needed walk away. Coping with stigmas can be challenging, and everyone's journey is unique. However, with the right mindset and tools, it is possible to overcome them and thrive."},{"prompt":"The story would never win awards, but that's not what it's about... the script was just entertaining and suspenseful enough to make room for the incredibly choreographed fight scenes.

Fortunately, there are a number of natural ways to relax your mind and body, including drinking water, practicing deep breathing, getting regular massages, using hot tubs and saunas, and considering acupuncture. First and foremost, regular hydration is crucial to maintaining good health. Drinking water not only helps your body function properly, but it can also reduce stress levels. Aim to drink at least eight glasses of water per day to stay hydrated and help flush toxins from your body. Deep breathing is another technique that can help calm your mind and reduce stress. Try inhaling deeply for five counts, holding your breath for seven counts, and exhaling slowly for eight counts. Repeat this pattern several times, and you may soon start to feel more relaxed and centered. For those who carry tension in their muscles or suffer from chronic pain, regular massages can be an excellent way to improve circulation and promote overall relaxation. Be sure to find a trained professional who can target the areas where you need the most relief. Saunas and hot tubs can also provide a great way to unwind and relax tense muscles. These heat therapies promote relaxation, relieve pain, and can even improve sleep quality. Just ensure you drink plenty of water before, during, and after the treatments to stay hydrated.

This is particularly true for games that are designed to be harder, such as platformers or puzzle games. By introducing more complex patterns, players are forced to think creatively and use their problem-solving skills to overcome challenges. There are a few different ways that game developers can create more complicated patterns. One approach is to introduce more obstacles that must be navigated through in order to progress through the game. This could mean adding in more enemies, or making platforms more difficult to jump between. Another approach is to introduce new mechanics or rules that require players to think differently about how they approach each level. For example, a puzzle game might introduce a new type of block that can only be moved a certain way. One of the benefits of using more complicated patterns in games is that it can keep players engaged for longer periods of time. When a game is too easy, players may quickly get bored or lose interest. By adding in more complex patterns, players are challenged to use their critical thinking skills and problem-solving abilities to overcome obstacles. This can create a greater sense of accomplishment and satisfaction when they finally succeed. However, it's important to strike the right balance when creating more complicated patterns. If a game is too difficult, it can quickly become frustrating and players may give up altogether. Developers need to carefully consider the difficulty level of their games and make sure that they are challenging without being overly frustrating. In conclusion, creating more complicated patterns can be an effective way to increase the level of challenge in games. This can help keep players engaged for longer periods of time and create a greater sense of accomplishment when they finally succeed.

The MagnetoSperm can move along at up to 0.5 body lengths per second, while a human sperm can cover several times its body length in that time.","completion":"MagnetoSperm: A Revolutionary Microrobot Scientists have been experimenting with microrobots for decades, looking for ways to use them in medicine and biological research. Recently, a group of researchers has created an innovative microrobot called MagnetoSperm, which has the potential to revolutionize the field. MagnetoSperm is a tiny robot with a metal-coated head, designed to resemble a sperm. However, it is six times longer than human sperm. This unique shape allows the robot to travel through the human body and reach areas that traditional robots cannot. The most remarkable feature of MagnetoSperm is its ability to move through a magnetic field. Due to its metal coating, the robot is pushed in various directions within a magnetic field. This ability to navigate through a magnetic field opens up new possibilities for medical applications, such as targeted drug delivery to a specific area of the body. Scientists were able to steer MagnetoSperm by directing the magnetic field lines. This discovery means that the robot can be precisely directed to a particular target location within the human body. This unprecedented level of accuracy can lead to more effective medical procedures and safer surgeries. Despite its innovative design and unique capabilities, MagnetoSperm is slower than human sperm. While human sperm can move several times its body length in a second, MagnetoSperm can only move up to 0.5 body lengths per second. However, this drawback does not diminish the potential of MagnetoSperm. The robot's ability to navigate through a magnetic field opens doors to new medical procedures and research possibilities. In conclusion, MagnetoSperm is a groundbreaking creation that has the potential to lead to new medical applications and procedures. The microrobot's ability to navigate through a magnetic field will pave the way for new research in medical robotics. With further development, MagnetoSperm could become a vital tool in the medical field."},{"prompt":"Generate a positive review for a place.","completion":"This place exceeded my expectations in every way possible!

Apply the colorant to the filler. Cover the area with leather sealant.","completion":"If you have a tear in your leather car seat or furniture, it can be frustrating to see it every time you use it. However, with the right tools and method, a tear can be repaired easily and quickly. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to repair a tear in your leather car seat or furniture. 1. Choose a repair kit with colorant that matches the leather. It's essential to get a kit that matches the color of your leather so that the repair won't be noticeable. 2. Clean the seat. Use a leather cleaner to remove any dirt or debris from the tear and the surrounding area. Allow it to dry completely before proceeding to the next step. 3. Trim any ragged edges around the tear. If there are any loose or frayed edges, use a pair of scissors to trim them away. This step will help the repair look more professional. 4. Glue the canvas backing cloth underneath the tear. Most repair kits come with a cloth backing that needs to be glued underneath the tear. Apply glue to the cloth and press it onto the underside of the tear. 5. Build up layers of leather filler. The filler is a putty-like substance that you apply to the tear to fill in the gap. Apply it in thin layers, allowing each layer to dry before adding another. 6. Sand down the filler. Once the filler has dried, use sandpaper to smooth it out until it's level with the surrounding leather. 7. Wipe down the seat with a damp cloth. Use a damp cloth to remove any dust or debris left over from the sanding process. 8. Apply the colorant to the filler. The colorant is applied in thin coats until it matches the color of the surrounding leather. Allow each coat to dry before adding another. 9. Cover the area with leather sealant. Once the colorant has dried, apply a coat of leather sealant to protect the repair from future damage. In conclusion, repairing a tear in your leather car seat or furniture is a relatively simple process. By following these steps, you can quickly and easily repair your leather and restore its original beauty."},{"prompt":"1.
