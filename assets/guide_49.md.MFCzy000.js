Sew the cuffs. Trim off any loose or hanging threads.

Cuffs are a practical way of finishing hemlines, and they add a nice touch to any garment, especially pants. To sew cuffs on pants, start by folding the hemline up towards the wrong side of the fabric. Make sure the hemline is folded evenly around the entire leg circumference. Use an iron to press the folded cuff gently, making sure the crease is crisp and neat. Next, sew the cuffs in place using a straight stitch. Sew along the top edge of the folded cuff, about 1/8 inch from the edge. Use thread that matches the color of the pants, and be sure to backstitch at the beginning and end of the seam to strengthen it. After sewing the cuffs, trim off any excess threads or loose fabric. The last thing you want is for your pants to unravel. Use a sharp pair of scissors to carefully cut the threads as close to the seam as possible. Make sure you don't accidentally cut into the fabric. Finally, turn the pants right-side-out, and admire your finished product! Your pants are now ready to wear with their newly sewn cuffs.

Crush up some Vitamin C tablets into a powder and mix them with shampoo or water to make a paste. Apply this paste to your hair and let it sit for 30-60 minutes before rinsing it out. The citric acid in Vitamin C helps to break down the melanin in your hair, resulting in a lighter shade. If you prefer to use a product specifically designed for hair lightening, there are many options available. Choose a product that is free of harsh chemicals and contains natural ingredients like chamomile, lemon juice, or honey. Before using any hair lightening product, make sure to do a patch test to check for any allergic reactions. Keep in mind that hair lightening can be a gradual process, and it may take multiple applications to achieve your desired shade. Additionally, over-lightening your hair can cause damage and breakage, so be sure to take care of your hair with regular deep conditioning treatments.

Innovations in statistical analysis by Ronald Fisher, Frank Yates and others at Rothamsted Experimental Station facilitated rational experimental design and data analysis in botanical research. The discovery and identification of the auxin plant hormones by Kenneth V. Thimann in 1948 enabled regulation of plant growth by externally applied chemicals. Frederick Campion Steward pioneered techniques of micropropagation and plant tissue culture controlled by plant hormones.

Winter storm could shut down transportation and make for freezing, miserable spectators. But if the game is a success, more coldweather markets may host Super Bowls. Fans like to take over host cities, so Politi wonders if NYC will swallow the game whole","completion":"On Sunday, February 3, 2013, the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans experienced a power outage during the Super Bowl XLVII, causing a delay of 34 minutes in the game. This incident may have set the stage for the next year's Super Bowl in New Jersey, according to Steve Politi of the Star-Ledger. Politi pointed out that the upcoming Super Bowl in New Jersey could face a bigger challenge than just a power outage. The harsh winter weather could shut down transportation and make the spectators' experience miserable. However, if the game is a success, it may open up opportunities for more cold-weather markets to host Super Bowls. The Super Bowl is more than just a football game, it's also a cultural event that attracts fans from all over the country. Fans like to take over the host cities, going to concerts, attending parties, and turning the area into one big celebration. Politi wonders if New York City will \\"swallow the game whole\\" and provide the perfect backdrop for the Super Bowl. However, hosting the Super Bowl in cold-weather cities is not a new concept. The idea has been floated around for years, and the NFL has been supportive of it. The 2014 Super Bowl in New Jersey is expected to draw a lot of attention and force the league to evaluate the viability of other cold-weather cities as future hosts. In conclusion, the power outage at the Superdome during the Super Bowl XLVII may have set the groundwork for the next year's Super Bowl in New Jersey. While hosting the game in a cold-weather city poses challenges, it also presents opportunities for other cities to be considered as future hosts. Regardless of the location or weather, the Super Bowl remains a highly anticipated event that brings together football fans from all around the country."},{"prompt":"Answer the question about text: What a great week .

They come in two types: hot cathode and cold cathode. In the hot cathode version an electrically heated filament produces an electron beam. The electrons travel through the gauge and ionize gas molecules around them. The resulting ions are collected at a negative electrode. The current depends on the number of ions, which depends on the pressure in the gauge. Hot cathode gauges are accurate from 10−3 torr to 10−10 torr. The principle behind cold cathode version is the same, except that electrons are produced in a discharge created by a high voltage electrical discharge. Cold cathode gauges are accurate from 10−2 torr to 10−9 torr. Ionization gauge calibration is very sensitive to construction geometry, chemical composition of gases being measured, corrosion and surface deposits. Their calibration can be invalidated by activation at atmospheric pressure or low vacuum.

This means that the 45 to 64 age group is about 19 million people larger than the 25 to 44 age group. The reasons for this difference in age group size are complex and are influenced by factors such as birth rates, mortality rates, migration trends, and societal changes. The aging of the Baby Boom generation, which includes individuals born between 1946 and 1964, is one factor that has contributed to the growth of the 45 to 64 age group. As this generation has aged, they have contributed to the overall increase in the number of older adults in the U.S. Additionally, improvements in healthcare and medical technology have led to increased lifespan for individuals, which has further contributed to the growth of the 45 to 64 age group. Similarly, changes in lifestyle, including a decrease in birth rates, have led to a smaller population of individuals in the 25 to 44 age group. In conclusion, based on the United States Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program from 2019, the 45 to 64 age group is larger than the 25 to 44 age group. This disparity can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the aging of the Baby Boom generation and improvements in healthcare and medical technology."},{"prompt":"Write a sentence about the following things: laboratory, scientist, work","completion":"The scientist works in the laboratory."},{"prompt":"Tiny Drives With Big Brains It's hard to resist these increasingly handy devices.

Depending on where you live, there may be zoning laws, building codes, or other regulations that need to be followed. Once you've determined the legal requirements, it's time to focus on the irrigation system. Dividing your garden into watering zones is a smart way to ensure that each area receives the appropriate amount of water. To begin, assess the size and layout of your garden. Consider the types of plants you'll be growing, as well as their watering needs. This information will help you determine how many watering zones you'll need and how much water each zone will require. Next, install an irrigation system that includes separate valves for each watering zone. This will allow you to control the flow of water to each area independently. When setting up your irrigation system, be sure to strategically place sprinkler heads and drip irrigation lines to ensure the most efficient water usage. For example, water-spraying heads for lawns and garden beds will differ from drip lines for potted plants. In addition to creating an efficient watering system, dividing your garden into watering zones can also help prevent water waste and plant diseases. By providing the right amount of water to each area, you can avoid over-watering or under-watering, which can lead to issues like root rot, fungus, or insect infestation. Overall, taking the time to check legal requirements and divide your garden into watering zones can make a significant difference in the health and growth of your plants. With a properly planned irrigation system in place, you'll have a thriving garden that's both beautiful and sustainable."},{"prompt":"Which phone should I buy in India?

They move much more slowly than a mountain stream. These slow moving streams create different types of features than mountain streams. Slow moving water erodes the sides of their channels more than the bottom. Also, large curves in the stream form. These curves are called meanders. Meanders are caused by erosion and deposition. Remember, faster moving water causes erosion more quickly. Slower moving water erodes material more slowly. If water is moving slowly enough, the sediment being carried may settle out. This settling out, or dropping off, of sediment is deposition. The curves are called meanders because they slowly wander over the land. As meanders erode from side to side, they create a floodplain.

Store cut avocados to preserve freshness. Freeze avocado to avoid waste.","completion":"Avocados are a beloved fruit, prized for their delicious taste and health benefits. However, they can be tricky to store and prevent from overripening. Luckily, there are simple ways to store avocados to avoid waste and maintain their freshness. Firstly, to avoid overripe avocados, it is essential to store them correctly. Unripe avocados should be stored at room temperature until they are fully ripe. Once they reach their desired ripeness, they can be stored in the refrigerator to slow down the ripening process. However, if you have a partially ripe avocado that you want to keep for a few days, it is best to keep it at room temperature until it fully ripens before refrigerating. Secondly, if you have already cut your avocado, it is important to store it properly to prevent it from turning brown and losing its freshness. To preserve the freshness of a cut avocado, you can store the unused portion by wrapping it tightly in plastic wrap, making sure to press the wrap tightly against the avocado’s surface to prevent any air from getting in. Another option is to store the avocado cut side down in a shallow dish and place plastic wrap over the top. This will help to keep the avocado fresh by limiting its exposure to air. Lastly, if you have excess avocados that are getting too ripe and you aren't able to eat them in time, don't throw them out – freeze them! Freezing avocados is an excellent way to prevent waste and have fresh avocado on hand for smoothies, guacamole or other avocado recipes. To freeze an avocado, cut it in half and remove the pit. Then, scoop the flesh out of the skin and place it into a zip-lock freezer bag. Squeeze out any excess air, seal it, and place it into the freezer. When you're ready to use it, simply defrost it in the refrigerator overnight, and it will be ready to use. In conclusion, taking the time to store avocados properly is essential to maintain their freshness and prevent waste. By following these simple tips, you can ensure that your avocados stay fresh and delicious for longer."},{"prompt":"w would one describe the sentiment of this tweet? @mileycyrus please come to Brazil in your tour, Brazil loves you OPTIONS: negative positive","completion":"positive"},{"prompt":"ere are some concepts: fly, ground, specie What is a sentence about these concepts?","completion":"Flying is a common trait among many species, who spend most of their time in the air and only come to ground for resting or nesting."},{"prompt":"Write a dialog based on this summary: Kelly will buy dark chocolate for her mother..","completion":"Person 1: \\"Hi Kelly, what brings you here today?\\" Kelly: \\"I need to buy some dark chocolate for my mother.

Doherty was among several embassy staff who were on a State Department-led intelligence mission to find and destroy missiles that had been looted during the Libyan uprising. The mission was part of an effort to secure weapons that could be used for terrorist attacks against U.S. interests in the region. Doherty had been working as a security contractor in Libya since the onset of the revolution in 2011. During the attack, Doherty and Ambassador Chris Stevens were killed by a group of armed militants who stormed the consulate. The exact circumstances surrounding their deaths remain unclear, but it appears that they were specifically targeted by the attackers. Doherty's death has been met with widespread sadness and disbelief. He was described by his colleagues as a loyal and dedicated professional who took great pride in his work. He was also known for his sense of humor and his ability to lighten the mood in difficult situations. Doherty's death has highlighted the dangers faced by American diplomats and military personnel in the Middle East. It has also raised questions about the effectiveness of U.S. security measures in the region. The incident has prompted a flurry of political activity in Washington, with lawmakers from both sides of the aisle calling for an investigation into the attack. Some have criticized the Obama administration's handling of the situation, while others have argued that the incident underscores the need for greater U.S. engagement in the region. Despite the tragic loss of life, many in the intelligence community believe that the mission undertaken by Doherty and his colleagues was a critical one. The fact that they were willing to risk their lives to protect U.S. interests abroad is a testament to their bravery and dedication. Doherty's legacy will undoubtedly be felt in the intelligence and security communities for years to come. His sacrifice serves as a reminder of the dangers faced by those who work to defend American interests abroad, and of the importance of supporting those who serve our country overseas."},{"prompt":"Math problem: Solve 3*h = 171 162 for h.

Since then, they have suffered from strong competition from specialist stores. Most recently the competition has intensified with the advent of largerscale superstores (Jones et al. 1994; Merrilees and Miller 1997). Competition was not the only reason for the department stores' weakening strength; the changing structure of cities also affected them. The compact and centralized 19th century city with its mass transit lines converging on the downtown was a perfect environment for department store growth. But as residents moved out of the downtown areas to the suburbs, the large, downtown department stores became inconvenient and lost business to the newer suburban shopping malls.

A person with active but untreated tuberculosis may infect 10–15 (or more) other people per year.

The probability of transmission from one person to another depends upon several factors, including the number of infectious droplets expelled by the carrier, the effectiveness of ventilation, the duration of exposure, the virulence of the M. tuberculosis strain, the level of immunity in the uninfected person, and others. The cascade of persontoperson spread can be circumvented by segregating those with active (overt) TB and putting them on antiTB drug regimens. After about two weeks of effective treatment, subjects with nonresistant active infections generally do not remain contagious to others.

Contact lens solution helps to clean, rinse, and disinfect your lenses. OPTIONS: Dispose of your contact lenses by the recommended date. Most lenses fall into one of three categories: dispose daily, dispose semiweekly, or dispose monthly. This works to remove debris, residue, and paper adhesion from lenses, and so on. If you want to get your lenses professionally cleaned, particularly if you're using disposable lenses, a professional lens cleaning kit is a fantastic alternative. Never put contact lenses in the tap or water bowl because the solution can contain chemicals that could ruin them. Always wear disposable lenses at night. Wash your lenses and lens solution and wipe off any debris before storing. Never fill lenses with a solution of ammonia, hydrogen peroxide, and other chemicals.","completion":"Dispose of your contact lenses by the recommended date.

Wind is now at the Republicans' backs, and they may be able to put brakes on health bill. Scott Brown's win gives GOP another case study in how to run successful campaign. For President Obama, loss will likely force him to reconsider his legislative priorities. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"In the aftermath of Scott Brown's stunning victory in the Massachusetts special election, many Democrats are coming to grips with the fact that the public is not particularly happy with their stewardship. The wind is now at the Republicans' backs, and they may be able to put the brakes on the comprehensive health care bill that has been a cornerstone of the Obama administration's domestic agenda. Brown's win gives the GOP yet another case study in how to run successful campaigns, particularly in blue states where the Republican brand has been tarnished in recent years. Brown's message of fiscal responsibility and opposition to Democratic policies resonated with voters who are increasingly skeptical of government spending and intrusion. The defeat in Massachusetts is a major setback for President Obama, who campaigned hard for Democrat Martha Coakley in the final days leading up to the election. The loss will likely force him to reconsider his legislative priorities and perhaps even his entire approach to governance and leadership. One immediate effect of Brown's victory is that the Senate will not have the 60 votes needed to break a Republican filibuster and pass the health care bill. This means that Democrats will have to scale back their ambitions for health care reform or try to push it through using a procedural maneuver known as reconciliation, which requires only a simple majority vote. But even if Democrats are successful in passing some form of health care reform, the political damage has already been done. The public is deeply divided on the issue, and many are angry at the way the process has been handled by the Obama administration and congressional leaders. The lesson for Democrats is clear: they must do a better job of listening to the concerns of the American people and working towards policies that are responsive to those concerns. The wind may be at the Republicans' backs for now, but there is still plenty of room for Democrats to regroup and refocus their efforts on winning back the trust and support of the American people."},{"prompt":"Read this and answer the question Mass incarceration in the United States disproportionately impacts African American and Latino communities. Michelle Alexander, author of The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness (2010), argues that mass incarceration is best understood as not only a system of overcrowded prisons.

Jordaan's call for tougher action comes as FIFA investigates allegations of racist abuse during the recent World Cup in Russia. While FIFA has imposed fines and other sanctions on football societies found guilty of racism, Jordaan contends that more needs to be done to hold individuals accountable for their actions. According to Jordaan, \\"individuals who engage in racist behavior should be banned from football for life.\\" He argues that such a measure will send a clear message that racism has no place in football or any other aspect of society. Jordaan's stance is supported by many who believe that more needs to be done to tackle racism in football. In recent years, there have been numerous incidents of racist abuse during matches, including the throwing of bananas at black players and the use of racial slurs. The issue of racism in football has become a major concern for FIFA and other organizations, with many calling for stronger action to address the problem.
