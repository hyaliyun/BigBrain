Relevant Theorem: Vieta's formulas, named after the French mathematician François Viète, are a set of algebraic equations that relate the coefficients of a polynomial to the sums and products of its roots. These formulas are particularly useful in solving polynomial equations and finding relationships between the roots without actually calculating the roots themselves. Consider a polynomial equation of degree n: P(x) = a_nx^n + a_(n1)x^(n1) + ... + a_1x + a_0 where a_n, a_(n1), ..., a_1, and a_0 are the coefficients of the polynomial, and x is the variable. Let r_1, r_2, ..., r_n be the roots of the polynomial, i.e., P(r_i) = 0 for i = 1, 2, ..., n. Vieta's formulas establish the following relationships between the coefficients and the roots: 1. Sum of the roots: r_1 + r_2 + ... + r_n = a_(n1) / a_n 2. Sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time: r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + ... + r_(n1)r_n = a_(n2) / a_n 3.

Relevant Theorem: The Derivative Chain Rule is a fundamental rule in calculus used to find the derivative of a composite function. A composite function is a function that is formed by combining two or more functions, where the output of one function becomes the input of another function. The Chain Rule states that if you have a composite function, say h(x) = f(g(x)), then the derivative of h(x) with respect to x, denoted as h'(x) or dh/dx, can be found by taking the derivative of the outer function f with respect to the inner function g(x), and then multiplying it by the derivative of the inner function g(x) with respect to x. Mathematically, the Chain Rule can be expressed as: h'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x) or dh/dx = (df/dg) * (dg/dx) The Chain Rule is particularly useful when dealing with complex functions that involve multiple layers of functions, as it allows us to break down the problem into simpler parts and find the derivative step by step.","completion":"1"},{"prompt":"For a simple random walk S_n with S_0=0 and P(S_nS_{n1}=1)=1/4, P(S_nS_{n1}=1)=3/4. Let M=max{S_n:ngeq 0}. What is the probability of the event {Mgeq 5}? Round the answer to the thousands decimal. Relevant Theorem: Random walk is a mathematical concept in probability theory that describes a path consisting of a series of random steps. It is a stochastic process, meaning it involves a sequence of random variables, where each variable represents a step in the walk. The random walk can occur in onedimensional, twodimensional, or even higherdimensional spaces. In a random walk, an object, often referred to as a walker, starts at an initial position and moves in a series of steps, with each step being determined by a random variable. The direction and distance of each step are typically drawn from a probability distribution, which can be uniform, Gaussian, or any other distribution depending on the problem being modeled. A simple example of a random walk is a onedimensional random walk on a number line, where a walker starts at position 0 and at each step, moves either one step to the left or one step to the right with equal probability. After a certain number of steps, the walker's position can be anywhere on the number line, and the probability of being at a particular position can be calculated. Random walks have applications in various fields, including physics, biology, economics, and computer science. They are used to model phenomena such as stock market fluctuations, diffusion processes, animal foraging behavior, and even the movement of molecules in a fluid. Random walks also play a crucial role in the development of algorithms for search and optimization problems.","completion":"0.01234567"},{"prompt":"While a person is walking, his arms swing through approximately a 45° angle in 0.5s.As a reasonable approximation, we can assume that the arm moves with constant speed during each swing. A typical arm is 70.0 cm long, measured from the shoulder joint. What is the acceleration (in metre per second squared) of a 1.0 g drop of blood in the fingertips at the bottom of the swing? Relevant Theorem: Newton's Laws of Motion, also known as Newton's Kinetics, are three fundamental principles that describe the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting upon it. These laws laid the foundation for classical mechanics and have been widely used to understand and predict the behavior of objects in motion. The three laws are as follows: 1. Newton's First Law (Law of Inertia): This law states that an object at rest will stay at rest, and an object in motion will stay in motion with a constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external force. In other words, an object will maintain its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless a force is applied to change its state. 2. Newton's Second Law (Law of Acceleration): This law states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. Mathematically, it can be expressed as F = ma, where F is the net force acting on the object, m is its mass, and a is the acceleration. This means that when a force is applied to an object, it will cause the object to accelerate in the direction of the force, and the acceleration will be greater for objects with smaller mass. 3. Newton's Third Law (Action and Reaction): This law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. In other words, when an object exerts a force on another object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite force back on the first object. This principle helps explain various phenomena, such as the recoil of a gun when fired or the propulsion of a rocket. In summary, Newton's Laws of Motion (Kinetics) provide a fundamental framework for understanding the relationship between forces and the motion of objects, which has been essential in the development of physics and engineering.","completion":"1.73"},{"prompt":"A steel rod 2.0 m long has a crosssectional area of 0.30 cm ^ 2. It is hung by one end from a support, and a 550kg milling machine is hung from its other end. Determine the stress on the rod and the resulting strain and elongation. (Unit: mm) Relevant Theorem: Young's Modulus, also known as the Elastic Modulus or Tensile Modulus, is a fundamental concept in classical mechanics that characterizes the mechanical properties of materials. It is named after the British scientist Thomas Young, who first introduced the concept in the early 19th century. Young's Modulus is a measure of the stiffness or rigidity of a material, quantifying its ability to resist deformation under an applied force or stress. It is defined as the ratio of stress (force per unit area) to strain (relative deformation) in a material when it is subjected to uniaxial tensile or compressive forces. Mathematically, Young's Modulus (E) can be expressed as: E = σ / ε where σ (sigma) represents stress, and ε (epsilon) represents strain. The unit of Young's Modulus is typically given in Pascals (Pa) or its multiples, such as GigaPascals (GPa) or MegaPascals (MPa). Different materials have different values of Young's Modulus, which depend on their atomic or molecular structure and the type of bonding between their atoms. For example, metals generally have a higher Young's Modulus than polymers, making them stiffer and more resistant to deformation. In summary, Young's Modulus is a fundamental property of materials in classical mechanics that describes their stiffness and resistance to deformation under applied forces. It is an essential parameter in the design and analysis of structures and mechanical systems, as it helps engineers predict how materials will behave under various loading conditions.","completion":"1.8"},{"prompt":"cos(pi/8) equal to (sqrt{2+sqrt{2}})/2?

These formulas are useful in calculus and other areas of mathematics for simplifying expressions and solving problems involving trigonometric functions. There are three main double angle formulas for sine, cosine, and tangent functions: 1. Sine double angle formula: sin(2θ) = 2sin(θ)cos(θ) 2. Cosine double angle formulas: cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) sin²(θ) = 2cos²(θ) 1 = 1 2sin²(θ) 3. Tangent double angle formula: tan(2θ) = (2tan(θ)) / (1 tan²(θ)) These formulas are derived from the angle sum formulas for sine and cosine functions: sin(α + β) = sin(α)cos(β) + cos(α)sin(β) cos(α + β) = cos(α)cos(β) sin(α)sin(β) By setting α = β = θ, we can obtain the double angle formulas.

The rope is stretched taut by a 20.0kg box of rocks attached at the bottom. If a point on the rope is in transverse SHM with f = 2.00 Hz, how many cycles of the wave are there in the rope’s length? Relevant Theorem: Wave speed, often denoted as v or c (for the speed of light), is a measure of how fast a wave travels through a medium or space. It is defined as the distance a wave travels per unit of time, typically expressed in units such as meters per second (m/s) or kilometers per hour (km/h). In the context of a wave, it refers to the speed at which the wave's peaks or troughs move from one point to another. Wave speed depends on the properties of the medium through which the wave is traveling and the type of wave itself. For example, sound waves travel at different speeds through air, water, and solids, while electromagnetic waves, such as light, travel at the speed of light in a vacuum. Wave speed can be calculated using the following formula: Wave speed (v) = Frequency (f) × Wavelength (λ) Where: Frequency (f) is the number of oscillations or cycles the wave completes in a given time, usually measured in Hertz (Hz). Wavelength (λ) is the distance between two consecutive points in the same phase of the wave, such as two adjacent peaks or troughs, typically measured in meters (m). By knowing the frequency and wavelength of a wave, one can determine its speed as it propagates through a medium or space.","completion":"1.81"},{"prompt":"What is lim_{x to 1} ((x 1) sin((pi)/(x 1))? Relevant Theorem: The Squeeze Theorem, also known as the Sandwich Theorem or the Pinching Theorem, is a fundamental concept in calculus that helps to determine the limit of a function when direct substitution or algebraic manipulation is not possible. The theorem states that if you have three functions, f(x), g(x), and h(x), such that f(x) ≤ g(x) ≤ h(x) for all x in a certain interval around a point 'a' (except possibly at 'a' itself), and if the limit of f(x) and h(x) as x approaches 'a' is the same value L, then the limit of g(x) as x approaches 'a' must also be L.

What is the price of the put premium with identical strike price and time until expiration, if the onemonth riskfree rate is 2% and the spot price of the underlying asset is 52? Relevant Theorem: PutCall Parity is a fundamental principle in options pricing that establishes a relationship between the price of European call options and European put options of the same class with the same strike prices and expiration dates. It is used to ensure that there are no arbitrage opportunities in the options market, meaning that it is not possible to make riskfree profits by simultaneously buying and selling the same set of options. The PutCall Parity formula is given by: C P = S K * (1 + r)^(t) Where: C = Price of the European call option P = Price of the European put option S = Current price of the underlying asset K = Strike price of the options r = Riskfree interest rate t = Time to expiration (in years) The formula shows that the difference between the call option price (C) and the put option price (P) is equal to the difference between the current price of the underlying asset (S) and the present value of the strike price (K) discounted at the riskfree interest rate (r) for the time to expiration (t). PutCall Parity is important for several reasons: 1. It helps traders and investors to identify mispriced options and exploit arbitrage opportunities. 2. It provides a theoretical basis for the pricing of options, which is essential for options traders and market makers. 3. It helps in understanding the relationship between different types of options and the underlying asset, which is crucial for effective risk management and hedging strategies. It is important to note that PutCall Parity only holds for European options, as American options can be exercised at any time before expiration, which can potentially disrupt the parity relationship.","completion":"2.92"},{"prompt":"W = {[x, y] in R^2: x >= 0 and y >= 0} a subspace of R^2? Relevant Theorem: In algebra, a linear subspace, also known as a vector subspace, is a subset of a vector space that is closed under the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication. In simpler terms, it is a smaller space within a larger vector space that still follows the rules of a vector space. A vector space is a set of vectors along with two operations, vector addition and scalar multiplication, that satisfy certain properties. These properties include commutativity, associativity, existence of an additive identity (zero vector), existence of additive inverses, distributivity of scalar multiplication over vector addition, and compatibility of scalar multiplication with scalar multiplication. A linear subspace is a subset of a vector space that also satisfies these properties. To be a linear subspace, a subset must meet the following conditions: 1. The zero vector of the larger vector space is also in the subspace. 2. If you add any two vectors in the subspace, their sum is also in the subspace. 3. If you multiply any vector in the subspace by a scalar, the resulting vector is also in the subspace. If a subset of a vector space meets these conditions, it is considered a linear subspace. Linear subspaces are important in various areas of mathematics, including linear algebra, functional analysis, and differential equations. They provide a way to study smaller, more manageable pieces of a larger vector space and can help simplify complex problems.","completion":"False"},{"prompt":"Sally is driving along a straight highway in her 1965 Mustang.

It is a type of twodimensional motion, as it involves both horizontal and vertical components. In the study of kinetics, projectile motion is analyzed to understand the behavior of objects moving under the influence of gravity. There are a few key characteristics of projectile motion: 1. The horizontal motion and vertical motion are independent of each other. This means that the horizontal velocity remains constant throughout the motion, while the vertical velocity is affected by gravity. 2. The only force acting on the object in projectile motion is gravity, which acts vertically downward. There are no other forces, such as air resistance, considered in the ideal projectile motion. 3. The trajectory of the projectile is parabolic. This means that the path followed by the projectile is in the shape of a parabola, with the highest point called the apex. 4. The time it takes for the projectile to reach its maximum height is equal to the time it takes to fall back to the same height from which it was launched. 5. The range of the projectile, which is the horizontal distance it travels, depends on the initial velocity, launch angle, and the acceleration due to gravity. To analyze projectile motion, the following equations are commonly used: 1. Horizontal motion: Displacement: x = v_x * t Velocity: v_x = constant 2. Vertical motion: Displacement: y = v_y * t 0.5 * g * t^2 Velocity: v_y = v_0 * sin(θ) g * t Acceleration: a_y = g In these equations, x and y represent the horizontal and vertical displacements, v_x and v_y are the horizontal and vertical velocities, t is the time, g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²), and θ is the launch angle.","completion":"517"},{"prompt":"an IPv4 datagram, the value of the totallength field is (00 mathrm{~A} 0)_{16} and the value of the headerlength (HLEN) is (5) 1_{16}. How many bytes of payload are being carried by the datagram? Relevant Theorem: Internet Protocol (IP) is a set of rules and standards that govern how data is transmitted, received, and routed across computer networks, including the internet. It is a fundamental component of the Internet Protocol Suite, which is a collection of protocols and technologies that enable communication between devices over the internet. IP operates at the network layer (Layer 3) of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model and is responsible for addressing, packaging, and routing data packets between devices. It ensures that data is sent from a source device to a destination device, even if they are on different networks. There are two main versions of IP in use today: IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) and IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6). IPv4 is the most widely used version, which uses 32bit addresses, allowing for approximately 4.3 billion unique IP addresses. Due to the rapid growth of the internet, the number of available IPv4 addresses has become limited, leading to the development of IPv6. IPv6 uses 128bit addresses, providing a vastly larger number of unique IP addresses (approximately 3.4 x 10^38) to accommodate the growing number of devices connected to the internet. Key features of Internet Protocol include: 1. Addressing: IP assigns unique addresses to devices on a network, enabling them to be identified and located. These addresses are used to route data packets to their intended destinations. 2. Packetization: IP divides data into smaller units called packets, which are then transmitted independently across the network. This allows for more efficient use of network resources and enables data to be sent over multiple paths. 3. Routing: IP uses routing algorithms to determine the best path for data packets to travel from the source device to the destination device. Routers, which are specialized devices that connect networks, use IP addresses to forward packets along the most efficient route. 4. Error detection: IP includes a checksum mechanism to detect errors in the header of data packets. If an error is detected, the packet is discarded, and the sender may be notified to resend the data. 5. Fragmentation and reassembly: IP can fragment large packets into smaller ones to accommodate the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of different networks. The destination device then reassembles the fragments back into the original data. Overall, Internet Protocol plays a crucial role in enabling communication between devices on computer networks and the internet, providing the foundation for various applications and services we use daily.","completion":"140"},{"prompt":"1985 the space shuttle Challenger flew a cesium clock and compared its time with a fixed clock left on Earth.

It was first introduced by the renowned physicist Albert Einstein in the early 20th century and consists of two parts: the Special Theory of Relativity and the General Theory of Relativity. 1. Special Theory of Relativity (1905): This theory deals with objects moving at constant speeds, particularly those moving close to the speed of light. It is based on two main principles: a. The Principle of Relativity: The laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to one another. b. The Constancy of the Speed of Light: The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of their motion or the motion of the light source. The Special Theory of Relativity led to several counterintuitive conclusions, such as time dilation (moving clocks run slower), length contraction (moving objects appear shorter), and the equivalence of mass and energy (E=mc^2), which states that mass can be converted into energy and vice versa. 2. General Theory of Relativity (1915): This theory is an extension of the Special Theory of Relativity and deals with gravity. It describes gravity not as a force between masses, as proposed by Sir Isaac Newton, but as a curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass. In other words, massive objects like planets and stars warp the fabric of spacetime, causing other objects to move along curved paths. The General Theory of Relativity has been confirmed through various experiments and observations, such as the bending of light around massive objects (gravitational lensing), the shift in the orbit of Mercury, and the detection of gravitational waves. In summary, Relativity is a groundbreaking theory that has reshaped our understanding of the universe, providing a more accurate and comprehensive description of the fundamental concepts of space, time, and gravity.","completion":"330.76"},{"prompt":"Let A be an invertible n * n matrix and v and eigenvector of both A and B, is v necesarily an eigenvector of A + B? Relevant Theorem: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are fundamental concepts in linear algebra, particularly in the study of linear transformations and matrices. They provide insight into the behavior of a linear transformation and can be used to solve various problems in mathematics, physics, and engineering. Eigenvalues: An eigenvalue (denoted by λ) is a scalar value associated with a given square matrix (A) that satisfies the following equation: A * v = λ * v where A is a square matrix, v is a nonzero vector (called the eigenvector), and λ is the eigenvalue. In other words, when a matrix A is multiplied by an eigenvector v, the result is a scaled version of the same eigenvector, with the scaling factor being the eigenvalue λ. To find the eigenvalues of a matrix, we need to solve the following equation: det(A λ * I) = 0 where det() denotes the determinant of a matrix, I is the identity matrix of the same size as A, and λ is the eigenvalue. The solutions to this equation are the eigenvalues of the matrix A. Eigenvectors: An eigenvector (denoted by v) is a nonzero vector that, when multiplied by a square matrix A, results in a scaled version of itself, with the scaling factor being the eigenvalue λ. As mentioned earlier, the relationship between a matrix A, its eigenvector v, and the corresponding eigenvalue λ can be expressed as: A * v = λ * v Eigenvectors are essential in understanding the geometric interpretation of a linear transformation represented by a matrix. They indicate the directions in which the transformation stretches or compresses the space, while the eigenvalues represent the magnitude of the stretching or compression.

Relevant Theorem: Delta Gamma Approximation, also known as the secondorder Taylor series approximation, is a method used in the field of financial derivatives to estimate the change in the value of an option or other derivative instruments due to small changes in the underlying asset's price. This approximation takes into account both the firstorder (Delta) and secondorder (Gamma) sensitivities of the option's price to the underlying asset's price. Delta is the first derivative of the option's price with respect to the underlying asset's price. It measures the sensitivity of the option's price to a small change in the underlying asset's price. In other words, Delta represents the expected change in the option's price for a 1 change in the underlying asset's price. Gamma is the second derivative of the option's price with respect to the underlying asset's price. It measures the rate of change of Delta as the underlying asset's price changes. In other words, Gamma represents the expected change in Delta for a 1 change in the underlying asset's price. The Delta Gamma Approximation is particularly useful for managing the risk associated with options and other derivative instruments, as it helps traders and risk managers to estimate the potential impact of small price movements in the underlying asset on the value of their positions.

Angular dynamics is an extension of linear dynamics, which deals with the motion of objects in a straight line. In angular dynamics, the key concepts include: 1. Angular displacement (θ): It is the angle through which an object rotates about a fixed axis or a point. It is measured in radians. 2. Angular velocity (ω): It is the rate of change of angular displacement with respect to time. It is a vector quantity and is measured in radians per second (rad/s). 3. Angular acceleration (α): It is the rate of change of angular velocity with respect to time. It is also a vector quantity and is measured in radians per second squared (rad/s²). 4. Moment of inertia (I): It is a measure of an object's resistance to change in its angular velocity. It depends on the mass distribution of the object and the axis of rotation. The moment of inertia is analogous to mass in linear dynamics. 5. Torque (τ): It is the rotational equivalent of force, which causes an object to rotate about an axis. Torque is the product of the force applied and the distance from the axis of rotation to the point where the force is applied. The fundamental equation of angular dynamics is given by Newton's second law for rotation: τ = Iα where τ is the net torque acting on the object, I is the moment of inertia, and α is the angular acceleration.

Relevant Theorem: Taylor's approximation theorem, also known as Taylor's theorem, is a fundamental concept in calculus that provides an approximation of a differentiable function near a specific point using a polynomial called the Taylor polynomial. The theorem is named after the mathematician Brook Taylor, who introduced it in the early 18th century. The Taylor polynomial is constructed using the function's derivatives at that specific point. The more terms included in the polynomial, the more accurate the approximation becomes. The Taylor polynomial of degree n for a function f(x) at a point a is given by: P_n(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(xa) + (f''(a)(xa)^2)/2! + ... + (f^n(a)(xa)^n)/n! where f'(a), f''(a), and f^n(a) represent the first, second, and nth derivatives of the function evaluated at the point a, respectively. Taylor's theorem states that if a function f(x) is (n+1) times differentiable in an interval containing the point a, then the error (or remainder) between the function and its Taylor polynomial of degree n is given by: R_n(x) = (f^(n+1)(c)(xa)^(n+1))/((n+1)!) where c is a number between a and x.

Holomorphic functions are complex functions that are differentiable at every point in their domain, and they play a central role in complex analysis.

Let f(z) be a complex function defined in a domain D, where z = x + iy is a complex variable with x and y being real numbers, and i is the imaginary unit (i.e., i^2 = 1).

The CauchyRiemann equations are given by: 1. ∂u/∂x = ∂v/∂y 2. ∂u/∂y = ∂v/∂x These equations state that the partial derivatives of u and v with respect to x and y must satisfy the above relationships for f(z) to be holomorphic in D. The CauchyRiemann Theorem can be stated as follows: A function f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) is holomorphic in a domain D if and only if the following conditions are satisfied: 1. The partial derivatives ∂u/∂x, ∂u/∂y, ∂v/∂x, and ∂v/∂y exist and are continuous in D. 2. The CauchyRiemann equations hold in D. In other words, if a complex function satisfies the CauchyRiemann equations and its partial derivatives are continuous, then the function is holomorphic in its domain. Conversely, if a function is holomorphic, it must satisfy the CauchyRiemann equations.","completion":"True"},{"prompt":"The asteroid Pallas has an orbital period of 4.62 years and an orbital eccentricity of 0.233. Find the semimajor axis of its orbit. (Unit: 10^11 m) Relevant Theorem: Kepler's Third Law, also known as the Law of Harmonies, is one of the three fundamental laws of planetary motion formulated by the German astronomer Johannes Kepler in the early 17th century. This law relates the orbital period of a planet to its average distance from the Sun, stating that the square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semimajor axis of its orbit. Mathematically, Kepler's Third Law can be expressed as: (T₁/T₂)² = (a₁/a₂)³ where T₁ and T₂ are the orbital periods of two planets, and a₁ and a₂ are the semimajor axes of their respective orbits. In simpler terms, this law implies that planets that are closer to the Sun have shorter orbital periods and move faster in their orbits, while planets that are farther away from the Sun have longer orbital periods and move slower in their orbits. This relationship holds true for all planets in our solar system and can also be applied to other celestial bodies, such as moons orbiting a planet or exoplanets orbiting a star.","completion":"4.15"},{"prompt":"there a y bewteen x and x+h such that sin(x+h) sinx = h * cos(y)? Relevant Theorem: Lagrange's theorem is a fundamental result in group theory, a branch of abstract algebra. It states that for any finite group G and any subgroup H of G, the order of H (i.e., the number of elements in H) divides the order of G (i.e., the number of elements in G). In other words, if |G| denotes the order of G and |H| denotes the order of H, then |H| divides |G|. Mathematically, Lagrange's theorem can be expressed as: |H| divides |G| or |G| = k * |H| where k is a positive integer. The theorem is named after the FrenchItalian mathematician JosephLouis Lagrange. It is a fundamental result in group theory because it provides information about the possible sizes of subgroups of a given group and has many important consequences, such as the existence of group homomorphisms, the concept of cosets, and the counting of elements with specific properties. Lagrange's theorem is based on the idea of partitioning the group G into disjoint subsets called cosets, which are formed by multiplying the elements of the subgroup H by a fixed element of G. Each coset has the same number of elements as H, and the cosets partition G without overlapping. This implies that the order of G must be a multiple of the order of H, which is the statement of Lagrange's theorem.","completion":"True"},{"prompt":"For an American perpetual option within the BlackScholes framework, you are given: (i) h_1 + h_2 = 7/9 (ii) The continuously compounded riskfree interest rate is 5%. (iii) σ = 0.30. What is the value of h_1? Relevant Theorem: The BlackScholes Model, also known as the BlackScholesMerton Model, is a mathematical model used to price options and other financial derivatives. Developed by Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Merton in the early 1970s, the model provides a theoretical framework for valuing Europeanstyle options, which can only be exercised at the expiration date. The BlackScholes Model is based on several key assumptions: 1. The underlying asset's price follows a geometric Brownian motion, meaning that its price changes are random with a constant drift and volatility. 2. The option can only be exercised at expiration. 3. There are no transaction costs or taxes. 4. The riskfree interest rate is constant and known. 5. The underlying asset does not pay dividends. 6. Investors can borrow and lend money at the riskfree interest rate. 7. The market is efficient, meaning that arbitrage opportunities do not exist. The BlackScholes Model uses these assumptions to derive a partial differential equation, known as the BlackScholes equation, which describes the dynamics of an option's price. By solving this equation, one can obtain the BlackScholes formula, which calculates the theoretical price of a European call or put option. The BlackScholes formula for a European call option is: C = S * N(d1) X * e^(rT) * N(d2) And for a European put option: P = X * e^(rT) * N(d2) S * N(d1) Where: C is the price of the call option P is the price of the put option S is the current price of the underlying asset X is the option's strike price T is the time until the option's expiration r is the riskfree interest rate N(x) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution e is the base of the natural logarithm d1 and d2 are intermediate variables calculated as follows: d1 = (ln(S/X) + (r + (σ^2)/2) * T) / (σ * sqrt(T)) d2 = d1 σ * sqrt(T) Where: ln(x) is the natural logarithm of x σ is the volatility of the underlying asset's returns The BlackScholes Model has been widely used in the financial industry for pricing options and has earned its creators the 1997 Nobel Prize in Economics. However, it has some limitations, such as its assumptions of constant volatility and no dividends, which may not hold true in realworld scenarios. Despite these limitations, the model remains a fundamental tool in the field of financial derivatives.","completion":"1.51"},{"prompt":"Find the volume of a solid bounded by the elliptical paraboloid z=2x^2 + y^2 + 1, the plane x+y=1, and the coordinate planes.

It is typically expressed in cubic units, such as cubic centimeters (cm³), cubic meters (m³), or cubic inches (in³). Volume is an important concept in various fields, including science, engineering, and mathematics. Calculating the volume of an object depends on its shape. For example, the volume of a rectangular prism can be calculated by multiplying its length, width, and height (V = lwh), while the volume of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula V = πr²h, where r is the radius of the base and h is the height. In general, the volume of an object can be found by integrating the area of its crosssections along a particular axis or by using specific formulas for different shapes.","completion":"0.75"},{"prompt":"Suppose there are 100 identical firms in a perfectly competitive industry. Each firm has a shortrun total cost function of the form C(q) = rac{1}{300}q^3 + 0.2q^2 + 4q + 10. Suppose market demand is given by Q = 200P + 8,000. What will be the shortrun equilibrium price? Relevant Theorem: Shortrun equilibrium in economics refers to a situation where the quantity of goods and services demanded by consumers is equal to the quantity supplied by producers in the short term. In this state, the market is said to be in equilibrium, as there is no excess supply or demand, and prices remain stable. In the short run, some factors of production, such as capital and technology, are fixed, while others, like labor and raw materials, can be adjusted. This means that firms can only respond to changes in demand by adjusting their variable inputs, such as hiring more workers or increasing the use of raw materials. The shortrun equilibrium can be analyzed using the concepts of aggregate demand (AD) and aggregate supply (AS). The AD curve represents the total demand for goods and services in an economy, while the AS curve represents the total supply of goods and services. The point where these two curves intersect is the shortrun equilibrium, which determines the equilibrium price level and the level of real output (GDP) in the economy. In the shortrun equilibrium, firms may not be operating at their full capacity, and there may be unemployment or underemployment of resources. However, there are no forces pushing the economy away from this equilibrium, as the market has adjusted to the prevailing demand and supply conditions. It is important to note that the shortrun equilibrium may not necessarily be the same as the longrun equilibrium, where all factors of production are fully utilized, and the economy operates at its potential output. In the long run, adjustments in capital, technology, and other factors can lead to a new equilibrium with different price levels and output levels.","completion":"25"},{"prompt":"Please solve the equation sin(4*x) + x = 54 and provide all the roots using newtonraphson method. Relevant Theorem: The NewtonRaphson method, also known as the Newton's method, is a widely used iterative numerical technique for finding the approximate roots of a realvalued function. It is named after Sir Isaac Newton and Joseph Raphson, who independently developed the method in the 17th century. The method is based on the idea of linear approximation, where a function is approximated by its tangent line at a given point. The intersection of this tangent line with the xaxis provides a better approximation of the root than the initial point. This process is then repeated iteratively until the desired level of accuracy is achieved. Given a function f(x) and an initial guess x0 for the root, the NewtonRaphson method can be described by the following iterative formula: x1 = x0 f(x0) / f'(x0) Here, f'(x0) is the derivative of the function f(x) evaluated at the point x0. The new approximation x1 is then used as the starting point for the next iteration, and the process is repeated until the difference between successive approximations is smaller than a predefined tolerance level or a maximum number of iterations is reached. The NewtonRaphson method converges rapidly when the initial guess is close to the actual root and the function is wellbehaved. However, the method may fail to converge or converge to a wrong root if the initial guess is not close enough to the actual root, or if the function has multiple roots, or if the derivative of the function is zero or nearly zero at the root. Despite these limitations, the NewtonRaphson method is widely used in various fields of science and engineering due to its simplicity and fast convergence properties when applied to wellbehaved functions.","completion":"[53.52, 54.25, 54.76]"},{"prompt":"The electric flux through a spherical surface is 4.0times 10^4 N cdot m^2/C.

It is named after the German mathematician and physicist Carl Friedrich Gauss. Gauss's Law is mathematically expressed as: ∮E • dA = Q_enclosed / ε₀ where: ∮E • dA represents the electric flux through a closed surface (integral of the electric field E over the surface area A) Q_enclosed is the total electric charge enclosed within the closed surface ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity, a constant value that characterizes the electric properties of a vacuum In simple terms, Gauss's Law states that the electric flux through any closed surface is proportional to the total electric charge enclosed within that surface. This law is useful for calculating the electric field in situations with high symmetry, such as spherical, cylindrical, or planar charge distributions. Gauss's Law is one of the four Maxwell's equations, which together form the foundation of classical electromagnetism. It is also closely related to the principle of conservation of electric charge, as it implies that the net electric charge within a closed surface cannot change unless there is a flow of charge across the surface.","completion":"3.54e-07"},{"prompt":"w many ways are there to partition a set of 5 elements into 3 nonempty cycles? Relevant Theorem: Stirling Numbers of the first kind, denoted by S(n, k) or sometimes by s(n, k), are a set of numbers that arise in combinatorics, the study of counting and arranging objects. They are named after the Scottish mathematician James Stirling. These numbers are used to count the number of permutations of n elements with exactly k cycles. A cycle in a permutation is a subset of elements where each element is replaced by another element in the subset, and the last element is replaced by the first element. For example, in the permutation (1, 3, 2), there are two cycles: (1) and (3, 2), where 3 replaces 2 and 2 replaces 3. Stirling Numbers of the first kind can be defined recursively using the following formula: S(n, k) = (n 1) * S(n 1, k) + S(n 1, k 1) with the initial conditions: S(n, 0) = 0 for n > 0, S(0, 0) = 1, S(n, n) = 1 for n > 0.

Relevant Theorem: In calculus, inflection points are points on a curve where the curve changes its concavity, i.e., it switches from being concave up (shaped like a U) to concave down (shaped like an upsidedown U), or vice versa. In other words, an inflection point is a point on the curve where the second derivative of the function changes its sign. To find inflection points, you need to follow these steps: 1. Find the first derivative (dy/dx) of the function, which represents the slope of the tangent line to the curve at any given point. 2. Find the second derivative (d^2y/dx^2) of the function, which represents the curvature or concavity of the curve at any given point. 3. Set the second derivative equal to zero and solve for x. These xvalues are potential inflection points. 4. Test the intervals around the potential inflection points to determine if the second derivative changes its sign. If it does, then the point is an inflection point. Inflection points are important in calculus because they help us understand the behavior of a function and its graph.

The theorem provides a systematic way to find the coefficients of the terms in the expanded form of the binomial expression. The Binomial Theorem states that for any nonnegative integer 'n' and any real numbers 'a' and 'b': (a + b)^n = Σ [C(n, k) * a^(nk) * b^k] where the summation (Σ) runs from k = 0 to k = n, and C(n, k) represents the binomial coefficient, which is the number of ways to choose 'k' items from a set of 'n' items, also denoted as n choose k or C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (nk)!), where '!' denotes the factorial function. The binomial coefficients can also be represented using Pascal's Triangle, a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The 'n'th row of Pascal's Triangle contains the coefficients of the binomial expansion of (a + b)^n. In combinatorics, the Binomial Theorem is used to solve counting problems, such as finding the number of ways to arrange objects, the number of subsets of a given size, and the probability of certain outcomes in experiments.

These theorems are fundamental in understanding the properties of mathematical objects and their convergence or divergence. There are several important limiting theorems in mathematical analysis, including: 1. Limit of a sequence: A sequence is a list of numbers arranged in a specific order. The limit of a sequence is the value that the terms of the sequence approach as the index goes to infinity. If the limit exists, the sequence is said to be convergent; otherwise, it is divergent. 2. Limit of a function: The limit of a function is the value that the function approaches as its input approaches a specific value. Limits are used to define continuity, derivatives, and integrals, which are essential concepts in calculus. 3. Squeeze theorem: Also known as the sandwich theorem or the pinching theorem, this theorem states that if a function is squeezed between two other functions that have the same limit at a specific point, then the squeezed function must also have the same limit at that point. 4. Monotone convergence theorem: This theorem states that a monotone (either nondecreasing or nonincreasing) and bounded sequence always converges to a limit. 5.

The firm faces a market demand curve given by Q = 53 P. Calculate the consumer surplus obtained by consumers under perfect competition (where price = marginal cost)? Relevant Theorem: Consumer surplus is an economic concept that represents the difference between the total amount that consumers are willing to pay for a good or service and the total amount they actually pay. It is a measure of the benefit or satisfaction that consumers receive from participating in the market, beyond the price they pay for the goods or services. In other words, consumer surplus is the difference between the maximum price a consumer is willing to pay for a product and the actual market price they end up paying. When the market price is lower than the maximum price a consumer is willing to pay, the consumer experiences a surplus or gain in their overall satisfaction. Consumer surplus can be illustrated using a demand curve, which shows the relationship between the quantity of a good demanded and its price. The consumer surplus is the area below the demand curve and above the market price, up to the quantity of goods consumed. A higher consumer surplus indicates that consumers are receiving more value from the goods or services they purchase, while a lower consumer surplus suggests that consumers are paying closer to their maximum willingness to pay. Factors such as competition, market efficiency, and changes in consumer preferences can influence consumer surplus.","completion":"1152"},{"prompt":"Does the following series sum_{i=0}^{infty} frac{n1}{n^3+1} converge?

A series is said to converge if the sum of its terms approaches a finite value as the number of terms (n) goes to infinity. In other words, the series converges if there exists a limit L such that: lim (n→∞) S_n = L where S_n is the partial sum of the series up to the nth term. If the limit does not exist or is infinite, the series is said to diverge. There are various tests and methods to determine the convergence or divergence of a series, such as the comparison test, the ratio test, the root test, the integral test, and the alternating series test, among others.

True or False? Relevant Theorem: Channel capacity, in information theory, refers to the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted over a communication channel without error, given a specific level of noise and signal interference. It is usually measured in bits per second (bps) or other units of data rate. The concept of channel capacity was introduced by Claude Shannon in his groundbreaking 1948 paper, A Mathematical Theory of Communication. Shannon's theorem, also known as the noisychannel coding theorem, states that there exists an upper limit to the rate at which information can be transmitted over a noisy channel with an arbitrarily low probability of error. This upper limit is called the channel capacity. The channel capacity depends on several factors, including: 1. Bandwidth: The range of frequencies available for transmitting signals over the channel. A larger bandwidth allows for more information to be transmitted per unit of time. 2. Signaltonoise ratio (SNR): The ratio of the power of the signal to the power of the noise in the channel. A higher SNR means that the signal is less affected by noise, allowing for more reliable transmission of information. 3. Coding and modulation schemes: The way information is represented and transmitted over the channel can also affect the channel capacity. Efficient coding and modulation techniques can help to maximize the amount of information that can be transmitted without error. In summary, channel capacity is a fundamental concept in information theory that quantifies the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted over a communication channel with a given level of noise and signal interference. It is an important parameter in the design and analysis of communication systems, as it helps to determine the limits of reliable information transmission.","completion":"True"},{"prompt":"Let C be a variable length code that satisfies the Kraft inequality with equality but does not satisfy the prefix condition. Then C has finite decoding delay. True or False? Relevant Theorem: Kraft inequality is a fundamental concept in information theory, specifically in the area of prefix coding. It is named after Leon G. Kraft, who first introduced it in 1949. The inequality provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of uniquely decodable prefix codes, which are widely used in data compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding. In simple terms, Kraft inequality states that for a prefix code with a set of codewords, the sum of the probabilities of each codeword, raised to the power of the length of the codeword, must be less than or equal to 1. Mathematically, it can be expressed as: Σ (2^(li)) ≤ 1 Here, 'li' represents the length of the ith codeword, and the summation is taken over all the codewords in the code. The importance of Kraft inequality lies in its ability to ensure the existence of a prefix code with given codeword lengths. If a set of codeword lengths satisfies the Kraft inequality, then there exists a prefix code with those lengths. Conversely, if a prefix code exists with a certain set of codeword lengths, then those lengths must satisfy the Kraft inequality. In summary, Kraft inequality is a crucial concept in information theory that helps in designing efficient and uniquely decodable prefix codes for data compression and error correction. It provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of such codes, ensuring that the code can be constructed and decoded unambiguously.","completion":"False"},{"prompt":"Each day Paul, who is in third grade, eats lunch at school.

If Twinkies cost 0.10 each and soda costs 0.25 per cup, Paul's mom gives him 1, how many Twinkies should Paul buy to maximize utility? Relevant Theorem: Utility Maximization is a fundamental concept in economics that refers to the process by which individuals, households, or firms make choices to allocate their resources in a way that maximizes their overall satisfaction or utility. Utility is a measure of the satisfaction or happiness that a consumer derives from consuming goods and services. The utility maximization principle is based on the assumption that individuals are rational decisionmakers who aim to achieve the highest level of satisfaction given their limited resources, such as income, time, and information. This concept is central to understanding consumer behavior and demand in microeconomics. To achieve utility maximization, consumers must consider the following factors: 1. Preferences: Consumers have different preferences for various goods and services, which determine the utility they derive from consuming them. These preferences are usually represented by a utility function that assigns a numerical value to each combination of goods and services. 2. Budget constraint: Consumers have limited resources, such as income or wealth, which restrict their ability to consume goods and services. The budget constraint represents the combinations of goods and services that a consumer can afford given their income and the prices of the goods. 3. Marginal utility: This refers to the additional satisfaction or utility gained from consuming one more unit of a good or service. As a consumer consumes more of a good, the marginal utility typically decreases, a concept known as diminishing marginal utility. To maximize utility, consumers must allocate their resources in a way that equates the marginal utility per dollar spent on each good or service. In other words, consumers should spend their income on goods and services in such a way that the ratio of marginal utility to price is the same for all goods and services consumed. This ensures that they are getting the most satisfaction possible from their limited resources. In summary, utility maximization is a key concept in economics that explains how rational consumers make choices to allocate their resources to achieve the highest level of satisfaction or utility. This principle is essential for understanding consumer behavior, demand, and the functioning of markets.","completion":"5"},{"prompt":"rheumatoid arthritis, the body' s immune system misfunctions by attacking healthy cells in the joints causing the release of a hormone that in turn causes pain and swelling.

In the metalworking industry last year, firms with PRP contracts in place showed productivity per worker on average 13 percent higher than that of their competitors who used more traditional contracts. If, on the basis of the evidence above, it is argued that PRP contracts increase worker productivity, which of the following, if true, would most seriously weaken that argument? A: Many firms in the metalworking industry have modernized production equipment in the last five years, and most of these introduced PRP contracts at the same time. B: Under PRP contracts costs other than labor costs, such as plant, machinery, and energy, make up an increased proportion of the total cost of each unit of output. C: Because introducing PRP contracts greatly changes individual workers' relationships to the firm, negotiating the introduction of PRP contracts in complex and time consuming. D: In firms in the metalworking industry where PRP contracts are in place, the average takehome pay is 15 percent higher than it is in those firms where workers have more traditional contracts.

The summit would accommodate the complex as currently designed, with some room left for expansion. There are no large cities near the mountain, so neither smog nor artificial light interferes with atmospheric transparency. Critics claim that Mount Shalko is a unique ecological site, but the observatory need not be a threat to endemic lifeforms. In fact, since it would preclude recreational use of the mountain, it should be their salvation. It is estimated that 20, 000 recreational users visit the mountain every year, posing a threat to the wildlife. Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the astronomer's argument? A: More than a dozen insect and plant species endemic to Mount Shalko are found nowhere else on earth. B: The building of the observatory would not cause the small towns near Mount Shalko eventually to develop into a large city, complete with smog, bright lights, and an influx of recreation seekers. C: A survey conducted by a team of park rangers concluded that two other mountains in the same general area have more potential for recreational use than Mount Shalko. D: Having a complex that covers most of the summit, as well as having the necessary security fences and access road on the mountain, could involve just as much ecological disruption as does the current level of recreational use. Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"D"},{"prompt":"Opponents of peat harvesting in this country argue that it would alter the ecological balance of our peatrich wetlands and that, as a direct consequence of this, much of the country' s water supply would be threatened with contamination.

Since the industry refuses to take action, it is the national government that must regulate industry safety standards. In particular, the government has to at least require oil companies to put double hulls on their tankers and to assume financial responsibility for accidents. Industry representative: The industry alone should be responsible for devising safety standards because of its expertise in handling oil and its understanding of the cost entailed. Implementing the doublehull proposal is not currently feasible because it creates new safety issues. Furthermore, the cost would be burdensome to the industry and consumers. Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument of the environmentalist depends? A: Government safety regulations are developed in a process of negotiation with industry leaders and independent experts. B: Environmental concerns outweigh all financial considerations when developing safety standards. C: The requirement of two hulls on oil tankers, although initially costly, will save money over time by reducing cleanup costs.

The article' s evidence was the decreasing number and size of strikes, as if the reason for the unions' existence was to organize strikes. Surely, in a modern industrial society, the calling of a strike is evidence that the negotiating position of the union was too weak. Strong unions do not need to call strikes. They can concentrate their efforts on working with others in the labor market to achieve common goals, such as profitable and humane working conditions. The argument criticizing the newspaper article is directed toward establishing which one of the following as its main conclusion? A: The reason for unions' existence is to work for goals such as profitable and humane working conditions by organizing strikes. B: Although unions represent the interests of their members, that does not preclude them from having interests in common with other participants in the labor market. C: There is no reason to believe, on the basis of what the newspaper article said, that union strength in Britain is declining. D: The negotiating position of a union is weak if the only means it has of achieving its end is a strike or the threat of a strike.

Tubular and vaseshaped sponges can eject filtered water without assistance from surrounding ocean currents and thus are adapted to slowmoving, quiet waters. Because of their shape, however, these sponges cannot live in strong currents, since strong currents would dislodge them. Both of these varieties of sponge were widespread during the late Jurassic period. The statements above, if true, most strongly support which one of the following claims? A: No types of sponge live in large colonies, since sponges do not flourish in areas where much of the water has been filtered by other sponges. B: Few tubular or vaseshaped sponges lived before the late Jurassic period. C: During the late Jurassic period there were many areas of the ocean floor where currents were weak.

The gold mined in this region was the purest known. Its gold content of 92 percent allowed coins to be minted without refining the gold, and indeed coins minted from this source of gold can be recognized because they have that gold content. The mints could refine gold and produced other kinds of coins that had much purer gold content, but the Senegalese gold was never refined. As a preliminary to negotiating prices, merchants selling goods often specified that payment should be in the coins minted from Senegalese gold. Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain this preference? A: During this period most daytoday trading was conducted using silver coins, though gold coins were used for costly transactions and longdistance commerce. B: Since gold coins' monetary value rested on the gold they contained, payments were frequently made using coins minted in several different countries.

Yet, after the instance of infection, antibodies take about four weeks to appear in the fish' s blood, and the test will find no results before then. Catching a live Bluetail Moonbeam and shipping it to the United States takes a little more than a week. Once the Bluetail Moonbeam is in captivity, shippers can eliminate all new sources of infection, but unfortunately, some Bluetail Moonbeams might be infected days or even hours before being caught. Thus, even running the antibody test on each Bluetail Moonbeam entering the country would still allow infected fish into the American stocks. Which of the following, if performed by the government, could logically be expected to overcome the problem with the plan to limit the spread of this virus in the Bluetail Moonbeam? A: Funding research into either an inoculation or a cure for this viral infection.

This increase demonstrates that there was a dramatic jump in the number of people who learned how to read in the years after publishers first started producing books on the printing press. Which one of the following statements, if true, casts doubt on the argument? A: Books that were printed on the printing press in the first years after its invention often circulated among friends in informal reading clubs or libraries. B: During the first years after the invention of the printing press, letter writing by people who wrote without the assistance of scribes or clerks exhibited a dramatic increase. C: The first printed books published after the invention of the printing press would have been useless to illiterate people, since the books had virtually no illustrations. D: In the first years after the printing press was invented, printed books were purchased primarily by people who had always bought and read expensive manuscripts but could afford a greater number of printed books for the same money. Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"D"},{"prompt":"A recent study monitored the blood pressure of people petting domestic animals in the laboratory.

During droughts, more members of large finch species survive because their bills are large enough to crack large, hard seeds, giving them a food supply unavailable to smaller birds. In rainy years, fewer members of the large finch species survive because the additional moisture fosters the growth of plants that produce small seeds. The larger finch varieties have to consume enormous numbers of small seeds to meet their energy demands, and some just cannot eat them fast enough. Which one of the following must be assumed in order to justify the conclusion that climatic variations cause a major difference in survival rates of small and large finches? A: During drought conditions, the weather promotes the growth of plants that produce small, hard seeds. B: A lengthy period of rainy weather results in fewer large, hard seeds being produced. C: In rainy periods, the small finches gather enough food to grow much larger and heavier, but their ultimate size is limited by their inability to eat small seeds fast.

This situation causes an enormous and dangerous drain on increasingly scarce public resources. Each false alarm wastes an average of 45 minutes of police time. As a result police are consistently taken away from responding to other legitimate calls for service, and a disproportionate share of police service goes to alarm system users, who are mostly businesses and affluent homeowners. However, burglar alarm systems, unlike car alarm systems, are effective in deterring burglaries, so the only acceptable solution is to fine burglar alarm system owners the cost of 45 minutes of police time for each false alarm their systems generate. The statement that burglar alarm systems, unlike car alarm systems, are effective in deterring burglaries plays which one of the following roles in the argument? A: It provides a basis for excluding as unacceptable one obvious alternative to the proposal of fining owners of burglar alarm systems for false alarms. B: It explains why a disproportionate number of the burglar alarms responded to by police come from alarm systems owned by businesses. C: It gives a reason why police might be more inclined to respond to burglar alarms than to car alarms.

Investigators blame the severity of the outbreak on the overuse of antibiotics, since the salmonella bacteria tested were shown to be drugresistant. But this is unlikely because patients in the country where the outbreak occurred cannot obtain antibiotics to treat illness without a prescription, and the country's doctors prescribe antibiotics less readily than do doctors in any other European country. Which of the following, if true, would most weaken the microbiologist's reasoning? A: Salmonella has been shown to spread easily along the distribution chains of certain vegetables, such as raw tomatoes. B: Use of antibiotics in two countries that neighbor the country where the outbreak occurred has risen over the past decade. C: Physicians in the country where the outbreak occurred have become hesitant to prescribe antibiotics since they are frequently in short supply.

But willingness to pay is not proportional to need. In the real world, some people simply cannot pay as much as others. As a result, a price increase will allocate goods to the people with the most money, not to those with the most need. Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the consumer advocate's argument by the claim that willingness to pay is not proportional to need? A: It is the overall conclusion of the argument. B: It denies a claim that the argument takes to be assumed in the reasoning that it rejects.

The questionable pattern of reasoning in which one of the following arguments is most similar to that in the argument above? A: Action movies that involve complicated and dangerous specialeffects scenes are enormously expensive to produce. Hence, since traditional dramatic or comedic films contain no such scenes, it is probable that they are relatively inexpensive to produce.

The reason for this behavior is probably that the small mammals on which owls feed are especially scarce in the forests where boreal owls live, and the relative scarcity of prey requires the owls to range more extensively to find sufficient food. Which of the following, if true, most helps to confirm the explanation above? A: Boreal owls range over larger areas in regions where food of the sort eaten by small mammals is sparse than they do in regions where such food is abundant. B: The boreal owl requires less food, relative to its weight, than is required by members of other owl species. C: Some boreal owls range over an area eight times larger than the area over which any other owl of similar size ranges. D: After their young hatch, boreal owls must hunt more often than before in order to feed both themselves and their newly hatched young.

It is clear that in doing so the mayor is sacrificing the city' s interests to personal interests. The mayor cites figures to show that, in the current market, fees of the size proposed would significantly reduce the number of building starts and thus, on balance, result in a revenue loss to the city. But the important point is that the mayor' s family is heavily involved in real estate development and thus has a strong financial interest in the matter. Which one of the following most accurately and completely expresses the main conclusion of the city council member's argument? A: Significantly reducing the number of building starts would not, on balance, result in revenue loss to the city. B: Imposing real estate development fees is the best way for the city to exploit the available sources of revenue. C: The mayor's family has a strong financial interest in preventing the passage of legislation that would impose real estate development fees. D: In blocking council members' attempts to impose real estate development fees, the mayor is sacrificing the city's interests to personal interests.

Moreover, if the words are clearly defined and consistently used, the actual words chosen make no difference to an argument' s soundness. Thus, how an argument is expressed can have no bearing on whether it is a good argument. Emile: Badly chosen words can make even the soundest argument a poor one. After all, many words have social and political connotations that influence people' s response to claims expressed in those words, regardless of how carefully and explicitly those words are defined. Since whether people will acknowledge a fact is affected by how the fact is expressed, the conclusions they actually draw are also affected. The point at issue between Emile and Sabina is whether A: a sound argument in support of a given conclusion is a better argument than any unsound argument for that same conclusion B: a word can be defined without taking into account its social and political connotations C: it would be a good policy to avoid using words that are likely to lead people either to misunderstand the claims being made or to reason badly about those claims D: a factor that affects neither the truth of an argument's premises nor the logical relation between its premises and its conclusion can cause an argument to be a bad one Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"D"},{"prompt":"A university study reported that between 1975 and 1983 the length of the average workweek in a certain country increased significantly. A governmental study, on the other hand, shows a significant decline in the length of the average workweek for the same period. Examination of the studies shows, however, that they used different methods of investigation; thus there is no need to look further for an explanation of the difference in the studies' results. The argument's reasoning is flawed because the argument fails to A: recognize that varying economic conditions result in the average workweek changing in length B: recognize that two different methods of investigation can yield identical results C: distinguish between a study produced for the purposes of the operation of government and a study produced as part of university research D: distinguish between a method of investigation and the purpose of an investigation Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"B"},{"prompt":"Not surprisingly, there are no professors under the age of eighteen.

A: The ancient narratives persist largely because they speak to basic themes and features of the human condition. B: Because no single person is the author of a folktale, folktales must reflect the values of a culture rather than those of an individual.

Consumer psychologists hypothesize that simply seeing a creditcard logo makes many creditcard holders willing to spend more because it reminds them that their spending power exceeds the cash they have immediately available. Which of the following, if true, most strongly supports the psychologists' interpretation of the studies? A: Patrons who are under financial pressure from their creditcard obligations tend to tip less when presented with a restaurant bill on a tray with a creditcard logo than when the tray has no logo.

A: Scientists are far from being able to link any specific genes to specific inclinations. B: Many people, including identical twins, undergo radical changes in their lifestyles at some point in their lives. C: While some studies of identical twins separated at birth reveal a high percentage of similar personality traits, they also show a few differences.

As achievements, buildings are not like scientific discoveries, but like movies, which compete for awards for best picture. Thus, it would be better if the top prize in architecture were awarded to the best building rather than the best architect. The argument proceeds by A: making a distinction between two different types of objects in order to conclude that one has more inherent value than the other B: contending that an action is inappropriate by presenting an argument that a corresponding action in an analogous case is inappropriate C: reaching a conclusion about the way something should be done in one field on the basis of comparisons with corresponding practices in other fields D: pointing to similarities between two practices as a basis for concluding that criticisms of one practice can rightly be applied to the other Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"C"},{"prompt":"Many people change their wills on their own every few years, in response to significant changes in their personal or financial circumstances. This practice can create a problem for the executor when these people are careless and do not date their wills: the executor will then often know neither which one of several undated wills is the most recent, nor whether the will drawn up last has ever been found. Ttherefore, people should not only date their wills but also state in any new will which will it supersedes, for then there would not be a problem to begin with. The reasoning in the argument is flawed because the argument A: fails to distinguish between prevention of a problem and successful containment of the adverse effects that the problem might cause B: treats a partial solution to the stated problem as though it were a complete solution C: proposes a solution to the stated problem that does not actually solve the problem but merely makes someone else responsible for solving the problem D: claims that a certain action would be a change for the better without explicitly considering what negative consequences the action might have Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"B"},{"prompt":"Announcement for a television program: Are female physicians more sensitive than male physicians to the needs of women patients?

Young adults can readily distinguish between such sounds only in languages that they regularly use. It is known that the physiological capacity to hear begins to deteriorate after infancy. So the observed difference in the abilities of infants and young adults to distinguish between acoustically similar speech sounds must be the result of the physiological deterioration of hearing. The reasoning in the argument is flawed because the argument A: does not explain the procedures used to measure the abilities of two very different populations B: takes a factor that might contribute to an explanation of the observed difference as a sufficient explanation for that difference C: sets an arbitrary cutoff point of six months for the age below which infants are able to distinguish acoustically similar speech sounds D: assumes that what is true of a group of people taken collectively is also true of any individual within that group Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"B"},{"prompt":"Gamba: Munoz claims that the Southwest Hopeville Neighbors Association overwhelmingly opposes the new water system, citing this as evidence of citywide opposition.

The candidate will make a stop in Paulsville unless Salisbury is made part of the itinerary. Unfortunately, a stop in Salisbury is out of the question. Clearly, then, a stop in Longtown can be ruled out. The reasoning in the argument above most closely parallels that in which one of the following arguments? A: The chef never has both fresh radishes and fresh green peppers available for the chef's salad at the same time. If she uses fresh radishes, she also uses spinach. But currently there is no spinach to be had. It can be inferred, then, that she will not be using fresh green peppers. B: Tom will definitely support Parker if Mendoza does not apply; and Tom will not support both Parker and Chung. Since, as it turns out, Mendoza will not apply, it follows that Chung will not get Tom's support. C: In agricultural pest control, either pesticides or the introduction of natural enemies of the pest, but not both, will work. Of course, neither will be needed if pestresistant crops are planted. So if pesticides are in fact needed, it must be that there are no natural enemies of the pest. D: The city cannot afford to build both a new stadium and the new road that would be needed to get there. But neither of the two projects is worth doing without the other. Since the city will not undertake any but worthwhile projects, the new stadium will not be constructed at this time.

In a recent study, however, it was found that after an increase in the minimum wage, fastfood restaurants kept on roughly the same number of minimumwage employees as before the increase. Ttherefore, laissezfaire economics is not entirely accurate. The essayist's argument depends on assuming which one of the following? A: If laissezfaire economics makes an incorrect prediction about the minimum wage, then all the doctrines of laissezfaire economics are inaccurate. B: The national unemployment rate did not increase following the increase in the minimum wage. C: Minimumwage job availability at fastfood restaurants included in the study was representative of minimumwage job availability in general.

The painting was thus deemed to have been produced sometime after 1804. A 2009 analysis also found cobalt, but that analysis suggested that the painting might have been produced before 1804. Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy in the information above? A: The 2009 analysis used sophisticated scientific equipment that can detect much smaller amounts of cobalt than could the equipment used for the 1955 analysis. B: New information that came to light in the 1990s suggested that cobalt blue was used only rarely in Italy in the years immediately following 1804. C: The 2009 analysis took more samples from the painting than the 1955 analysis did, though those samples were smaller.

Sauk, lacks aesthetic merit because it employs Providence' s own uniquely potent system of symbolic motifs in the service of a political ideal that Providence and, significantly, some of these critics as well would reject. Granting that Sauk is more imitator than innovator, and that he maintained political views very different from those Providence maintained, it has yet to be shown that these facts make his writings any less subtly or powerfully crafted than those of his more esteemed mentor. So the critics' argument should be rejected. The literature professor argues that the conclusion drawn by the critics has not really been established, on the grounds that A: these critics are motivated by antipathy toward Sauk's political ideas B: the claims made in support of this conclusion have not been shown to be relevant to it C: Sauk's work has aesthetic merit D: the claims made in support of this conclusion have not been shown to be correct Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"B"},{"prompt":"Many movies starring top actors will do well at the box office because the actors are already well known and have a loyal following. Movies starring unknown actors are ttherefore unlikely to do well. The flawed reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following?

Which one of the following most closely conforms to the principle illustrated by Evan's criticism of vegetarians who eat seafood? A: It is uncertain whether all owners of the defective vehicles know that their vehicles are being recalled by the manufacturer. Thus, we should expect that some vehicles that have been recalled have not been returned. B: I am opposed to using incentives such as reduced taxes to attract businesses to our region.

A: The argument assumes that corporate greed is the byproduct of the millennial attitude with no sufficient evidence backing this claim. The evidence presented has more to do with millennial behavior related to volunteering and less to do with direct corporate greed.

Public advocate: But with judges stripped of discretionary powers, there can be no leniency even where it would be appropriate. So juries now sometimes acquit a given defendant solely because the jurors feel that the mandatory sentence would be too harsh. Those juries, then, do not return an accurate verdict on the defendant' s guilt. This is why it is imperative that the legislation instituting mandatory jail sentences be repealed. The public advocate responds to the politician's argument by doing which one of the following? A: arguing that leniency is not a trait of individuals but that, rather, it is a property of certain kinds of decisions B: charging that the politician exaggerated the severity of a problem in order to justify a sweeping solution C: claiming that the politician's evidence, properly analyzed, has no bearing on the conclusion the politician derives from it D: arguing that an analysis of the consequences of certain legislation undermines the politician's conclusion Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"D"},{"prompt":"Policy analyst: Increasing the size of a police force is only a stopgap method of crime prevention; it does not get at the root causes of crime. Ttherefore, city officials should not respond to rising crime rates by increasing the size of their city' s police force. The flawed reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles the flawed reasoning in the policy analyst's argument? A: Because taking this drug does not cure the disease for which it is prescribed, but only reduces the disease's most harmful effects, doctors should not continue to prescribe this drug. B: We will never fully understand what causes people to engage in criminal activity. Ttherefore, we should investigate other ways to improve society's ability to combat crime. C: Although less effective in preventing theft than security guards, burglar alarm systems are more affordable to maintain. Because the greater loss from theft when alarms are used is outweighed by their lower cost, companies are advised always to use burglar alarm systems. D: Swamps play an important role in allaying the harsh effects of floods because they absorb a great deal of water. Although dams prevent many floods, they worsen the effects of the greatest floods by drying up swamps. Thus dams should not be built.

Today, it is known that the high cholesterol content of butterfat makes it harmful to human health. Since the public should be encouraged to eat foods with lower rather than higher butterfat content and since the term imitation with its connotations of falsity deters many people from purchasing products so designated, manufacturers who wish to give reducedbutterfat butter the more appealing name of lite butter should be allowed to do so. Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument? A: Most people deterred from eating imitation butter because of its name choose alternatives with a lower butterfat content than this product has. B: Some individuals who need to reduce their intake of cholesterol are not deterred from using the reducedbutterfat product by the negative connotations of the term imitation. C: The manufacturers who wish to call their product lite butter plan to change the composition of the product so that it contains more water than it now does.

A: whether the current methods of disposing of sewage sludge by dumping do environmental damage B: whether the burning of oil from sewage sludge would, in contrast to nuclear power production, produce gases that would have a harmful warming effect on climate worldwide C: whether the processes that are used to turn sewage into clean water and sewage sludge have been improved in recent decades D: whether the cost of producing and using oil from sewage sludge would be economically sustainable Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"C"},{"prompt":"Coherent solutions for the problem of reducing healthcare costs cannot be found within the current piecemeal system of paying these costs. The reason is that this system gives healthcare providers and insurers every incentive to shift, wherever possible, the costs of treating illness onto each other or any other party, including the patient. That clearly is the lesson of the various reforms of the 1980s: push in on one part of this pliable spending balloon and an equally expensive bulge pops up elsewhere. For example, when the government healthcare insurance program for the poor cut costs by disallowing payments for some visits to physicians, patients with advanced illness later presented themselves at hospital emergency rooms in increased numbers. The argument proceeds by A: employing an analogy to characterize interrelationships B: demonstrating that cooperation is feasible by citing an instance C: attributing without justification fraudulent intent to people D: showing that shifting costs onto the patient contradicts the premise of healthcare reimbursement Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"A"},{"prompt":"Fine short story writers are unlikely to become great novelists. Short story writers must master the ability to interweave the many small details that together allow mundane incidents to illuminate important truths. Because the novel drowns in such detail, novelists must focus on larger matters. Only a few writers possess both the ability to weave together many small details and the ability to focus on larger matters. The reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to the reasoning above? A: Because of the vast amount of medical knowledge one needs in order to become a successful specialist and because few people have the motivation required to obtain such knowledge, most people are unlikely to become successful specialists. B: Those who excel at one sport are unlikely to excel at another, because it is rare for someone who has the specialized talents necessary for success in one sport to also have the different specialized talents necessary for success in a different sport. C: Engineers can never design an automobile that both meets high standards for comfort and safety and uses fuel efficiently, because high levels of comfort and safety generally require that a car be heavy, while efficient use of fuel usually requires that a car be light. D: Good painters cannot become good scholars of painting. Painters are inevitably biased toward their own style of painting and, accordingly, cannot be objective scholars.

But this superiority must be measured in light of the artist' s purposes, since the high merits, for example, of Jose Rey Toledo' s work and his extraordinary artistic skills are not in doubt, despite the fact that his paintings do not literally resemble what they represent. The claim that some painters are superior to others in the execution of their artistic visions plays which one of the following roles in the argument? A: It is a claim that the argument derives from another claim and that it uses to support its conclusion. B: It is a claim that, according to the argument, is to be understood in a manner specified by the conclusion.

The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument A: overlooks the possibility that most families' incomes are below average B: fails to take into account inflation with respect to the Andersen family's income C: presumes, without providing justification, that the government makes no errors in gathering accurate estimates of family income D: fails to consider the possibility that the Andersen family's real income was above average in the recent past Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"D"},{"prompt":"Members of the Amazonian Akabe people commonly take an earlymorning drink of a tea made from the leaves of a forest plant. Although they greatly enjoy this drink, at dawn they drink it only in small amounts. Anthropologists hypothesize that since this tea is extraordinarily high in caffeine, the explanation for the Akabe' s not drinking more of it at dawn is that high caffeine intake would destroy the surefootedness that their daily tasks require. Which one of the following, if true, most seriously calls the anthropologists' explanation into question? A: The leaves used for the tea contain a soluble narcotic. B: The Akabe also drink the tea in the evening, after their day's work is done. C: The drink is full of nutrients otherwise absent from the Akabe diet.

Yet physicians in residency training are typically required to work 80hour weeks. The aforementioned restrictions on working exceptionally long hours should also be applied to resident physicians, since they too are engaged in work of a lifeordeath nature. Which one of the following is an assumption the argument depends on? A: Resident physicians have a more direct effect on the lives of others than do air traffic controllers and nuclear power plant operators. B: Those who are not engaged in work that has life ordeath consequences should only sometimes be allowed to work exceptionally long hours.

Ttherefore, it is a waste of money to order followup xrays of ankle fracture initially judged stable. Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument? A: The healing of ankle fractures that have been surgically repaired is always checked by means of a followup xray. B: Doctors who are general practitioners rather than orthopedists are less likely than orthopedists to judge the stability of an ankle fracture correctly.

They reason that since new traits evolve gradually, something like human language, albeit cruder, must exist in some species from which humans evolved. This general line of argument may be reasonable, but it simply does not follow that chimpanzees have anything like human language, because humans did not evolve from chimpanzees. While chimpanzees are indeed closely related to humans, this is because both evolved from a common ancestor. The evolution of human language might easily have begun after the extinction of that common ancestor. Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main conclusion of the anthropologist's argument? A: The evolution of human language began after the disappearance of an extinct species from which both humans and chimpanzees evolved. B: The assumption that something like human language must exist in some species from which humans evolved has no clearcut linguistic implications for chimpanzees.

An increase in the level causes the atmosphere to hold more heat, which causes more water to evaporate from the oceans, which causes increased rain. Rain washes some carbon from the air into the oceans, where it eventually becomes part of the seabed. A decrease in atmospheric carbon causes the atmosphere to hold less heat, which causes decreased evaporation from the oceans, which causes less rain, and thus less carbon is washed into the oceans. Yet some environmentalists worry that burning fossil fuels may raise atmospheric carbon to a dangerous level. It is true that a sustained increase would threaten human life. But the environmentalists should relax nature will continually adjust the carbon level. Each of the following can be inferred from the information in the passage EXCEPT: A: A decrease in the level of carbon in the atmosphere causes decreased evaporation of ocean water. B: A decrease in the level of atmospheric heat causes a decrease in the level of carbon in the atmosphere. C: An increase in the level of atmospheric heat causes increased rainfall.

Perhaps members of the artviewing public resented abstract art because they felt that its lack of realistic subject matter was a rejection of the viewers and their world. Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage? A: Abstract paintings often include shapes or forms that are suggestive of real objects or emotions. B: The general public is unable to understand the theories on which abstract painting is based. C: The artistic preferences of the artviewing public stimulated the revival. D: The artviewing public wished to see traditional subjects treated in a nontraditional manner.

If the majority of Dalton' s residents favor the proposal, the airport will be built. However, it is unlikely that a majority of Dalton' s residents would favor the proposal, for most of them believe that the airport would create noise problems. Thus, it is unlikely that the airport will be built. The reasoning in the argument is flawed in that the argument A: treats a sufficient condition for the airport's being built as a necessary condition B: overlooks the possibility that a new airport could benefit the local economy C: fails to consider whether people living near Dalton would favor building the airport D: concludes, on the basis that a certain event is unlikely to occur, that the event will not occur Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"A"},{"prompt":"Very powerful volcanic eruptions send large amounts of ash high into the atmosphere, blocking sunlight and causing abnormally cold temperatures for a year or more after the eruption.

Their claim is based on the results of surveys in which people were asked to recall how they felt at various times in the past. However, it is not clear that people are able to report accurately on their past psychological states. Ttherefore, these survey results do not justify the psychologists' claim that there is any such condition as seasonal affective disorder. The author criticizes the psychologists' claim by A: offering an alternative explanation of the variation in the occurrence of psychological problems across seasons B: demonstrating that fewer people actually suffer from seasonal affective disorder than psychologists had previously thought C: questioning the representativeness of the population sample surveyed by the psychologists D: questioning an assumption that the author attributes to the psychologists Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"D"},{"prompt":"One should always capitalize the main words and the first and last words of a title.

The malaria parasite can remain for up to forty days in the blood of an infected person. The disease cannot be passed from person to person, unless a noninfected person is exposed to the blood of an infected person. Theoretically, malaria could be eradicated in any given area, if all the mosquitoes carrying malaria in that area are exterminated. If such a course of action is carried out at a worldwide level, then the global eradication of malaria is possible. Which of the following, if true, suggests that the epidemiologist's plan for eliminating malaria is not viable? A: A person who is infected with malaria can infect a mosquito that is not carrying malaria, if that mosquito bites such a person. B: Malaria is still endemic in many parts of the world, and many health workers believe that the global eradication of malaria is not possible. C: Some people in areas where malaria is rife have developed an immunity to mosquitos, yet they also show a higher incidence of genetic disorders such as sicklecell anemia.

Many teachers fear computers for the same reason. But this reason is mistaken. Computerized instruction requires more, not less, time of instructors, which indicates that any reduction in the number of teachers would require an accompanying reduction in courses offered. The statement that the educational use of computers enables schools to teach far more courses with far fewer teachers figures in the argument in which one of the following ways? A: It is a statement offered in support of the argument's main conclusion. B: It is the argument's main conclusion. C: It is presented as a possible explanation for an observation that follows it.

Experiments then suggested, however, a fifth universal force of mutual repulsion between particles of matter. This fifth force would explain the occurrence in the experiments of a smaller measurement of the gravitational attraction between bodies than the established theory predicted. Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument that there is a fifth universal force? A: No previously established scientific results are incompatible with the notion of a fifth universal force. B: The extremely sophisticated equipment used for the experiments was not available to physicists before the 1970s. C: The experiments were conducted by physicists in remote geological settings in which factors affecting the force of gravity could not be measured with any degree of precision.

Nothing brings more recognition than overthrowing conventional wisdom. It is accordingly unsurprising that some scientists are skeptical of the widely accepted predictions of global warming. What is instead remarkable is that with hundreds of researchers striving to make breakthroughs in climatology, very few find evidence that global warming is unlikely. The information above provides the most support for which one of the following statements? A: Research in global warming is primarily driven by a desire for recognition in the scientific community. B: Most researchers in climatology have substantial motive to find evidence that would discredit the global warming hypothesis.

The columnist's reasoning most closely conforms to which one of the following principles? A: It is reasonable to take a strong position on an issue if one fully understands the issue and has considered the evidence regarding that issue impartially. B: One should try to understand an issue fully if doing so will help one to avoid misinterpreting or ignoring evidence regarding that issue. C: To ensure that one has impartially considered the evidence regarding an issue on which one has taken a strong position, one should avoid misinterpreting or ignoring evidence regarding that issue.

Yet it is difficult to predict the result of a fair coin flip. Which of the following, if true, contributes most to an explanation of why the outcome of a coin flip is difficult to predict even though it is well determined? A: Coin flipping has been used as a prime example of a random process for decades. B: That the results of coin flipping are well determined runs counter to the randomness that physicists have been finding in more and more processes once thought to be determined. C: An accurate prediction of the result of a coin flip requires extraordinarily precise estimation of height and impulse.

But the author' s contention that being hunted by humans contributed to the woolly mammoth's extinction is surely wrong since, as paleontologists know, no spearheads have ever been found among the many mammoth bones that have been unearthed. Which of the following, if true, provides the strongest reason for discounting the evidence Perkins cites in arguing against the contention that being hunted by humans contributed to the North American extinction of woolly mammoths? A: Cave paintings in North America that date from 12, 000 years ago depict woolly mammoths as well as a variety of other animals, including deer and buffalo. B: Because of the great effort that would have been required to produce each stone spearhead, hunters would have been unlikely to leave them behind. C: At sites where mammoth bones dating from 12, 000 years ago have been unearthed, bones of other mammals have rarely been found.

A painting, in contrast, is not presented one part at a time to the viewer; there is thus no particular path that the viewer' s eye must follow in order to read the painting. Ttherefore, an essential distinction between the experiences of hearing music and of viewing paintings is that hearing music has a temporal dimension but viewing a painting has none. The reasoning in the argument is flawed because A: relying on the metaphor of reading to characterize how a painting is viewed presupposes the correctness of the conclusion to be drawn on the basis of that characterization B: the argument does not allow for the possibility of being immersed in experiencing a painting without being conscious of the passage of time C: the absence of a particular path that the eye must follow does not entail that the eye follows no path D: the argument fails to bring out the aspects of music and painting that are common to both as forms of artistic expression Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"C"},{"prompt":"When volcanic lava solidifies, it becomes uniformly magnetized in the direction in which the Earth' s magnetic field points. There are significant differences in the direction of magnetization among solidified lava flows from different volcanoes that erupted at different times over the past several million years. Ttherefore, it must be that the direction of the Earth' s magnetic field has changed over time. Since lava flows differing by thousands of years in age often have very similar directions of magnetization, the change in the direction of the Earth' s magnetic field must take place very gradually over hundreds of thousands of years. The argument that the direction of the Earth's magnetic field has changed over time requires the assumption that A: not all solidified lava has changed the direction of its magnetization unpredictably B: only lava can be used to measure the direction of the Earth's magnetic field as it existed in the distant past C: as lava flows down the side of a volcano, it picks up magnetized rocks D: a single volcano can produce lava of differing consistencies during different eruptions Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"A"},{"prompt":"Electrical engineers have repeatedly demonstrated that the best solidstate amplifiers are indistinguishable from the best vacuumtube amplifiers with respect to the characteristics commonly measured in evaluating the quality of an amplifier' s musical reproduction.

The court analyst's reasoning is flawed because it fails to take into account that A: experts may agree that the tests are highly reliable while disagreeing about exactly how reliable they are B: there are also controversies about reliability of evidence in noncriminal cases C: the standard against which evidence in a criminal case is measured should not be absolute certainty D: data should not be admitted as evidence in a court of law without scientific witnesses having agreed about how reliable they are Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"A"},{"prompt":"According to the bottomup theory of how ecosystems are structured, the availability of edible plants is what primarily determines an ecosystem' s characteristics since it determines how many herbivores the ecosystem can support, which in turn determines how many predators it can support. This theory also holds that a reduction in the number of predators will have little impact on the rest of the ecosystem. Which one of the following, if true, would provide evidence against the bottomup theory? A: In an effort to build up the population of a rare species of monkey on Vahique Island, monkeys were bred in zoos and released into the wild. However, the effort failed because the trees on which the monkeys fed were also nearly extinct. B: After many of the trees on Jaevix Island were cleared, the island's leafcutter ants, which require a forested ecosystem, experienced a substantial decrease in population, as did the island's anteaters. C: Plants that are a dietary staple of wild pigs on Sedif Island have flourished over the last three decades, and the population of the pigs has not changed much in spite of extensive hunting. D: After hunting virtually eliminated predators on Rigu Island, the population of many herbivore species increased more than tenfold, causing the density of plants to be dramatically reduced.

After all, twobyfours and twobysixes the sizes of lumber most commonly used in home construction are deteriorating in quality and increasing in cost, while environmentfriendly steel is decreasing in cost. In addition, unlike wood, steel will not warp, rot, or split. Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the builder's reasoning? A: Training home construction workers to work with steel is very costly. B: Steelframed homes do not have to be treated with pesticides or other chemicals that can contribute to indoor air pollution. C: Because lumber prices have increased over the last decade, currently most new homes are built with steel frameworks. D: The number of houses built each year is expected to decrease over the next decade.

To expect people to thrive when they are given the freedom to make unwise decisions is frequently unrealistic. Once people see the destructive consequences of extreme freedom, they may prefer to establish totalitarian political regimes that allow virtually no freedom. Thus, one should not support political systems that allow extreme freedom. Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the essayist's reasoning? A: One should not support any political system whose destructive consequences could lead people to prefer totalitarian political regimes. B: One should not support any political system that is based on unrealistic expectations about people's behavior under that system. C: One should not support any political system that will inevitably lead to the establishment of a totalitarian political regime. D: One should not expect everyone to thrive even in a political system that maximizes people's freedom in the long run.

This is because to succeed as a salesperson, one must first establish a strong client base, and studies have shown that anyone who spends at least three years developing a client base can eventually make a comfortable living in sales. The reasoning in the salesperson's argument is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to consider the possibility that A: it takes longer than three years for a salesperson to develop a strong client base B: a salesperson who has not spent three years developing a client base may not succeed in sales C: some salespeople require fewer than three years in which to develop a strong client base D: salespeople who have spent three years developing a client base might not yet be successful in sales Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"C"},{"prompt":"The success of a private university depends on the relative longterm success of its graduates. This is evident from the fact that unless the majority of a private university' s graduates are successful, it will be impossible for the graduates to donate large sums of money to their alma mater. It should be obvious that a private university is successful only if its graduates donate large amounts of money to it. The claim that a private university is successful only if its graduates donate large amounts of money to it plays which of the following roles in the argument? A: It is used to illustrate a consequence of the argument's conclusion. B: It is a claim that must be rebutted for the argument's conclusion to stand. C: It is the argument's conclusion.

A signal in a pure analog system can be infinitely detailed, while digital systems cannot produce signals that are more precise than their digital units. With this theoretical advantage there is a practical disadvantage, however. Since there is no limit on the potential detail of the signal, the duplication of an analog representation allows tiny variations from the original, which are errors. These errors tend to accumulate as signals are duplicated, until this noise obliterates the information embodied in the original signal. The statements above, if true, most strongly support which one of the following? A: Digital systems are the best information systems because error cannot occur in the emission of digital signals. B: Analog representation of information is impractical because we do not need infinitely detailed information. C: Many ideas that work well in theory do not work well in practice. D: Digital systems are preferable to analog systems when the signal must be reproduced many times.

The Dewyfresh advertisement exhibits which one of the following errors of reasoning? A: It relies on an analogy between two things that are insufficiently alike in the respects in which they would have to be alike for the conclusion to be supported. B: It treats something that is necessary for bringing about a state of affairs as something that is sufficient to bring about that state of affairs. C: It treats the fact that two things regularly occur together as proof that there is a single thing that its the cause of them both.

These results do not prove that education improves mathematical skills, however, since it is possible that students who have better mathematical skills to start with are the students who reach higher educational levels. The reasoning of the researcher's argument is most similar to that of which one of the following arguments? A: Results indicate that the quality of papers submitted for publication varies significantly from university to university. This may say nothing about the quality of education offered at different schools, but may only reflect a defect in the review process. B: Results from competition indicate that professional athletes outperform amateur athletes. These results do not prove that becoming a professional athlete improves one's athletic performance, since it is possible that the athletes who become professionals are those whose performance is better to begin with. C: Studies suggest that some people who are gifted in higher mathematics are inept at performing simple arithmetical calculations. These studies do not show that being good at mathematics precludes being good at arithmetic, since there are also many people who are good at both. D: Surveys indicate that politicians with law degrees are better at what they do than politicians without law degrees.

He and Greene were the only ones in a position to tell the press about the institute' s potentially embarrassing affiliations, but Greene had no reason to do so. Ttherefore, it must have been Keeler who notified the press. Which one of the following arguments is most closely parallel in its reasoning to the argument above? A: Cutter and Rengo are the only serious candidates for designing the new monument. Rengo has designed several beautiful monuments and has connections to the selection committee. Ttherefore, it will probably be Rengo who is awarded the job of designing the monument. B: Other than Helms and Lapinski, no one had access to the equipment on Thursday, the day it was tampered with. Thus, since Helms had reason to tamper with the equipment and Lapinski did not, it must have been Helms who did it. C: The only people who had any reason to write the anonymous letter were Johnson and Ringwold. Johnson and Ringwold both deny doing so. Ringwold, however, admits that she has written anonymous letters in the past. Thus, it must have been Ringwold who wrote the letter.

Which one of the following exhibits a pattern of reasoning that is most parallel to that used by the novelist? A: A banquet menu foretells the content of a meal, but some people collect menus in order to remind themselves of great meals they have eaten. Thus a banquet menu has a function not only before, but also after, a meal has been served. B: Watching a travelog is not the same as traveling.

It can be concluded from this that the new Malsenian converts to classical music, having initially experienced this music as recorded music, are most comfortable with classical music as recorded music and really have no desire to hear live performances. The argument assumes which one of the following? A: Classical concerts in Malsenia are not limited to music that is readily available on recordings. B: The classical records available in Malsenia are, for the most part, not recordings of actual public concerts.

When molten rocks crystallize, they display the polarity of Earth' s magnetic field at that time. But the recrystallized rocks recovered at the site display normal magnetic polarity, even though Earth' s magnetic field was reversed at the time of the mass extinction. Each of the following is an assumption on which Professor Robinson' s argument depends EXCEPT: A: The crater indicates an impact of more than sufficient size to have caused the mass extinction.

However, as part of its subsidiary businesses, the GFC has now invested in a program to replant significant parts of the coast with mangrove trees. Given income from a controlled harvest of wood with continuing replanting, the mangrove regeneration effort makes it more likely that the cooperative will increase its net income. Which of the following, if true, would most strengthen the argument that mangrove replanting will increase the Gocha cooperative's net income? A: A controlled harvesting of mangrove wood by the GFC would have little effect on coastal erosion. B: The GFC derives 10 percent of its revenue from saltproduction facilities in an area previously cleared of mangroves.

But voting is a sacred right in democracies, one that has always been exercised by voting in person and not by mail. Ttherefore, voting by mail should not be allowed, and the proposed amendment should be rejected. The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument A: presumes, without providing justification, that if citizens have always had a certain legal right, they will continue to have that right in the future B: presents an appeal to tradition as the only reason for rejecting the proposal C: presumes, without providing justification, that the right to vote is not violated unless elections are conducted solely by mail D: fails to consider the possibility that, even if it gains the power to do so, the city council might never require voting by mail Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"B"},{"prompt":"Wife: The work of the artist who painted the portrait of my grandparents 50 years ago has become quite popular lately, so the portrait has recently become valuable. But since these sorts of artistic fads fade rapidly, the practical thing to do would be to sell the portrait while it is still worth something, and thereby enable our daughter to attend the college she has chosen. Husband: How could you make such a suggestion? That painting is the only thing you own that belonged to your grandparents. I don' t think it' s a very good painting, but it has great sentimental value. Besides, you owe it to our daughter to keep it in the family as a link to her family' s past. Which one of the following principles, if established, does most to justify the husband's reply? A: Gifts offered as sentimental tokens of affection should not be accepted if the recipient intends to sell them later for profit. B: Providing one's children with an education is more important than providing them with material goods, even if the goods have sentimental value. C: It is more important for parents to provide their children with tangible links to the family's past than it is to enable them to attend the college of their choice.

The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following arguments? A: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. B: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Ttherefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.

However, the study' s methods have since been shown to be flawed, and no other studies have succeeded in demonstrating mammalian parthenogenesis. Thus, since parthenogenesis is known to occur in a wide variety of nonmammalian vertebrates, there must be something about mammalian chromosomes that precludes the possibility of parthenogenesis. A flaw in the reasoning of the argument is that the argument A: infers that a characteristic is shared by all nonmammalian vertebrate species merely because it is shared by some nonmammalian vertebrate species B: confuses a necessary condition for parthenogenesis with a sufficient condition for it C: takes for granted that something that has not been proven to be true is for that reason shown to be false D: assumes that the methods used in a study of one mammalian species were flawed merely because the study's findings cannot be generalized to all other mammalian species Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"C"},{"prompt":"Sonya: The government of Copeland is raising the cigarette tax.

However, a new type of analysis detected titanium in the ink of the famous Bible printed by Johannes Gutenberg and in that of another fifteenthcentury Bible known as B36, though not in the ink of any of numerous other fifteenthcentury books analyzed. This finding is of great significance, since it not only strongly supports the hypothesis that B36 was printed by Gutenberg but also shows that the presence of titanium in the ink of the purportedly fifteenthcentury Vinland Map can no longer be regarded as a reason for doubting the map' s authenticity. The reasoning in the passage is vulnerable to criticism on the ground that A: it is unreasonable to suppose that determination of the date and location of a document's printing or drawing can be made solely on the basis of the presence or absence of a single element in the ink used in the document B: if the technology that makes it possible to detect titanium in printing ink has only recently become available, it is unlikely that printers or artists in the fifteenth century would know whether their ink contained titanium or not C: the discovery of titanium in the ink of the Vinland Map must have occurred before titanium was discovered in the ink of the Gutenberg Bible and the B36 Bible D: the results of the analysis are interpreted as indicating that the use of titanium as an ingredient in fifteenthcentury ink both was, and was not, extremely restricted Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"D"},{"prompt":"began to spread across North America around 12, 000 years ago, as the climate became warmer.

The argument is most vulnerable to the criticism that A: for early inhabitants of North America the destruction of mastodons, woolly mammoths, and sabertoothed tigers might have had very different significance than the extinction of mammal species does for modern humans B: in calling the idea that humans once lived in harmony with nature a myth the argument presupposes what it attempts to prove C: the evidence it cites is consistent with the alternative hypothesis that the large mammals' extinction was a direct result of the same change in climate that allowed humans to spread across North America D: there might have been many other species of animals, besides mastodons, woolly mammoths, and sabertoothed tigers, that became extinct as the result of the spread of humans across North America Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"C"},{"prompt":"Citizen of Mooresville: Mooresville' s current city council is having a ruinous effect on municipal finances.

Overgrazing by the enormous population of rabbits now menaces the island' s agriculture. The government proposes to reduce the population by using a virus that has caused devastating epidemics in rabbit populations elsewhere.

Establishing a beehive or two near one' s garden ensures the presence of bees. Keeping bees is economical, however, only if the gardener has a use for homegrown honey. Thus, gardeners who have no use for homegrown honey will tend not to have beehives, so their gardens will fail to have excellent pollination. Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the reasoning of the argument? A: The argument fails to consider that bees might be present even in the absence of a particular condition that would ensure their presence. B: The argument confuses what is necessary for an abundance of fruits and vegetables with what is usually conducive to it. C: The argument confuses what is necessary for pollination to take place with what would guarantee that it takes place.

The principal objection is that most people lack the expertise for proper selfdiagnosis and might not seek medical help for more serious conditions in the mistaken belief that they have swimmer' s ear. Yet in a recent study, of 1, 000 people who suspected that they had swimmer' s ear, 84 percent had made a correct diagnosis a slightly better accuracy rate than physicians have in diagnosing swimmer' s ear. Thus, clearly, most people can diagnose swimmer' s ear in themselves without ever having to consult a physician. Which one of the following, if true, most undermines the conclusion? A: Cases in which swimmer's ear progresses to more serious infections are very rare. B: For many people who develop swimmer's ear, the condition disappears without medical or pharmaceutical intervention.

After all, if a recording sells well, it may be because some of the music on the recording is too trendy to be authentically underground; accordingly, many underground musicians consider it desirable for a recording not to sell well. But weak sales may simply be the result of the group' s incompetence. Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the music critic's argument? A: An underground rock group is successful as an underground group if the group is competent but its recordings nonetheless do not sell well. B: An underground rock group is unsuccessful as an underground group if it is incompetent or if any of its music is too trendy to be authentically underground, or both.

After all, excessive consumption of candy undeniably leads to such health problems as tooth decay, but no one seriously believes that candy eaters who get cavities should be able to sue candy manufacturers. The main point of the argument is that A: no one should feel it necessary to deny the scientifically wellestablished fact that longterm cigarette smoking can lead to health problems B: excessive consumption of candy will lead to health problems just as surely as longterm cigarette smoking will C: the fact that smokers' health problems can be caused by their smoking is not enough to justify holding tobacco companies either legally or morally responsible for those problems D: if candy manufacturers were held responsible for tooth decay among candy eaters then tobacco companies should also be held responsible for health problems suffered by smokers Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"C"},{"prompt":"Recently, many medical students have been enrolling in joint M.

Government inspectors found that the typical IV solutions used in this hospital had somewhat high concentrations of sodium and potassium, which were raising patients' blood pressure and taxing their kidneys. The government inspectors mandated lowering the sodium and potassium in these IV preparations, and threatened with a possible government fine. In compliance, the hospital lowered the sodium and potassium levels in the IV solutions to the correct levels. Nevertheless, patients on IV therapy at that hospital continued to have a high rate of health complications. Which of the following, if true, most helps to explain why acting on the government inspectors' recommendations failed to achieve its goal? A: When sodium and potassium levels in the blood fall below their baseline level, it can damage cells throughout the body by reverse osmosis.

Since the average peak humidity this August was three points higher than the average peak humidity last August, it follows that more energy was consumed in Millville this August than last August. Which one of the following arguments has a pattern of reasoning most similar to the one in the argument above? A: The amount of art supplies used in any of the Aesthetic Institute's 25 classes is directly proportional to the number of students in that class. Since in these classes the institute enrolled 20 percent more students overall last year than in the previous year, more art supplies were used in the institute's classes last year than in the previous year. B: The fees paid by a student at the Aesthetic Institute are directly proportional to the number of classes in which that student enrolls. Since the number of students at the Aesthetic Institute is increasing, it follows that the institute is collecting a greater amount if fees paid by students that it used to. C: The number of instructors employed by the Aesthetic Institute in any term is directly proportional to the number of classes offered in that term and also directly proportional to the number of students enrolled at the institute. Thus, the number of classes offered by the institute in any term is directly proportional to the number of students enrolled in that term. D: The number of new students enrolled at the Aesthetic Institute in any given year is directly proportional to the amount of advertising the institute has done in the previous year.

But lately, as interest in the topic has increased, parthenogenesis has been found in a variety of unexpected cases, including sharks and Komodo dragons. So the number of species that can reproduce through parthenogenesis must be increasing. The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument A: takes ignorance of the occurrence of something as conclusive evidence that it did not occur B: takes for granted that because one thing follows another, the one must have been caused by the other C: overlooks a crucial difference between two situations that the argument presents as being similar D: equates mere interest in a subject with real understanding of that subject Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"A"},{"prompt":"Astronaut: Any moon, by definition, orbits some planet in a solar system.

Such marshes often play crucial roles in purifying groundwater and there has been no scientific assessment of the marsh' s role in maintaining the quality of the city' s well water. The city should ttherefore block the proposed office complex pending such an assessment. The principle underlying the argument above is most similar to the principle underlying which one of the following arguments? A: Building a light rail line to serve the downtown core could involve cost overruns and expensive delays, but traffic congestion will become intolerable within ten years without a light rail line. A light rail line should ttherefore be built. B: Defective products can cost an appliance manufacturer millions of dollars because of product recalls and lawsuits. Yova Corporation's new line of appliances has not yet been thoroughly tested for defects. Thus, Yova should not bring its new line to market at this time. C: Building the new highway along the proposed northern route would inevitably damage an adjoining wilderness area. The highway would also cause environmental damage if it follows the proposed southern route, but it would not harm any wilderness areas. Thus, if the highway is built, it should be built on the southern route. D: A laboratory safety check of a portable grill requires a week of uninterrupted testing. The new portable grill has been at the testing lab for a week, but the testing could not begin until the paperwork arrived three days later.

While all builtin appliances and lighting in common areas are energy efficient, the landlord found, upon doing an inspection, many residents were using older portable heaters that are not very energy efficient. The landlord decided to send each resident a detailed letter about the electric energy consumption of these older portable heaters, recommending newer more energy efficient models that could be purchased at local stores. He hopes the letter will motivate enough residents to buy more energy efficient heaters. Which of the following, if true, would provide most support for the prediction that the landlord's letter will have its intended effect? A: Throughout the city, this same environmental agency threatened other landlords and business owners with fines for various reasons, and in almost every case, the concerned parties were able to make sufficient changes to avoid the fines. B: Those apartments in the building with southern exposure get abundant sunlight, which has a substantial warming effect, and many of those residents do not use portable heaters. C: This landlord owns six apartment buildings of varying sizes in the city, and at each of the other five, the average electrical consumption is at or below the citywide average for buildings of that size.

Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the conclusion as it is drawn in the argument? A: Candidates should not run for elected office if doing so would compel the candidates to compromise their principles. B: Voters should not support a candidate if that candidate is known to have accepted funding from private sources.

At this point the child, having obtained the desired goal, stops the problematic behavior, to the parent' s relief. This selfreinforcing pattern of misbehavior and accommodation is repeated with steadily increasing levels of misbehavior by the child. The cases described by the psychologist illustrate each of the following generalizations EXCEPT: A: Parents, by their choices, can inadvertently increase their child's level of misbehavior. B: A child can develop problematic behavior patterns as a result of getting what it wants. C: A child can unintentionally influence a parent's behavior in ways contrary to the child's intended goals. D: A child can get what it wants by doing what its parent doesn't want it to do.

This suggests that the firstyear students with high levels of spending on recreation could reduce that spending without increasing their anxiety or depression. Each of the following, if true, strengthens the psychiatrist's argument EXCEPT: A: The screening instruments used by the psychiatrist are extremely accurate in revealing levels of anxiety and depression among university students. B: At other universities, firstyear students reporting the highest levels of spending on recreation also show the same degree of anxiety and depression as do those reporting the lowest levels of such spending. C: Among adults between the ages of 40 and 60, increased levels of spending on recreation are strongly correlated with decreased levels of anxiety and depression.

However, the government agency responsible for tariffs rejected the company' s request on the grounds that the figurines are marketed as collector' s items rather than toys. Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the government agency's decision? A: The tariff classification of an item should depend primarily on how the item is marketed. B: Objects that are developed primarily to provide amusement should be subject to lower tariffs than other objects.

Since Mary' s parents would not do anything to cause their daughter to be unable to make new friends, they will not increase Mary' s allowance. Which of the following patterns of reasoning is most similar to that in the paragraph above? A: In school districts that use standardized tests, student achievement is lower than in other districts. Ttherefore, eliminating standardized tests will increase student achievements in these districts. B: Children who attend schools with diverse populations are more likely to participate in community service projects. Since diverse populations in schools lead to increased community service participation, then all schools should have diverse populations. C: If the new budget does not pass this election, a new school cannot be built to alleviate the overcrowding at the existing school. Voters will not continue to tolerate overcrowding at the existing school so the new budget will pass. D: Older children function less well at earlier hours than younger children.

Since vegetation converts carbon dioxide into oxygen, excessive vegetation would have depleted the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide helps the atmosphere retain the sun' s heat. Thus, if this carbon dioxide is depleted, the earth cools significantly, thereby causing an ice age. Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main conclusion of the scientist's argument? A: If unusually rich growth of vegetation caused the ice ages, it undoubtedly did so by depleting the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. B: An excessive growth of vegetation causes the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to be depleted.

This seems surprising since the phases of the moon do not affect how plants grow. An alternative practice often found among amateur gardeners is to plant during the first warm spell of spring, which leads to problems when a frost follows. So, amateur gardeners who use the phases of the moon are less likely to lose plants to a frost. The argument requires assuming which one of the following? A: Amateur gardeners who use the phases of the moon tend to plant different types of plants than do other amateur gardeners. B: Amateur gardeners cannot improve their results unless they understand why their methods work as they do. C: The phases of the moon affect whether a frost follows the first warm spell of spring.

Most animals exposed to a mirror respond only with social behavior, such as aggression. However, in the case of the great apes, repeated exposure to mirrors leads to selfdirected behaviors, such as exploring the inside of the mouth, suggesting that these animals recognize the reflection as an image of self. The implication of these studies is that the great apes have a capacity for selfawareness unique among nonhuman species. The cognitive scientist makes which of the following assumptions in the argument above? A: If an animal does not have the capacity for MSR, it does not have the capacity for selfawareness. B: When exposed to a mirror, all animals display either social behavior or selfdirected behavior. C: Animals that do not exhibit MSR may demonstrate a capacity for selfawareness in other ways.

Archaeological evidence reveals that compared to their huntergatherer forebears, the early agricultural peoples ate a poorly balanced diet and had dietrelated health problems, yet these peoples never returned to hunting and gathering. Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain why the agricultural peoples of western Asia never returned to hunting and gathering? A: Both huntergatherers and agriculturalists sometimes depended on stored and preserved foods instead of fresh foods. B: An increase in population density at the time required a higher food production rate than hunting and gathering could provide.

The reasoning in the argument above is most similar to the reasoning in which one of the following arguments? A: To be elected class president, one must be well liked and well known. Anyone who is well liked or well known has something better to do than run for class president. Ttherefore, no one who has something better to do will be elected class president. B: To get an executive position at Teltech, one needs a university diploma and sales experience. But anyone who has worked at Teltech for more than six months who does not have sales experience has a university diploma. Thus, one cannot get an executive position at Teltech unless one has worked there for six months. C: To get a discount on ice cream, one must buy frozen raspberries and ice cream together. Anyone who buys ice cream or raspberries will get a coupon for a later purchase. So, anyone who does not get the discount on ice cream will not get a coupon for a later purchase.

But because only a few eggs can be produced by a breeding pair over their lifetime, any significant increase in the number of birds depends upon most of these eggs hatching, which is extremely unlikely in the wild due to environmental dangers. One possible way to eliminate the effects of these factors is to breed the birds in captivity and subsequently return them to the wild. Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above? A: The condor as a species will eventually become extinct in the wild. B: It is almost impossible to eliminate all the environmental threats to the eggs of condors. C: The most feasible way to save the condor from extinction is to increase egg production.

But without realistic projections of financial obligations, a functional budget cannot be devised. So, if either fiscal security is to be obtained or a workable budget devised, finances must be managed wisely or financial obligations must be projected realistically. Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its pattern of reasoning to that in the argument above? A: Only employees who work diligently will be retained in this company until they are eligible for retirement. Also, we can retain only those employees who fit the new organizational structure of our proposed redesign process. So, if this redesign process is carried out, any employee who seeks continuing employment here must work diligently and fit the new organizational structure. B: Reasonably healthy people who wish to lose weight must alter their balance of caloric intake and caloric burn off. But without benefit of medical supervision, drastic changes in diet or exercise patterns would be harmful. So, one who wishes to lose weight but does not want to risk health problems should seek medical supervision before beginning a diet or exercise program. C: Without continued use of pesticides it is not possible to grow enough food for the world's people. But only when researchers develop pesticides harmless to humans will persistent health problems be reduced. Thus, pesticide use must continue or pesticides harmless to humans must be developed if enough food is to be produced or persistent health problems are to be reduced. D: A successful charity drive requires detailed planning. Volunteers must be recruited and trained, and equipment and facilities must be prepared months before the drive is to begin.

Not everyone participates in the national census, despite its being mandatory. If, however, census participation became voluntary, as some have proposed, the participation rate would be much lower. So if census participation became voluntary, polls designed to discover the opinions of the national population would have less accurate results. Which one of the following is an assumption on which the pollster's argument depends? A: Among people who do not currently participate in the national census, few, if any, would agree to participate if participation were voluntary. B: Using data from the national census is not the only way for opinion researchers to get a population sample that reflects the demographic characteristics of the national population. C: The group of people who would participate in a voluntary national census would differ in its demographic characteristics from the group of people who would participate in a mandatory national census.

Critics of the study, defending earlier research recommending one glass of wine daily, claim that binge drinkers (who drink once a week or less, but drink three or more drinks when they do drink) are the people most likely to drink three glasses of wine in one day and are more likely to die from sudden heart attacks than are other drinkers. According to these critics, drinking three glasses of wine daily would not benefit health overall, since the decrease in the risk of stroke associated with that level of consumption is negated by its associated increased risk of sudden heart attack. The critics' argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it A: inappropriately attributes the consequences of binge drinking to persons whose regular consumption of wine is three glasses a day B: presumes, without providing justification, that there is no significant difference between wine and other alcoholic beverages in terms of health benefits and risks C: confuses the risk of sudden alcoholinduced heart attacks with other health risks D: fails to address specifically the reduction in risk of stroke conferred by the level of consumption in the recent study Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"A"},{"prompt":"Though sucking zinc lozenges has been promoted as a treatment for the common cold, research has revealed no consistent effect. Recently, however, a zinc gel applied nasally has been shown to greatly reduce the duration of colds. Since the gel contains zinc in the same form and concentration as the lozenges, the greater effectiveness of the gel must be due to the fact that cold viruses tend to concentrate in the nose, not the mouth. Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument? A: Experimental subjects who used the zinc gel not only had colds of shorter duration but also had less severe symptoms than did those who used a gel that did not contain zinc. B: Drugcompany researchers experimenting with a nasal spray based on zinc have found that it has much the same effect on colds as the gel does.

This difference shows that research projects conducted by international research teams are of greater importance than those conducted by single researchers. Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends? A: International research teams tend to be more generously funded than are single researchers. B: It is possible to ascertain whether or not a paper is the product of international collaboration by determining the number of citations it has received. C: The number of citations a paper receives is a measure of the importance of the research it reports.

After all, Mozart was writing at a time when the performer was expected, as a matter of course, not just to interpret but to modify the written score. Alberto adopts which one of the following strategies in criticizing Edwina's position? A: He attacks her judgment by suggesting that she does not recognize the importance of the performer's creativity to the audience's appreciation of a musical composition. B: He defends a competing view of musical authenticity. C: He appeals to an academic authority in order to challenge the factual basis of her conclusion.

However, environmentalists contend that the recent rash of serious oil spills and accidents at petrochemical plants is traceable to costcutting measures. Which of the following, if true, would provide the strongest support for the position held by industry officials? A: There is evidence that the most damaging of the recent oil spills would have been prevented had costcutting measures not been instituted. B: The petrochemical industry benefits if accidents do not occur, since accidents involve risk of employee injury as well as loss of equipment and product. C: Despite major cutbacks in most other areas of operation, the petrochemical industry has devoted more of its resources to environmental and safety measures in the last five years than in the preceding five years. D: Both the large fines and adverse publicity generated by the most recent oil spills have prompted the petrochemical industry to increase the resources devoted to oilspill prevention. Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"C"},{"prompt":"The goal of reforesting degraded land is to create an area with a multitude of thriving tree species.

Since the fares collected during these periods are less than the cost of providing the service, these cuts would reduce the deficit and should be made. Transit law prohibits unauthorized fare increases, and fareincrease authorization would take two years. Ping: Such service cuts might cost the PTA more in lost fares than they would save in costs, for the PTA would lose those riders who leave home during the day but must return late at night. Thus the PTA would lose two fares, while realizing cost savings for only one leg of such trips. The relationship of Ping's response to Winston's argument is that Ping's response A: carefully redefines a term used in Winston's argument B: questions Winston's proposal by raising considerations not addressed by Winston C: introduces detailed statistical evidence that is more persuasive than that offered by Winston D: supplies a premise that could have been used as part of the support for Winston's argument Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"B"},{"prompt":"The word loophole is a loaded, partisan word, one that implies wrongdoing and scandal.

Hence the psychiatrist who released tapes of a poet' s therapy sessions after the poet' s death violated his oath by his actions, even though the tapes were released after the poet' s death and to the poet' s official biographer. It makes no difference that the poet' s published works were written in a confessional manner or that she had assured the psychiatrist that he could do with the tapes as he saw fit. Bonara: 1 agree that doctors are bound not to divulge patient information and would not myself release such tapes without written permission from the patient. Nevertheless, I disagree that the circumstances were irrelevant in this case. I do not think the poet' s psychiatrist violated the Hippocratic oath. Which one of the following principles, if established, helps most to justify Scott's evaluation of the psychiatrist's actions? A: If a patient has expressed an intention to make public information about himself or herself that is in a psychiatrist's possession, the psychiatrist is released from the obligation to keep that information confidential. B: Since any psychiatrist's divulging to the public information about a patient could undermine the trust of other patients in their psychiatrists, no patient can release a psychiatrist from the obligation to keep patient information confidential. C: Since a psychiatrist could influence a patient's opinions during therapy, any directives to the psychiatrist by the patient must be interpreted in the light of the patient's actions outside the therapeutic setting.

Supporting evidence is an extraterrestrial chemical element in a layer of dust found worldwide at a geological level laid down contemporaneously with the supposed event. A new competing theory contends that any asteroid impact was irrelevant, because it was massive volcanic activity that caused the extinctions by putting enough dust into the atmosphere to cool the planet. The Deccan region of India contains extensive volcanic flows that occurred within the same time period as the supposed asteroid impact and the extinctions. The new theory assumes that A: the massive volcanic activity was not caused by the impact of an asteroid B: the extinctions took place over a longer time period than they would have if caused by the impact of an asteroid C: no individual dinosaurs survived the impact of the asteroid, if it occurred D: it is not possible to determine which would have occurred first, the volcanic flows in the Deccan region or the supposed impact of an asteroid Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"A"},{"prompt":"Chronic back pain is usually caused by a herniated or degenerated spinal disk. In most cases the disk will have been damaged years before chronic pain develops, and in fact an estimated one in five people over the age of 30 has a herniated or degenerated disk that shows no chronic symptoms. If chronic pain later develops in such a case, it is generally brought about by a deterioration of the abdominal and spinal muscles caused by insufficient exercise. The statements above, if true, most strongly support which one of the following? A: Four out of five people over the age of 30 can be sure they will never develop chronic back pain. B: Doctors can accurately predict which people who do not have chronic back pain will develop it in the future. C: People who exercise their abdominal and spinal muscles regularly are sure to be free from chronic back pain.

Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"D"},{"prompt":"A neighborhood group plans to protest the closing of the neighborhood' s only recreation center on the grounds that to do so would leave the neighborhood without local access to a recreation center. Our neighborhood already has the most residents per center of any neighborhood in the city, complained one resident, and closing this center would make the situation unacceptable since access to recreational facilities is a necessity for this neighborhood. Each of the following, if true, weakens the resident's argument EXCEPT: A: Programs that are routinely filled at other recreation centers must be canceled at the neighborhood's recreation center due to lack of interest. B: As people become more involved in computers and computer games, recreation centers are becoming increasingly less important. C: A large number of the neighborhood's residents are unable to travel outside their locality to gain access to recreational facilities. D: Often the recreation center in the neighborhood is open but not being used.

This is why we can remember long strings of information or text, which would normally be impossible to memorize, when they are put to music. Given that music aids memory, it might seem that funny jokes would be easy to remember, since, like music, they normally elicit an emotional response in us. However, jokes are usually very difficult to remember, since . __. Which one of the following most logically completes the passage? A: for most people, certain memories elicit a strong emotional response B: people can hold in shortterm memory only a few chunks of unpattemed information at a time C: jokes work not by conforming to repeated patterns but by breaking them D: jokes, unlike music, always have content that is verbal or at least clearly symbolic Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"C"},{"prompt":"Statistical records of crime rates probably often reflect as much about the motives and methods of those who compile or cite them as they do about the actual incidence of crime. The police may underreport crime in order to convey the impression of their own success or overreport crime to make the case for a budget increase. Politicians may magnify crime rates to get elected or minimize them to remain in office. Newspapers, of course, often sensationalize crime statistics to increase readership. The argument proceeds by doing which one of the following?

Secretions of these millipedes have been shown to contain two chemicals that are potent mosquito repellents, and mosquitoes carry parasites that debilitate the capuchins. The rubbing behavior is rare except during the rainy season, when mosquito populations are at their peak. Ttherefore, the monkeys probably rub the millipedes into their fur because doing so helps protect them against mosquitoes. Which of the following would it be most useful to determine in order to evaluate the argument? A: Whether the two chemicals provide any protection for the millipedes against their own predators B: Whether animals other than capuchins rub insects of any kind into their fur C: Whether the type of millipede used by the capuchin monkeys in Venezuela is found in other parts of the world D: Whether the only time the millipedes are readily available to the capuchins is during the rainy season Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"D"},{"prompt":"Many people think that the only way to remedy the problem of crime is by increasing the number of police officers, but recent statistics show that many major cities had similar ratios of police officers to citizens, yet diverged widely in their crime rates.

A: Our notion of fashion trends will probably be accurate if we rely on TV fashion programs, despite the fact that these programs deliberately select the most outrageous outfits in order to get the viewers' attention. B: Our view of preprintingpress literature can never be accurate, because the surviving works of ancient authors are those that were deemed by copyists most likely to be of interest to future readers. C: Our memory of 1960s TV shows could hardly be improved, because so many of the television programs of the era are still rerun today.

At that time, a typical claim took six months to process and clear. In response to this high number, the CEO' s Advisory Team published a comprehensive set of guidelines for training employees in the identification and avoidance of behaviors that could constitute sexual harassment. At this writing, the human resources department has only sixty sexual harassment cases open. Clearly, the guidelines published by the CEO' s Advisory Team were effective in reducing the occurrence of new sexual harassment claims at Harrison' s Technologies. Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the conclusion above? A: The human resources department at Anthony Information Industries, a principal rival of Harrison's with a similar number of employees, opened no new sexual harassment claims in the past year. B: New paperwork and procedure, also introduced two years ago, has allowed the human resources department at Harrison's Technologies to process and close almost all new claims of sexual harassment in less than one month. C: The majority of sexual harassment claims lead to the termination of employees found guilty; new employees hired to fill these positions need to be trained in the guidelines.

Although some of the craters contain rocks that have undergone highpressure shocks characteristic of meteorites slamming into Earth, these shocks could also have been caused by extreme volcanic events. Because of the linearity of the craters, it is very unlikely that some of them were caused by volcanoes and others were caused by meteorites. Thus, since the craters are all different ages, they were probably caused by volcanic events rather than meteorites. Which one of the following statements, if true, would most strengthen the argument? A: No known natural cause would likely account for eight meteorite craters of different ages forming a straight line. B: A similar but shorter line of craters that are all the same age is known to have been caused by volcanic activity.

Most parents support this measure and argue that making classes smaller allows teachers to devote more time to each student, with the result that students become more engaged in the learning process. However, researchers who conducted a recent study conclude from their results that this reasoning is questionable. The researchers studied schools that had undergone recent reductions in class size, and found that despite an increase in the amount of time teachers spent individually with students, the students' average grades were unchanged. Which one of the following is an assumption required by the researchers' argument? A: The only schools appropriate for study are large elementary schools. B: Teachers generally devote the same amount of individualized attention to each student in a class. C: Parental support for the proposed law rests solely on expectations of increased student engagement in the learning process.

In many years insect pollinators are scarce, and in those years a typical nonselfpollinating primrose produces fewer seeds than does a typical selfpollinating primrose. In other years, seed production is approximately equal. Thus, selfpollinating primroses have the advantage of higher average seed production. Aside from seed production, these selfpollinating primroses are indistinguishable from nonselfpollinating primroses. Nevertheless, selfpollinating primrose plants remain rare among primroses. Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy in the information above? A: Selfpollinating primroses that are located in areas with few insects produce no fewer seeds than do selfpollinating primroses that are located in areas with many insects.

Their feeding methods were limited to either sucking in surface plankton or sucking in food particles from bottom mud. With the development of biting jaws, however, the life of fishes changed dramatically, since jaws allowed them actively to pursue prey, to seize it in their jaws, and to manipulate it between their teeth. The jawed fishes then developed along two main lines: one retained cartilage for its skeletons, for example, sharks and rays; the other adopted bone as its principal skeletal material. From the latter group evolved the most abundant and diverse of all of today' s vertebrate groups, the teleosts, some 21, 000 species, which vary from barracudas to sea horses.

The two books, although set in different periods and regions, contain enough plot similarities to make coincidental resemblance unlikely. Mikkeli' s defense rests on his argument that plagiarism was impossible in this case because Halden' s book has been published only in Norwegian, a language Mikkeli does not understand, and because no reviews of Halden' s book have ever been published. The argument in Mikkeli's defense depends on the assumption that A: nobody related the plot of Halden's book in detail to Mikkeli before Mikkeli wrote his book B: there is a common European myth to which both authors referred subconsciously in the books in question C: Mikkeli is not familiar with Old Icelandic, an extinct language related to an earlier form of Norwegian D: Mikkeli has never met Halden Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"A"},{"prompt":"CEO: We have been falsely criticized for not being an environmentally responsible corporation. Environmentally responsible corporations are corporations that do all they can to pollute less. Our current production methods pollute significantly less than our old methods did, and there currently are no methods that do not produce any pollution. The reasoning in the CEO's argument is flawed in that it A: ignores the possibility that there are currently production methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now B: generalizes too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms C: takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed D: takes for granted that because the company has attempted to reduce the amount of pollution produced, they must have succeeded Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"A"},{"prompt":"Any driver involved in an accident leading to personal injury or property damage exceeding 500 is legally required to report the accident to the department of motor vehicles, unless the driver is incapable of doing so.

An alternative explanation is that by age forty most scientists have worked in their field for fifteen or more years and that by then they have exhausted the opportunity for creative work in that field. Supporting this explanation is the finding that __. Which of the following most logically completes the passage? A: a disproportionately large number of the scientists who produce highly creative work beyond age forty entered their field at an older age than is common B: the average age of recipients of scientific research grants is significantly greater than forty C: many scientists temper their own expectations of what they can achieve in their research work by their belief that their creativity will decline as they age D: scientists who are older than forty tend to find more satisfaction in other activities, such as teaching and mentoring, than they do in pursuing their own research Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"A"},{"prompt":"1988, a significant percentage of seals in the Baltic Sea died from viral diseases; off the coast of Scotland, however, the death rate due to viral diseases was approximately half what it was for the Baltic seals. The Baltic seals had significantly higher levels of pollutants in their blood than did the Scottish seals. Since pollutants are known to impair marine mammals' ability to fight off viral infection, it is likely that the higher death rate among the Baltic seals was due to the higher levels of pollutants in their blood. Which one of the following, if true, provides the most additional support for the argument? A: The kinds of pollutants found in the Baltic Sea are significantly different from those that have been detected in the waters off the coast of Scotland. B: The strain of virus that killed Scottish seals overwhelms impaired immune systems much more quickly than it does healthy immune systems. C: The large majority of Scottish seals that died were either old or unhealthy animals.

Clearly, the only effective way to reduce significantly their overall incidence is to halt industries known to produce these pollutants, given that such industries are unlikely to comply adequately with strict environmental regulations. A flaw in the activist's reasoning is that it A: fails to consider whether industries may voluntarily decrease their output of pollutants B: takes for granted that certain effects can be produced independently by several different causes C: fails to consider the possibility that chemicals now classified as pollutants have some beneficial effects not yet discovered D: fails to consider the possibility that a significant number of occurrences of cancer and birth defects may be caused by preventable factors other than industrial pollutants Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"D"},{"prompt":"Doubleblind techniques should be used whenever possible in scientific experiments.

The researchers hypothesized that this emotion noticeably affects the sound of the singing. To test this hypothesis the parents were recorded while singing to their infants and while singing with no infant present. They were instructed to make the two renditions as similar as possible. These recordings were then played for psychologists who had not observed the recordings being made. For 80 percent of the recordings, these psychologists were able to correctly identify, by listening alone, which recordings were of parents singing to their children. The researchers concluded that their hypothesis was correct. Which one of the following, if true, would most strengthen the researchers' reasoning? A: Most of the parents who participated in the study believed that the emotion they felt while singing to their infants affected their singing. B: Parents displayed little emotion when singing with no child or adult present. C: When a person feels emotion, that emotion provokes involuntary physiological responses that affect the vocal cords and lungs.

This was because early typewriters would jam frequently if adjacent keys were struck in quick succession. Experiments have shown that keyboard configurations more efficient than QWERTY can double typing speed while tremendously reducing typing effort. However, the expense and inconvenience of switching to a new keyboard configuration prevent any configuration other than QWERTY from attaining widespread use. Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the historian's statements? A: If the keyboard had been designed for computers, then it would not have been designed to limit typing speed. B: The benefit to society that would result from switching to a keyboard configuration other than QWERTY is significantly greater than the overall cost of such a switch. C: Most people who have tried typing with non QWERTY keyboards have typed significantly more quickly using those keyboards than they usually have done using QWERTY keyboards.
