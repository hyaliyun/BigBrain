There is also an 8-megapixel selfie camera sensor at the front along with dual LED flash. The ISP inside the Helio G70 supports a single 48MP camera (Quad Bayer) or two 16MP cams (the second could be ultra wide, tele, macro, whatever the maker fancies). Depth maps can be calculated in hardware and there is NeuroPilot for AI tasks (object and scene recognition, bokeh enhancement). Besides the storage, another thing that may limit this chip’s use in mid-range models is the 1080p/60fps cap on video capture. Goodies like EIS and rolling shutter correction are on board, however.

That’s kind of the point. And if a band or musician does grow a large mainstream audience? Then one must assume they are no longer punk, correct? This is why Kurt Cobain intentionally made the followup album to “Nevermind” a distorted, sparsely recorded collection of extended screams for “In Utero”. Even the name of the LP is rather disconcerting and leaves you with a foul taste in your taste. Yet, even amongst the howls and angst, there is “All Apologies” and “Dumb” and “Pennyroyal Tea” — which touch upon true beauty and actual art and provide melodies like few other tunes from the same time period. Or in other words, even when Cobain was trying to be anti-social, ugly, and apathetic, he couldn’t help writing some really poignant timeless tunes. And what exactly is “punk rock”? It all depends on who you ask. Some will point to the first time feedback was intentionally recorded on a widely released LP with the Who’s “Anyway Anyhow Anywhere” or the first instance of a rock musician destroying his equipment a’la Pete Townsend from the same band, or the amazing garage rock surge that took place worldwide in the mid- and late-60s when teenagers realized there was no better way to meet girls than standing on a stage playing barre chords.Some believe it began and ended with the Sex Pistols and their brief plane wreck of an existence.Some think The Stooges created it, the Ramones and Clash perfected it, and the New Wave genre killed it for good more than forty years ago.Some think every band already mentioned didn’t even come close to being punk and point to the (at times unlistenable) frenzied sounds of hardcore, straight edge, and thrashcore in the abrasive offerings of Crass, Agnostic Front, GBH, 7 Seconds, Black Flag, Husker Du, and then the Cro-Mags, DRI, S.O.B., and Hellnation.Some think it’s a regional thing and believe it was born and died in the UK — or that it arose from the ashes of the Hippy and Folk Singer genres on the West Coast of the United States via bands like The Dead Kennedys, X, The Germs, T.S.O.L., and The Minutemen, or sprang from the Ronald Reagan-inspired rage emanating from Bad Brains and Minor Threat in Washington D.C. or was created like a Frankenstein in one single dumpy club in the N.Y. bowery (CBGBs).Some think Green Day and Blink-182 and Rancid were punk and you can almost hear the Gen-Xers who grew up in the 80s snickering like snarky hyenas.Some think punk rock was personified by those who had never heard the words “punk rock” in the form of lo-fi yet innovative trailblazers like The Velvet Underground, MC5, the New York Dolls, The Stranglers, and Television.Some believe punk was at its best in those artists from neighboring genres like The Misfits (horror rock), The Pogues (Celtic folk), Uncle Tupelo (alt-country), The Cramps (rockabilly), Parliament (funk), Bauhaus (goth), The Gun Club (blues), Roxy Music (glam), and Motorhead (metal).Some say it’s been dead for decades and point to mass-produced Ramones-emblazened t-shirts, the mainstreaming of skate culture, the raw anger and previously unseen black social commentary of rap and its increasing global influence since the 80s, and the MTV-ication of once alt-authentic bands like the Talking Heads, REM, and Soundgarten as indicators that punk was killed by its own unsuspecting televised popularity, almost in spite of itself. And some, like myself, believe that as long as there are idealistic young people out there who can plug in a guitar and keep a 4/4 beat on drums and have a nagging sense of urgency and who simply don’t fit in — anywhere — with any clique, social circle, or conformist dynamic — and who aren’t held down by sonic perfection, overly pedantic music theorizing, technically obsessed yet masturbatory approaches to performing, or some politically correct messaging, there will always be a form of “punk rock” being played in some basement, VFW hall, alley way, or hole in the wall club. How popular it is doesn’t matter. In fact, appealing to the masses is anathema to what punk rock should be and that’s a goddamn good thing. Because the best punk shows I ever saw were never in arenas or stadiums. They took place right in front of me, within spitting distance, and during every one of them, I swear, I would look behind me in disbelief, wondering where all the people were that weren’t there. All of those that were missing what I was hearing and feeling. And it would actually make me smile. Knowing I was on to something that they weren’t. Suckers."},{"prompt":"What is it like to be morbidly obese (BMI > 40)?","completion":"I was morbidly obese. Morbid obesity is a BMI higher than 40 or higher than 35 with a health issue related to obesity, like diabetes. Let me start saying I've been overweight almost my whole life. When I met my husband, I was considered obese (220lbs at 5 ft 3) and got pregnant. I want to add that my husband is not obese. He’s actually a body builder and still loved my rolls. He encouraged me to show my body to him and he made me comfortable with my skin. He’s a great man. Anyways, stayed the same weight. Had my kid and over a couple years ballooned to 285lbs. Let me add, I have never suffered from high blood pressure or diabetes. I didn’t have any medical issues or take medication. I didn’t feel miserable. I always got told to lose weight but no one ever told me how. I honestly didn’t understand I had to burn more calories than I consumed and also incorporate exercise. I’m not kidding. I did have a miscarriage. Can’t really say if it was weight related or not. Even small women can have miscarriages. But my miscarriage made me extremely depressed. Anyways, at my highest, my BMI was 50.5, so I was morbidly obese. We ended up moving states to get away from drama and stress. Just from moving states over a couple months my weight dropped 20lbs because we moved to Florida and were doing a lot more walking and exploring our new area. This wasn’t an intentional weight loss. Over a weeks’ time, I was waking myself up from sleep. I think I was waking up because I couldn't breathe. Extra weight can cause this. My husband’s new job offered health reimbursement if we joined a gym and I thought why not spend some time doing something my husband loves? He never forced me to go but loved spending time together. I ended up talking to the manager at GNC. He was a nutritionist. He explained my calories to me and explained how I could get more information online and showed me some protein I could drink before meals and as meal replacements. When I started to lose weight I was at 265lbs. I am now hovering at 185lbs. In total I have lost 100lbs. I am still considered obese with a BMI of 32-ish. Looking back I realize how out of control I was eating. Eating for comfort. Out of boredom. Eating until I was sick. I just was stuck and I didn’t know how to get out. I just didn't have the right tools. I feel so much better. I love shopping for cute clothes. Not having to worry if something isn't going to fit. I still have another 40lbs to be at a healthy BMI but I found out I am pregnant again. This time I am equipped with all the tools I need to stay healthy. Edit — thanks for all the upvotes everyone. I am 7 months pregnant and have gained weight during the pregnancy which i fully intend on losing. My obgyn did not advise for me to continue on my diet until after baby is born. even though i am still considered obese, all of my testing during pregnancy has came back perfectly thus far. Thanks again! Edit 2 - still in awe of all the upvotes! I delivered a healthy baby girl in October. i know being morbidly obese it would be harder to carry a pregnancy, and having surgery is even more of a risk. I will always be grateful for who I was, as it taught me I had enough will power to control my eating and learn healthy habits. I’ve lost about half of my pregnancy weight and now following a keto way of eating (I don’t like to call it a diet)"},{"prompt":"Who is the most powerful Marvel character in MCU?","completion":"Ego"},{"prompt":"What is your favorite guitar joke?","completion":"Not exactly a guitar joke: An anthropologist travels to a remote village to study the indigenous people. On stepping down from his bush-plane the first thing he notices is the sound of continuous drumming. He is introduced to the local tribesman who has been assigned to be his guide, and his first question is, “What is the reason for this drumming?” The guide’s eyes widen. He wags his finger at the anthropologist and says, “If drums stop — very bad!” The anthropologist asks, “But why?” The guide folds his arms over his chest and repeats, “If drums stop — very bad!” This continues day and night; the drumming never stops for a moment. But every time the anthropologist tries to find out more, the guide resolutely repeats, “If drums stop — very bad!” and refuses to say more. Days go by — weeks — the drumming relentless and unceasing, until the anthropologist thinks he will go insane. Finally one day, the drums suddenly stop! Everyone in the village gasps at the sudden silence. The guide turns white as a sheet. The anthropologist says, “What is it?! What does it mean?!?!” and the guide screams in horror: “BASS SOLO!!!!!!”"},{"prompt":"What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a nongeared twowheeler over a geared one?","completion":"Hello, I will answer this question in simple layman terms ADVANTAGES:- High fuel economy.Easy to ride in traffic.Relatively simple operation anybody can drive.Comfortable riding position.Large boot space.Low maintainance.Option for storage box near knees.Feels nimble like a bicycle with a motor .Usually compact in nature.Can easily go through tight spaces and small alleyways.Can be used to haul heavy loads.Seats are wide for the passenger.Option for built-in mobile phone charger .Comfortable for ladies wearing sarees and men wearing dhoti/lungi . DISADVANTAGES Low capacity engine .Low power output.No ABS.Has a tendency to skid .Bike has a control over you not the other way around .Cant be used for cruising .It is not built for highways .Very limited torque .Riding mountains can be a real challenge especially the descent.No visible engine braking .Limited only for urban use cant be used offroad.Cannot enjoy the twists and turns on a curvy road.Maximum top speed cant exceed 110 or 120 kmph.Very limited cosmetic and mechanical mods available. If you are a beginner at riding bikes these automatics are the best choice for you but once you learn the manual completely (no stalling and smoother shifts along with a good clutch control) you will definitely stick with geared motorcycles.

Unlike sexual reproduction, asexual reproduction only introduces genetic variation into the population if a random mutation in the organism's DNA is passed on to the offspring. Advantages of asexual reproduction The population can increase rapidly when the conditions are favourable. Only one parent is needed. It is more time and energy efficient as you don't need a mate. It is faster than sexual reproduction.

Huskies do not always do well without other dogs in the home. Huskies can be very stubborn and almost offensively aloof when they are moody.

Often, victims of such relationships suffer from the “I deserve it” mentality. Perhaps, they’ve tried every single way to find other supportive partners. However, leaving co-dependent patterns is never an easy business – not everybody can do it. Many victims of abusive relationships also think of their abusive partners as, “It’s better to be in this relationship than (insert some more abusive patterns here),” particularly when the environment around them has eroded their self-confidence. Loneliness and the desire to experience love Abusers are often experts in trapping their targets to believe that the targets have found their true loves. They can mirror everything about the targets in ways that the targets quickly give in and convince themselves that they are nothing without the abusers’ “help” and presence. Plus, they can sense whether a person is lonely or has suffered in previous relationships. Such things can make the victims confused whenever they want to leave the relationships that are already toxic to them. Often, victims tolerate the bad just so the abusers will start being kind to them the first time they meet. People around them have made their move-outs difficult Sometimes, not being able to leave the relationship doesn’t only involve the victims and the abusers. At some points, people around the victims have made it difficult to move out of toxic relationships. It’s either they mess around with the victims’ phones, mercilessly contact the victims’ other closest ones, or they fabricate stories about the victims that make everybody around the victims believe that they are the crazy and mentally unstable ones.

This is because Parliament voted by a huge majority(90%) to leave on that date. Parliament chose the date on which we left the EU after the PM invoked Article 50. In true tradition a bill to debate when we left the EU was a colourful one! When it came to the vote, the MPs voted to enact a default position of leaving on the 29/3/19. The bill then passed to the upper chamber (House of Lords) and they debated the bill and it was agreed upon without amendment and sent back to the MPs(House of Commons). The bill was then sent to the Queen(Head of State) to give that Bill royal ascent. This is important as its the moment it passes into Law! Its known as a Statute. Its a word for ratification and cannot be changed unless a new bill is put forward by a minister of the crown to be debated and goes through the same process as Article 50 did. The problem MPs would have is that its overturning the referemdem by the people who voted to leave. This would be political suicide for any political party who tried to change a peoples vote without asking them first…. If they actually agreed that is! After all the stupid arguments that have been used to keep us in the EU by vested interests they cannot overturn Law so we leave on the date prescribed. The so called deal which was voted down was never going to be accepted, it was a dead duck before it was put to MPs to vote on. The truth is she is wasting time to make it look like she has tried to secure a deal with the EU but in reality she has no intention of doing so unless its to her advantage or that of the people.

It’s how things were always done. It’s the same as calling a stick shift a “standard”. Even though automatics are more common now and manuals are getting hard to find. Tail draggers are much trickier to land. The wings point upward after you land, so they have a tendency to “porpoise” and lift off the ground as the tail wheel drops. Also, the center of gravity is pushing against the wheels, making it always want to “ground loop” or swap ends on the runway as you brake. Also, it can be difficult to see in front of the plane while taxiing. You’ll see tail draggers zigzag down a taxiway so the pilot can peek around the cowl as they go. Tricycle gear planes have a nose wheel. When they land the front end drops as the nose wheel comes down, so the wings decrease their pitch and make less lift. This helps landings “stick”. The disadvantage to tricycle gear is the increased drag of the nose wheel right up front there in the prop wash. This is eliminated with retractable gear, and is generally considered worth the compromise of having a plane that’s easier to land & taxi."},{"prompt":"What is the scope of forensic science in India?","completion":"Forensic Science is still a fairly new field in India and the truth is that there is not much scope for it as of now. Its importance has yet to be acknowledged fully and its proper practice is still yet to be implemented by various investigating officers or law enforcement agencies during investigations. The courses offered by universities and the eligibility of Government posts also seem to clash; academic wise, while several universities in India currently offer a Bachelor’s degree in Forensic Science, many of the forensic agencies do not consider such students to be eligible for such posts. So at the end of the day, an individual pursuing forensic science can either take up teaching or work in FSLs by preparing for competitive exams or work for private organisations. However, while there are forensic bodies such as the central and state forensic laboratories functioning, the recruitment are subjected to the availability or vacancies of the posts, which are rarely released. The pay scale of such posts are also low and should be taken into consideration. Forensic science currently does not have a well developed structure or foundation in the country. The academic curriculum well as the Government jobs and their eligibility requirements are still not properly defined and is yet to be a full fledged system. Therefore, at the moment, Forensic science as a career, does not have a good scope in India.

In 2015, 2017 and 2019 they lost for many reasons: People still remembered what they did last timeThey threw themselves to the extreme left with a manifesto that promised even greater reckless spending that last time and a full commitment to open door immigrationFinally, they would not take a credible position on Brexit, a matter that was absolutely pivotal in the 2019 electionThey basically became an unelectable joke. At the same time, it is important to note, the Conservatives morphed into the new party of the working class with tax raids (though sensible ones) on the rich and tax breaks for the less well off (such and doubling the personal allowance). They also took a firm stance on Brexit and immigration. So whilst Labour certainly lost the election on their own, it must be remembered that the Conservatives comprehensively won it on their own.

If there is something that needs to be done and I can’t get to it I will ask for him to do it, or for him to watch the kids so I can do it. My husband is one of those people that can’t sit still, so he is pretty good at pitching in with the chores. He does yard work and folds his laundry (I don’t fold the “military way”, so he does it himself. He grills when I buy dinner that is best cooked that way. The toddler will sometimes prefer me since I am the one home with her the most so there are times when I would like to do household tasks but she is clinging to me and so he will do it instead. But right now her favorite game is being carried around in a laundry basket and he has way more muscles than I do, so that is a better game for him. The older child is his step-daughter but for whatever reason she prefers him to help with bike riding, so sometimes he will take her out. Her father is her t-ball coach, so twice a week he takes her to practice and then out to dinner and he has her overnight once a week, and that can lighten the load a bit. My husband travels for work sometimes and does military training. Sometimes I do get jealous, such as when he is gone for 3–4 days, gets to eat out, have a hotel room with a hot tub, etc. But during military training last month he had to go 2 weeks without a shower, clean laundry, etc, so I certainly got the better end of the deal that time."},{"prompt":"Why is it said that asexual reproduction doesn't lead to evolution because of less variations, even though humans evolved from microbes?","completion":"In asexual reproduction (similar to clone) genetic make up remains exactly same ( due to mitosis) which cannot produce any variation, essential for Natural Selection to work.

Compare a BBC broadcast with the nightly national news and you'll probably notice these differences: “If it bleeds, it leads” is not a thing in British journalism.Vocabulary matters. Sentences tend to be longer, and the range of vocabulary wider.The only words that tend to get mispronounced are foreign place names, but that's a long standing problem. It's not uncommon in American TV journalism for a broadcaster to encounter a word they've never heard before, and to mangle it on air. Local news in the US, is usually a step down from national news in terms of quality. In the LA area, the news usually includes car chases. I think this all started with OJ Simpson's long, slow car chase. Network news stories tend to be less than 5 minutes in length (you have to fit in the requisite number of drug ads). And don't usually answer all of the 5 basic questions of good journalism: who, what, when, where, and why. Background in a story that usually explains the “why\\", tends to be left out.

I tipped to Swanwick likely being Martian Manhunter in MoS. Not because in the last 20–30 years J’onn has chosen a Black American as his alter, but because there were subtle hints. I’m ok with it at the end, if that was in Snyder’s original rough cut. What I didn’t like was after the excellent call of Lois and Martha speaking in Lo’s apartment—it changed the whole tone of the scene—the reveal that this was MM. It cheapened a good scene. The last epilogue bothered me for 2 reasons. Obviously the 3–4 minutes shot for this had to do with Joker. But we are left with a cliff hanger—a dick move when both Snyder and the studio say he’s done. It felt like a call to arms for the release the cut brigade. And with mentioning the multiverse the question is then, are these even the character from Snyderverse or is only Batman, who has been jumping ‘verses to save Lois. As a bonus, it really made me want a Batfleck and Loker movie. Any Joker after Ledger would have a rough row to hoe. Ayres has already said Leto got screwed in the edit and their were scenes that would have made the Fauxker look like nothing. Leto deserves an Ayers cut, another movie with Bats by Afleck. And Snyder introduced it. Whether or not he gets to do it, it is out there. People think because I disliked MoS and BvS for very specific reasons are very narrow. The Snyder-please subscribe to HBO Max, is not what he would have been released. I’m not a fan of ‘17, although we started rewatching and at first it hung together very well. I know it’s gonna crap the bed, but the pacing was great, better color-timing. What I want is a Snyder-Joss cut, where they take Snyder’s everything but the kitchen sink, and Whedon’s ability to kill your darlings, and it would have been one for the ages. But even if they just hired the best editor they could to work with Snyder on pacing, how to show not tell, it would have been a better movie. Neither as is will age well. I like Snyder, but straight up good-guy heroes isn’t his strength—The Watchmen was a deconstruction of the form and it worked. People want better from DC in general. And Steppenwolf was overly CGI’d. I give ’17 s 2.5 on a scale of 1–5, Snyder a 3.5."},{"prompt":"What do you think about the new Marvel comics characters Safespace, Snowflake, Trailblazer, B Negative and Screentime from “The New Warriors?”","completion":"What, no mention of their preferred pronouns and sexual orientation?

I’m fifteen, nearly sixteen, but I can’t seem to find any images from when I was ten. Oh well, I’ll give this a shot anyway. Age 11: I’m on the left. My parents got divorced that year, and I snooped around and found out the reason why even though I wasn’t old enough to understand. Age 12: That’s my brother next to me. Can you see why everyone kept assuming I was adopted? Age 13: Oh man… I was so edgy at that age. I know the ponies kind of contradict that, but seriously, my boyfriend was a hardcore drug user and I was known at school for being violent. Age 14: Can you spot the girl photobombing this picture? She’s my girlfriend now. :) Age 15 I guess I became too cool to smile. Or brush my hair. Now (nearly 16): Well… I guess that counts as a smile? I don’t even know. I’m weird. Throughout the series of pictures, though not obvious, I am getting more and more depressed. I start self-harming at age 11, and by age 13 it has completely taken over my life. I get pulled out of school at age 14 and sent for psychiatric evaluation because I’m deemed too dangerous to be in school. I’m nearly committed to a permanent facility for mental disorders. Every year I fear growing older. I fear my age going up another number. I was absolutely determined not to live to be 16. I guess I’m still here though. Edit: I've been 16 for a while, so…. How am I doing? Well, my earlier prediction was right. Tomorrow I start my first day at a psychiatric hospital and I'm going to be there for a few weeks.

Similarly, when the server sends a response back to the client, it first goes through the proxy server, which then forwards the response to the client. The primary function of a proxy server is to provide a layer of abstraction and control between the client and the server. By acting as an intermediary, a proxy server can provide various benefits such as improved security, privacy, and performance.Now there are many successful proxy servers on the market, morelogin is one of them, which I have used and feel quite good."},{"prompt":"Blood Meridian, McCarthy describes a beheading as resulting in two ribbons or spouts or fountains of blood shooting up.

Here are some general strategies that can help control blood sugar levels: 1. Healthy Eating: Follow a balanced diet that includes a variety of nutrient-rich foods, such as whole grains, lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats. Focus on portion control and avoid foods high in refined sugars and carbohydrates. 2. Carbohydrate Management: Be mindful of carbohydrate intake and spread it evenly throughout the day. Choose complex carbohydrates that have a slower impact on blood sugar levels, such as whole grains, legumes, and non-starchy vegetables. 3. Regular Physical Activity: Engage in regular exercise as it can help improve insulin sensitivity and assist in blood sugar control. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week, along with strength training exercises. 4. Weight Management: Maintain a healthy weight or work towards achieving a healthy weight if overweight. Weight loss, if necessary, can improve blood sugar control and reduce the risk of developing diabetes. 5. Stay Hydrated: Drink an adequate amount of water throughout the day. Avoid sugary beverages, as they can cause blood sugar spikes. 6. Medications and Insulin: If prescribed by a healthcare professional, take diabetes medications or insulin as directed to help manage blood sugar levels. Follow the prescribed dosage and timing carefully. 7. Regular Monitoring: Monitor blood sugar levels regularly to track patterns and adjust management strategies as needed. Work closely with a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate frequency and method of monitoring. 8. Stress Management: Chronic stress can affect blood sugar levels. Practice stress management techniques such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, or engaging in activities you enjoy to help reduce stress. 9. Get Sufficient Sleep: Aim for seven to nine hours of quality sleep each night. Inadequate sleep can affect blood sugar control and insulin sensitivity. 10. Regular Medical Check-ups: Regularly visit your healthcare professional for check-ups, screenings, and to discuss your diabetes management plan. They can provide guidance, monitor your condition, and make necessary adjustments to your treatment plan.

She started being sick a couple of weeks ago by throwing up and peeing everywhere. I don’t want to put her down. Will the veterinarian let me put my cat down even if she is not sick?","completion":"How to put a Cat to Sleep It starts with deciding whether there is a need to put the cat to sleep. Take into consideration everything to do with the cat’s quality of life.It is wise to psychologically preparing oneself for the process of bidding the pet goodbye. It helps in grieving the loss with much ease. Petting, comforting and spending more time with the pet in its last moments is highly recommended.It is worth planning for the best way to end the pet’s life. It is I such instance that doing the euthanasia at home is considered one of the best ways. The process becomes even better if a veterinarian well explains it.The choice of how to dispose of the body of the cat pet once the euthanasia process is done is worth consideration. Some pet owners prepare special boxes, wrappers or a room.Prepare ample space at home where the euthanasia process is to be conducted. Most pet owners count the much fees paid here as the value they had attached to their pet.Ensure that the euthanasia process is well explained before witnessing it getting conducted. The person conducting the process may request assistance in holding the pet during the placement of a catheter in the vein or plain needle injection.All is now set to have the pet cat euthanized. Calling a vet officer to come and do the process at home is slightly expensive than taking the pet to the clinic for the process. However, it is considered the best way to accord the pet a decent send-off. One is allowed enough time to grieve the process.

Here are the common arguments against leasing- “I drive too many miles”“ I want to own my car”“I don’t want to pay for 3 years and have nothing to show for it”“I don’t want to put a large down payment” And the most common reason for people not leasing- 5. is the same reason for anyone not doing anything that they don’t know about.. people do what they are told and what they know.. you are not taught about leasing and it’s benefits. I will now break them down: Most people do not drive over 15,000 miles per year, many don’t clear 18,000 and then for the heavy driver’s, you can purchase more miles ahead of time on top of the highest allotment of 18,000/ year at just .15 -.20 cents/ mile on average depending on the brand. Yes- you have a higher payment in order to facilitate the acuisition of those miles, but you already would have been spending more by having purchased rather than leased. Now here is where it get’s interesting…. Say you drive 30,000 mile’s per year - which makes puts you at 90,000 miles after the same 3 years lease or purchase period. let’s say that you purchased the vehicle for 30,000 for a standard loan of 72 months ( 6 years). That means that you have just crossed the half way mark of your loan which is when you typically would start to gain equity on any auto purchase loan.. but I tell you this right here and now.. you have I don’t want to pay for 3 years and have nothing to show for it NO equity on a 90,000 miles 3 year old car that you now have to either keep.. with your 500 per month payment and repairs that are starting to occur. you are going to get probably 5–8,000 dollars for your midsize car or suv at best and you still owe somewhere between 12–15,000 for your loan. This is the negative equity situation or being “Upside down” that people often find themselves in.. not getting enough for your trade to payoff your loan.process that for a second… Now let’s go with the lease option for the same situation… you choose an 18,000 mile/ year lease for and purchase your extra 12,000 miles for .15 cents per mile ( as long as you do it ahead of time) and you pay an extra 150 dollars per month for the extra 12,000 miles. so where your estimated lease payment is 385 +150 you are paying around 535/ month… but here’s there thing.. you are even by the time you turn your lease in.. no negative equity. “The amount of depreciation that your car will take after a 3 year ownership with 90,000 miles is greater in impact than the monthly obligation one would pay to purchase miles in advance on the lease and be able to “trade” even up after three a 3 year lease”.You don’t own your car now. Unless your car is completely paid off.. you do not own it. Yes, you may have equity built up in it.. but this is a rare occurance.. Car dealers are notoriously low when it comes to trade appraisals. The reason for this is simple.. we are obligated to purchase the trade in vehicles. We do not buy them for our own consumption and often times whether you think so or not.. they are not fit for resale and are usually sent to the auction block.. for this reason, we are obligated to protect ourselves and our assets from too high of an investment. We simply want to get our money back out of the junk that was traded in to us. If it is nice.. yes, we will recondition it and resell it.. that is of course after all of the negotiating, throw in this, throw in that. In the event of building equity in your vehicle.. you are in the minority- which is a good thing.. I never said I disagreed with purchasing a car necessarily.. but it depends on the person and based on what you are reading from me now.. you will be able to determine what kind of candidate you are. While it is true that you will not build equity within your leased vehicle.. there is another way to look at it and consider. Lets do a more realistic comparision for this one. So you and your friend are living the same life, making the same money, driving the same miles and buying/ leasing the same car. 30,000 purchase- 500 per month ( Appx). 30,000 lease- 400/ month payment ( appx) you each drive 36,000 miles. You each took great care of the car and now that your 36 months is up you’re each ready for your next vehicle. John purchased his vehicle, owes about 12,000 left on his vehicle which can retail for 18,500 ( after reconditioning and new tires and whatnot). He gets an offer of 14,500 for his vehicle and has about 2,500 worth of equity ( after spending 100 more per month and not getting into any accidents, door dings, scratches, dents.. clean report. He puts the 2,500 down toward his next vehicle which lowers his payment about 40 dollars per month. and goes into his next purcahase 4 dollars less than he did before and pays 460. Brandon is done with his lease, which is well taken care of, but certainly not perfect, will probably need new tires for the next person but they are ok, small scratch but not too bad at all, but he has hit 2 deer, a turkey, got side swiped and he turns in his keys. He has no equity built up.. but he also has no negative equity AND didn’t have to worry about negative equity for his entire lease- not wondering if he will get enough for his “trade”. instead what he has is a 100 / month savings for the last 36 months ( 3 years) which totals….. hang with me…. 3,600. Don’t forget the accidents… Not only is Brandon not liable for the terrible history report that is now attatched to this suv he leased, but had he totaled the car at any point in time.. he would have been fully covered by Built In GAP Insurance which will make sure that you do not have any obligation left to pay in the event of a total loss. Here’s the next best part.. Not only did Brandon save 100 bux per month, get into accidents which only affected his insurance rates ( as it normally would anyway).. but now he has a Lease Loyalty offer from his leasing company which often times can equate to a 15–70 dollar payment decrease, since money down or rebates on a lease heavily impact the payment.. so the second time around is usuaully cheaper than the last, which is nice.While it is true that you will have “nothing” to show for the payments that you’ve made.. it’s the intangibles that you have to consider… for 3 years- you had GAP Insurance protection in case your vehicle was totaled your loan was protected. You paid approximately 100 less per month for 3 years than had you purchased it. You gained an extra 500–3,000 lease loyalty offer toward the next lease ( or purchase) which could be seen as a sort of equity. You did not have to worry about any accidents making a huge dent in your car history report and value. You had a warranty for the whole/ most of the time that you drove it so many or all of the repairs you may have encountered would have been covered. You get to get out of it by simply turning in the keys and selecting your next NEW vehicle and your credit score will continue to climb and solidify.You do not need a large down payment to lease a vehicle.. you do not technically need ANY down payment. What you do have to put “down” is your first month payment.. or your “drive off amount”.. if your payment is 400.. you have to make 1 of your 36 payments on day 1 of 400. That way you make your last payment and drive for a month.. not drive for your last month and then throw a payment away to finish it. but it is simply the same amount you are paying each month, and nothing more. The only time that you have to put money down above and beyond your first month payment is if you are really strictly needing to meet a monthly payment goal lower than the one being offered. OR if you are seeing a leasing commerical and you want the advertised payment.. just a heads up.. NO CAR ON TV LEASE’S FOR WHAT THE ADVETISEMENT SAYS -OTHERWISE EVERYONE WOULD DRIVE A NEW LEXUS SPORT CAR FOR 299/ MONTH. If you were able to read the fine print of the commercial ( which is showing you the top notch model that that car comes in) it would say things like.. taxes not included, lowest 10k per year, must have 4,500 extra due at signing, and its on the lowest, cheapest, rarest car that they can come up with for that model. next thing you know, you are 7,000 due at signing.. the ad is not real.. it is simply to get you to the dealership to drive traffic and get you here so that I have a chance to sell you a car. Another reason NOT to put money down on a lease is because you are always protected by GAP Insurance on the vehicle.. you have nothing to worry about.. The car company is going to protect their asset and you should keep your money in your pocket. If you total the car.. the insurance will pay for what is left owed on the loan.. it will not reemburse you for any type of down payment. You are better off just keeping the 5,000 in the bank and “borrowing” from yourself each month. Keep the 400/ month payment and take 130 out of your 5,000 to make up the difference that your down payment would have made. Otherwise if you total the car 1 month after leasing it.. your 5,000 is gone and you will have to get another car and have no down payment.. KEEP YOUR MONEY IN YOUR POCKET ON A LEASE.1–2–3–4 all lead up to number 5.. if I did my job well, you should feel better about the decesion to lease if you had been considering it. You don’t ever want to take the risk if you don’t know the reward. I am genuinely trying to help anyone that might fall into the situation of the unknown at the dealership.. most guys will not take the time to go over all of the details. I do and I wish you all the best.Is leasing better than buying? not necessarily, but it certainly goes both ways… I will not argue that for everyone, leasing is cheaper.. if you did a long term spending chart.. buying is cheaper if the planets are aligned and you can get into an equitable position.. but with the way the times are now where people are trading every 2–3 years, being careless and wreckless on the road, salt sand rust, accidents, animals, inconsiderate people.. there are sooooo many risks involved with buying a car today that werent necessarily as big of a concern in times passed.. but these cars are minimally 20,000 dollars.. trucks? 40–75,000 you tell me that you wanna put 30,000 into a “savings account” that has a hole in the bottom that you can not plug?.. forget about it.. leasing can be a hugely beneficial way for many young buyers to move forward. For me?- I simply budget x amount of dollars per month toward my transportation which is my hub for my life.. it has my communication, music, transportation, an expression of myself, it is my life line in this fast paced world we live in and I know that I want something reliable at a price I can afford, roadside assistance, not wondering if the garage is taking advantage of me and something new every few years. Equity is not “built” during a lease.. it is saved.. in a real savings account that has a security on it.. not a risky automobile that interacts with the general public and elements daily as well as being mass produced every day creating a shortage shortage of supply and demand and therefore driving values down faster over time. I put a lot of effort into this as I would like more people to become aware of the benefits of leasing and to be scared off by simple generalities saying that long term studies will show that you spend more money if you lease than buy so you shouldn’t do it… it is not that simple and many times ( myself included) peace of mind is well worth the small difference ( if any)."},{"prompt":"What is the Agni Prime missile?","completion":"Eginning in 2016, various media organisations have reported that DRDO is developing a successor to Agni-I called Agni-1P with two stages by borrowing the newer technologies from Agni-IV and Agni-V platform to increase accuracy and reliability.

The reason for that is not because of the state of technology or because one of the companies is better than the other- It is because the whole way of thinking between google and Tesla is radically different. Tesla has built a car, and slowly implemented features making it autonomous. Start with park assist, adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping and build from there. Incremental steps towards an autonomous car. Google went the other way and started with artificial intelligence- Then built a car around it. The difference is that while Tesla now has a system that works good in the mayority of situations, the Google car is going to be able to take over all the activities of the human driver- because it is developed to think like a human driver, not only to take over some of the drivers activities. It is a great example of radical vs incremental innovation- And I believe for the sake of the end result, radical innovation is the way to go here."},{"prompt":"When is the best time to format?

Here are a few reasons why seeking advice from a financial advisor can be beneficial: 1. Expertise and Knowledge: Financial advisors are professionals who have expertise in various aspects of personal finance, including investments, retirement planning, tax strategies, estate planning, and risk management. They can provide you with insights, strategies, and recommendations based on their knowledge and experience. 2. Personalized Guidance: A financial advisor can assess your unique financial circumstances, goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. They can provide personalized recommendations and help you develop a financial plan tailored to your needs. They consider your specific situation and provide guidance that aligns with your goals and values. 3. Objectivity and Unbiased Advice: A financial advisor can offer an objective perspective on your financial matters. They can provide unbiased advice and help you make informed decisions, free from emotional biases or conflicts of interest. 4. Comprehensive Financial Planning: Financial advisors can assist you in creating a comprehensive financial plan that covers multiple aspects of your financial life, including budgeting, saving, investing, retirement planning, tax optimization, and risk management. They can help you see the big picture and develop a roadmap to achieve your financial goals. 5. Market Insights and Investment Guidance: Financial advisors stay informed about market trends, economic conditions, and investment opportunities. They can help you navigate the complexities of investing, select suitable investment options, and develop an investment strategy that aligns with your goals and risk tolerance. 6. Financial Education: A financial advisor can also provide education and guidance on financial topics. They can help you understand complex financial concepts, answer your questions, and empower you to make informed financial decisions in the future. It's important to note that the value of a financial advisor largely depends on their qualifications, expertise, and ability to understand and address your specific financial needs. When choosing a financial advisor, consider factors such as their credentials, experience, reputation, and whether they operate as fiduciaries, meaning they are legally obligated to act in your best interest. While financial advisors provide valuable services, it's also important to assess the cost involved. Understand their fee structure, whether they charge a percentage of assets under management, an hourly fee, or a flat fee. Consider the potential benefits and weigh them against the cost to determine if booking a consultation with a financial advisor is worth it for you. Ultimately, the decision to work with a financial advisor depends on your individual circumstances, financial goals, complexity of your financial situation, and your comfort level with managing your finances independently. CONCLUSION If you lack expertise in financial management, I recommend enlisting the services of a skilled broker or advisor, such as Stephanie Kopp Meeks, to handle your portfolio in the market. While she oversees the trading and management of your brokerage account, you can also monitor it directly through your account access. Please perform a Google search for STEPHANIE KOPP MEEKS to learn more. Thanks and hope this helps."},{"prompt":"What do British conservatives think about such things as gun rights, ending abortion, ending gay marriage, and restoring the death penalty?","completion":"“Conservative\\" in British terms is primarily an economic position; there are social aspects as well, but immigration is probably the only major social issue that aligns with American Conservative thinking, and even then a lot of British thinking about immigration is seen through an economic lens (not all). On the American hot buttons: Gun control. While British conservatism advocates smaller government it is still ‘statist\\" with strong law and order tenets. Guns don't make the public safer and more importantly are extremely unpopular with the voting public. Nobody, left or right, wants widespread gun ownership. Abortion. Changes to abortion laws are driven by science, not religion, which, once again, is a non-issue in British politics (expressing strong religious conviction is a vote loser everywhere in the UK except NI). Women's bodily autonomy is the primary factor, but, the debate about “late term\\" abortion is a live issue for the simple reason that science keeps pushing forward as the potential for a successful live birth gets earlier and earlier. Opposing Gay marriage is once again, a religious position, so a minority view in the UK. As above NI was the exception and Westminster eventually took advantage of NI’s inability to sustain a power-sharing agreement to impose gay marriage over the religious loonies’ heads. There is a vocal minority within the British population who advocate for a return of the death penalty, and while it's more Tory than Labour, it's closer than you'd think, but it is still a minority view overall. In most respects British conservatism doesn't map to the current GOP’s obsessions at all, except in some economic areas."},{"prompt":"Who are the best Canadian immigration consultants in Chennai?","completion":"A direct suggestion after my personal experience would be the consultant at Egmore (GreenTree Immigration) since 2016 I have been in touch with them I've processed my Canada study visa, PGWP & PR application Got all these 3 application processed and approved by them.

What was said about geometry many centuries ago is equally applicable to stock trading. There is no shortcut to success in stock trading. So, what is the secret success formula that we are looking for? The secret to your trading success is not in the stock or in your online stockbroker. It is entirely with you. The legendary trader, Jesse Livermore, has laid out a complete set of rules for success in the stock markets. If we were to summarize all these trading secrets, we can put them into four key points. As a trader, always listen to the markets Every time the market has a story to tell. As a trader, it is your primary job to interpret the market cues and trade accordingly. The trader has to base his performance on facts and not on opinions. As a trader, you must avoid the temptation of trying to be contrarian in the market. If you are bullish and the market is falling, it is basically giving you a message that you have missed out on key factors. Listen to the message and modify your stance accordingly. Be thorough in your research We often believe that traders do not have to research stocks and it is only for the long-term investors. That is not true. Even a trader needs to understand the many facets of the stock like company performance, balance sheet strength, the impact of news flows, technical charts, among others. That is the only way you can interpret signals and project how the stock will react to news and earning flows. One of the basic secrets here is to start small and then build positions as you build your conviction. Remember that profits are never made in all trades but in a handful of trades. Make them count. Hold on to your profits long enough and cut your losses fast. That is only possible through in-depth research into stocks and markets. Spread your trades adequately Don’t concentrate all your capital on just a few trades. While it is necessary that you keep your universe of stocks limited since that is the only way you can trade with insights, but don’t try and focus all your capital on just one or two stocks or themes. For example, if all your trades are focused on banks, NBFCs, autos, and realty, then your trades are really sensitive to interest rates. If the RBI announces a hike in the repo rates then all your trading positions will be impacted and losses could be larger than you anticipated. The idea of diversification in trading is to ensure that your trading book is not dependent on just one or two events. Finally, it all boils down to discipline You cannot make a success of your stock trading activity unless you instill discipline at every level. Firstly, you need discipline on capital protection. Work out the various levels of losses that you are willing to take on an intraday, weekly and overall basis. The moment these levels are hit, have the discipline to shut down your terminal and revisit your strategy. Secondly, stop loss and profit targets are an absolute necessity. You can never be a successful trader unless these two disciplines are instilled. Thirdly, have the discipline of separating capital money and profit money. The levels of risk you can afford to take on both these differ. Ironically, the best traders are those who get these basic rules right. Trading is not about adding on risks but a lot more about managing risks. Take care of the risks and the returns will take care of themselves! Sometimes simple rules are the reason for a big change. Sometimes people with so much knowledge got the wrong entry and cause a heavy loss and sometimes a beginner with zero knowledge have some beautiful profit in his hand. But that's not the story of all time it's just about luck and luck doesn't work always. So make yourself very professional and go with strategies instead of applying luck every time. But strategies are not the things that anyone can create any professional research advisors can create strategies. If you want to make money in the stock market then take advice from good advisors and just wait and watch. Eqwires Research Analyst is one of the best research analyst companies in India. They have the best team of professionals research analysts who works with proper strategies and provide guidance to everyone."},{"prompt":"Why does Transcendental Meditation smell like a scam? Is this trademarked, paid program for real, or are they piggybacking on the general meditation trend?","completion":"Transcendental Meditation™ actually started the big meditation trend in the late 1960s. Strange that you should feel that TM™ is a follower, rather than the leader. Prior to TM there had been several popular meditation and yoga teachers who popularized their programs successfully, but TM was by far the largest such program. In the early 1970s about 15,000 people a month were learning TM in the USA alone. Including the entire world, something like several million people have learned TM. TM was trademarked very early in its development, and it also began requiring course fees early because people tend to devalue what they receive for free and also because Maharishi Mahesh Yogi decided that the best way to teach many people was to train teachers and to own their own meditation centers. Maharishi’s foresight resulted in this tremendously successful public movement to learn and teach TM. Unfortunately, by surrounding himself with devoted followers, he began to isolate TM through such unsuccessful policies as a high course fee (the fee reached a peak of 2,500 for everyone, with no exceptions). As a result, today few people even remember the massive phenomenon that was TM. Today, TM is still available around the world, with much more reasonable course fees (960 for most adults, USA) and with several free special teaching programs. TM is still taught by highly trained and certified teachers, and still offers various advanced programs and ongoing support."},{"prompt":"Why were the ancient Macedonians never allowed to compete at the Olympics before Alexander I came up with the 'one Greek ancestor story' and then only the Macedonian royal family was only allowed to compete, until Philip II conquered the Greeks?","completion":"Exclusionary societies were not entirely uncommon in that age.

Can anyone offer any SEO tips to help improve my SERP ranking on Google?","completion":"I dont know what kind of adult site is yours but here is the guide for for adult e-commerce site and the same should apply same for any adult site. Marketing and driving traffic to an sex toy e-commerce store is not an easy task. If you don't have a brand for yourself then establishing an authority in the industry can be tricky and time consuming. Most people look for trusted adult toy stores while making the purchase because this isn't something which is a normal buy and people who buy it wants to make sure that everything is safe and secured. If you are a brand new sex toy store or having tuff time driving traffic to your adult toy store then follow the below suggestions. I'm sure it will help. SEO SEO should be your number one priority when driving traffic to your website. Target low competition and long tail keywords starting out. If you target high competition and short tail keywords then you wont reach anywhere because there are already well established sites ranking for it and competing with them is near to impossible. Next step in SEO is create a blog page and write articles about sex toys, sex advice or anything that matches your website and products. Getting traffic to your blog is the easiest way to make more sales of your products. Next is create backlinks for your product pages. There are lot of methods of doing this but one of the best and effective method is though guest posting or outreaching to other websites or blogs. In your case you should be looking for adult sites for example adult blogs that writes adult related articles, sex blogs, the blogs that write about sex toys etc. Dont waste time outreaching and sending mails for non adult related blogs as they will barely accept anything related to sex and adult. So your main target sites should be adult content sites. Doing this will help greatly to increase your rankings in the google for your target keywords. Better Rankings = Better Traffic = Better Sales! I would say spend most of your time in SEO and optimising your e-commerce website. Influencers Well, this works great as well. As your are in adult niche, try reaching out for TikTok models and make them to do the thing for your and promote your adult toy. Especally reach out for models like bikini models or may be even OnlyFans models! If you ask me getting in touch with OnlyFans models can do some real magic if the model has loyal following! Obviously, this will cost a bit of money but if the tiktoker has huge fan following then the expose you can get for your adult store can be massive! These 2 i.e SEO and influencers would be my go-to method especially when promoting your e-commerce sex toy store. The other promotional ways to drive traffic can include: Social Media (especially twitter)Comminity engagementAd banners on other sitesPromoting your products with the help of twitter modelsAffiliate partnership with other brands or individual bloggersPR campaignsYouTubers (Would work great. there are lot of YouTubers who talk about sex and stuff. There are even a lot of adult models and OnlyFans models who have youtube channels with good subscribers. So make sure you reach out to them as well.) But if you ask me, branding your site, ranking for your keywords in top 10 results of Google and getting quality links to your site is the best long term strategy for your adult sex toy e-commerce business!! Hope you got some idea and my answer was helpful!"},{"prompt":"it ironic that Trump's new social media platform, touted as a haven for free speech, has the 23rd guideline stipulating that you're not allowed to speak negatively about the site itself?","completion":"His new platform is nothing more than an echo chamber where his followers can heap universal praise on Trump and themselves.

It contains several compounds with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that can help soothe and hydrate the skin.

Assuming you don't experience any negative reactions, you can apply aloe vera gel on your face overnight. However, make sure to clean your face thoroughly before applying the gel to avoid trapping dirt or bacteria against your skin. Also, use a small amount of the gel and spread it evenly on your face. If you have oily or acne-prone skin, you may want to avoid applying the gel to areas that are prone to breakouts.

Why & how compared in importance?","completion":"Both the Battle of Kursk and the Battle of Stalingrad were crucially important and decisive battles in World War II, but in different ways. The Battle of Stalingrad, fought from August 1942 to February 1943, was a turning point in the war on the Eastern Front. It was the first major defeat suffered by the German Army, which had previously been undefeated in battle. The battle saw intense urban combat as the Germans attempted to capture the city of Stalingrad (now Volgograd) and the Soviets fought to defend it. The battle ended in a decisive Soviet victory, with the Germans suffering enormous casualties and losing the initiative on the Eastern Front. The battle is often seen as a turning point in the war and a major factor in the eventual defeat of Germany. The Battle of Kursk, fought in July-August 1943, was the largest tank battle in history and is often seen as the turning point of the war on the Eastern Front. The Germans launched a massive offensive against the Soviet salient at Kursk, hoping to encircle and destroy the Soviet forces there. However, the Soviets had built extensive defensive fortifications and prepared an elaborate counter-attack. The battle ended in a decisive Soviet victory, with the Germans suffering massive losses in tanks and men. The battle marked the end of the German offensive capability on the Eastern Front and paved the way for the Soviet advance towards Berlin. In terms of importance, both battles were crucial in their own ways. The Battle of Stalingrad was the first major defeat suffered by the German Army, which had previously been undefeated in battle. It was a turning point in the war on the Eastern Front and marked the beginning of the Soviet offensive that would eventually lead to the capture of Berlin. The Battle of Kursk, on the other hand, was the largest tank battle in history and marked the end of the German offensive capability on the Eastern Front. It also paved the way for the Soviet advance towards Berlin. Both battles were significant in different ways and contributed to the eventual Allied victory in World War II."},{"prompt":"Does Orthodox Judaism hold that Lucifer is not evil and is in fact YHWH’s servant?","completion":"Lucifer, also known as Satan or the Devil, doesn’t exist in Judaism.

What are their responsibilities? What do they do to grow their company every day?","completion":"CEOs of start-ups (and all other companies) only need to do three things: 1. Set and communicate a unified vision and culture. 2. Ensure the business has capital and is on good financial footing. 3. Recruit talent and make sure the right people are in the right seats. Of course, CEOs often do so much more than this and that's great ... as long as it does not come at a cost of the three core things a CEO does. Set and communication a unified vision and culture. See: [LINKED_TEXT: answer to When my start-up leadership team grows rapidly, what can I do to ensure everyone still gets along well with each other?] [URL: http://www.quora.com/When-my-start-up-leadership-team-grows-rapidly-what-can-I-do-to-ensure-everyone-still-gets-along-well-with-each-other/answer/Auren-Hoffman?srid=tdJ&share=1] when everyone is rowing in the same direction, the magic happens. Having a unified vision and unified culture allows everyone to be rowing in the same direction. This is also a cautionary tale for companies that want to grow headcount too quickly. Smart start-ups do everything possible to keep headcount down so that it remains easier to keep a unified vision and culture. While others in the company can help set the vision and the culture, it is ultimately the CEO’s responsibility. The vision needs to be clear, understandable, and differentiated. The culture often mirrors the personality of the company's CEO. This is why it is often so hard to do a CEO transition at a company ... it usually necessitates a cultural transition (especially when an outside CEO is brought it). Ensure the business has capital and is on good financial footing. It is really hard to think and plan long-term if one is worried about starving every day. The CEO needs to ensure the company is either generating sufficient capital or has raised sufficient capital to allow her team to think long-term. Otherwise, the company will be making terrible trade-offs and sacrificing long-term advantage for short-term gains. Recruit talent and make sure the right people are in the right seats.

It is a knock-down, hand-to-hand, fight-club brawl. And anyone who says recruiting is not a challenge is not going after the top talent. As important as recruiting the right people is thinking strategically on how to use the assets you have.

Furthermore, in writing the molar specific enthalpies (lowercase convention) above I have neglected the change in moles of gas, assuming the amount of water to be evaporated to be small. Fully rigorously, I would take a basis volume of gas, consider extensive enthalpies and consider volume expansion effects, say in a piston model where I would use internal energy. Even with these assumptions, the equation is still implicit in temperature due to the nonlinearity trend of saturation pressure and gas enthalpy with respect to temperature and difficult to solve. Due to these calculation difficulties, it is often common to consult charts which have solved the equation with full rigor for a representative set of conditions. See, for example, Examining both this solution and various such charts qualitatively is still valuable. For example, will the wet bulb temperature be greater or lesser than the dry bulb temperature? Will the difference between wet bulb temperature and dry bulb temperature be greater or lesser for increasing dry bulb temperature? Note that in my derivation I assumed the initial water content to be zero. Will the difference in between wet bulb pressure and dry bulb temperature be greater or lesser for increasing initial humidity?"},{"prompt":"What is the cheapest country to visit from India?","completion":"Nepal"},{"prompt":"w do you wake yourself up in the morning?","completion":"AMA - Feb 13, 2021. Purpose, not passion. I’m passionate about a lot of things. Those of you who know me well know my obsession with food, birds and books. However, these are not what wake me up every morning. Purpose is what gets you started; passion is what keeps you going. There are three things that I really care about, things that I have chosen to be my long term purpose. To rid the world of mediocrity and propel the human race towards the pursuit of excellence.To make a positive impact in at least one person’s life every day and be the reason for their smile.To have a meaningful conversation with any person in any room anywhere in the world. Every night before I go to bed, I recap my day and just spend a few minutes thinking about the things I did and didn’t do that would accrue to my purpose. I then think about the one single thing in each of these three buckets I will do the following day and noodle on those thoughts as I sleep. When I wake up the next morning, I have a purpose; I’m excited to get out of bed and get started on making those thoughts and dreams a reality. For example, last night when I went to bed, these were my thoughts: I ran an AMA on Quora and LinkedIn today and was able to respond to about 25 DMs as well as publish one answer on the platform. Tomorrow when I wake up I will respond to at least 3 questions on the platform and publish them over the week.I worked with a mentee to draw up an accountability plan for a project he is working on. He was low on confidence for quite some time now and was having a hard time getting started. I felt good having worked with him through it and taking those baby steps together to a point where he is now willing and able to be more independent. Tomorrow when I wake up, I will talk to a friend I haven’t spoken to in a while who I know has been navigating rough waters and I hope I can help brighten his day a little bit.I just finished reading a book and a dozen blogs about water scarcity. It is an area I’ve grown recently interested in and have spent time learning about. It is a very real problem that is going to be front and center a decade from today and I would like to be well informed and in a position to work on solutions well before that. I’m currently at the initial stages of really learning about the problem space and it is exciting to wake up every morning and go learn something completely new. Learning a wide breadth of topics helps you have conversations with people; we always bond over something we have in common, and often a shared knowledge or perspective on an issue can be just that ice breaker. \\"The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why.\\" -Mark Twain.

Let’s say your connection is A, the website you’d like to visit is B and the proxy server is P. An ordinary connection would be A -> B. With an added proxy server, your connection becomes A -> P -> B. But what’s so special about that? Well, firstly you get a new IP and if the proxy is encrypted — you do get an additional security level on top. Proxy servers act as a firewall and web filter, provide shared network connections, and cache data to speed up common requests. A good proxy server keeps users and the internal network protected from the threats that live on the wild Internet. Lastly, proxy servers can provide a high level of privacy. Here are some uses for a proxy server: A school or local library blocks access to certain websites and a student wants to get around that.You want to look at something online that interests you…but you would prefer it couldn’t be traced back to your IP address and your location.You’re traveling abroad and the technology set up in the country you’re in prevents you from connecting to a website back home.You want to post comments on websites but you do not want your IP address to be identified or your identity tracked down.Your employer blocks access to social media or other sites and you’d like to bypass those restrictions.

Indian Railway is popularly known as the largest rail network in Asia and the world’s second-largest rail network. Words are not enough to describe the importance of Indian Railways in the country because the Indian Railway is known as the backbone of our country. Railways are known as the best mode of transportation if you are travelling on a long route because it provides ultimate comfort to the passenger.

Can anyone do something similar these days?","completion":"I’m going to take the liberty of adding a few words to your question. “Abe Lincoln was a self-taught lawyer back in the days when the amount of legal knowledge a practicing attorney needed to have was so minimal compared to today that comparing the knowledge base and skill set of an 1836 lawyer to the knowledge base and skill set of a modern-day lawyer is like comparing the knowledge base and skill set of a boy scout with a first aid merit badge to the knowledge base and skill set of a licensed physician. Can anyone do something similar these days?” No. The legal profession is so different today from what it looked like in the year 1836, it hardly counts as being the same occupation. Although Lincoln was considered to be a skilled litigator by the standards of the mid-nineteenth century, his lawyering skills wouldn’t cut it in the year 2023. The truth is, I was a better legal writer than Abraham Lincoln by the time I had completed two months of law school. So was every other student in my first-semester legal writing class. You will undoubtedly receive some answers from people who claim that it’s possible to become a self-taught lawyer in some US states in the year 2023. And every one of those answers will be wrong. Here’s the truth: In 46 US states, DC, and the five inhabited territories, you need to earn a law degree before you can qualify to take a bar examination.In three US states (VA, VT, WA), there is an alternate path to qualifying for admission to the bar for college graduates. After earning your bachelor’s degree, you can complete a formal four-year apprenticeship under the supervision of a licensed attorney. The word ‘apprenticeship’ is a misnomer. The ‘apprenticeship’ entails the same academic curriculum that you would have to complete if you were enrolled in a traditional law school, except that the mentor attorney is your only professor. The curriculum is set by the state bar. About a dozen apprentices become lawyers each year by following this alternate path.In one US state (CA), you can qualify for admission to the bar with only two years of college. After completing two years of college, you can complete a formal four-year apprenticeship under the supervision of a licensed attorney. The apprentice studies a curriculum that has been pre-approved by the state bar, with final exams and regular progress reports to the board of bar examiners. About 2–3 apprentices become lawyers each year by following this path. It’s also worth mentioning that a lawyer without an honest-to-goodness law degree is virtually unemployable."},{"prompt":"What are your bad experiences at ALLEN Kota?","completion":"Its good but the bench really a dreadful thing Bag quality change karo plz.... 5spiral bhi nahi utha pata Plus i want them to look into the matter of uniform fellow...

Diet and drugs are the strongest altering factors in the gut microbiome. That said, dysbiosis in the mouth linked not just oral but several systemic issues as well. Several studies suggest that most probably does. The details are being investigated. My thoughts are that for sure, the mouth’s clearance is happening by swallowing, so all microbes tend to move toward the more distal parts of the gut. The next step though, the acidic stomach is highly protective and helps keeping the small intestines more or less microbe free. The colon, as mostly referred to the gut microbiota, is highly influenced by diet, because undigested particles, mostly fibers can reach that part and selectively feed/ starve species, supporting diversity. More important I think when there is a dysbiosis in the oral microbiome. Typically when disease present, in this case gum disease (periodontal disease). That’s caused by specific pathogens that are linked to several other conditions, some studies showed link to colon cancer, but probably not by altering the gut microbiome.

In saying this, does not automatically assume that any conspiracy took place, as it was so eloquently said. It’s damning that everyone will always wholeheartedly believe, blindly, whatever the government says. It’s aggravating to say the least. This is not to say the the conspiracy theorists are correct, either. WTC 7 collapsed without being hit whatsoever. In addition, no other steel skyscraper has ever collapsed before or since 9/11. Government reports completely ignore most eyewitness reports, as well as other factors. Other countries warned our government of the strong possibility of a terrorist attack. They may not have been specific, but most attacks have targeted WTC in the past, so it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure that one out. Black boxes of the aircraft, some of which were recovered, were never released to the public. All surveillance of the incident have been kept from the public, courtesy of our government.

Start at an easy pace when doing HIIT for the first time (e.g. 1:2) and build upto better rates (e.g. 2:1). Typical HIIT sessions should last 20 minutes. 3. Nutrtion: As with any exercise method, the amount of energy you have is dependent on your nutrition. Daily nutrition aside, you can increase your energy by having a pre-workout meal. Having a banana with some almonds/walnuts before your workout would go a long way. 4. Exercise type: This is pretty subjective. Some people do better with running, others with cycling, some others with jump rope, and so on. See if another exercise works better for you. I personally jump rope for HIIT.

And this fetus-human need the mother’s blood, bodily fluid, nutrition… to survive. And you know what, the mother can still say no, even that means the death of this fetus-human. That’s how bodily autonomy works. We do not legally compel people to donate their organs or blood even their organs or blood can save lives. We do not legally compel parents to give their kidneys to their children to save the child’s life. If a person is brain dead, we do not take the dead person’s organ to save someone without the dead person or their power attorneys content. Let that sink in, we don’t take organs or tissues from a dead person without prior consent. The question is not whether the fetus is a human, the question is whether the mother can say no to using her body, her organ, her blood, to support the fetus. And the answer is the pregnant woman has the right to say NO, because of bodily autonomy. If you want to force women to carry the fetus to term, you need to abolish bodily autonomy. Here’s how it works: Start with national registration of blood type.If someone needs an organ or blood or tissue, the government will search the citizen database.If a match is found, the healthy person MUST donate their organ, their blood, or their tissue to save the sick person even if the procedure is dangerous and potentially life-threatening. No? you don’t want to donate your kidney to save someone’s life? But women must carry the fetus to term regardless? … So it’s not really about human life, is it? It’s about you wanting to deny women’s rights to their own bodies. Comment closed.

They are affordable, eco-friendly, and easy to use. One question that many people have about electric scooters is whether or not the battery charges itself. In this article, we will explore the topic in depth and provide you with everything you need to know about scooter batteries. [LINKED_TEXT: Mcleodproducts's post in Marlon Mcleod - Starting Your Online Business] [URL: https://mcleodproducts.quora.com/What-are-the-most-effective-strategies-to-grow-my-business-Growing-a-business-requires-a-well-thought-out-and-comprehe] Firstly, it is important to understand that electric scooters are powered by a rechargeable battery. This battery stores electrical energy that is used to power the motor and allow the scooter to move. When the battery is depleted, it needs to be recharged before the scooter can be used again. So, does the battery charge itself? The answer is no. The battery in an electric scooter does not have the ability to recharge itself. It requires an external source of power to recharge. This is typically done by plugging the scooter into an electrical outlet using a charger that is provided with the scooter. The battery in an electric scooter is typically a lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery. These batteries are known for their high energy density, long cycle life, and low self-discharge rate. This means that they can hold a charge for a long time and can be recharged many times before they need to be replaced. When the battery in an electric scooter is charging, the charger sends an electrical current through the battery. This current causes a chemical reaction inside the battery that stores energy in the form of chemical bonds. When the battery is fully charged, the chemical reaction stops and the battery is ready to be used. It is important to note that the charging time for an electric scooter battery can vary depending on the size of the battery and the charger being used. Typically, it takes anywhere from 4-8 hours to fully charge an electric scooter battery. Some scooters have fast chargers that can charge the battery in as little as 2 hours. In addition to charging time, it is also important to consider the range of the scooter. The range refers to the distance that the scooter can travel on a single charge. The range of an electric scooter is determined by the size of the battery and the efficiency of the motor. A larger battery will typically provide a longer range, while a more efficient motor will require less energy and provide a longer range. To maximize the range of your electric scooter, it is important to follow some simple guidelines. First, make sure that the battery is fully charged before using the scooter. Second, avoid riding the scooter at full speed for extended periods of time, as this will drain the battery faster. Third, try to avoid steep hills and rough terrain, as this will also drain the battery faster.

It requires an external source of power to recharge. When the battery is charging, a chemical reaction stores energy in the form of chemical bonds.

First, you need to ensure that the system you choose is compatible with your pets, taking into account their size, breed, and any specific requirements they may have. Second, consider the energy efficiency of the system you're interested in. You want your pets to be comfortable, but you also want to keep your energy bills under control. So, look for HVAC systems that are energy-efficient and have a good SEER rating. Third, the air quality in your home is also essential to consider. Pets can produce dander, hair, and other allergens that can affect the air quality of your home. Therefore, look for HVAC systems that have high-quality air filters and consider investing in additional air purifiers or cleaners. Lastly, don't forget about the maintenance needs of the HVAC system. Choose a system that's easy to maintain and has a good warranty. Regular maintenance is essential to ensure your system runs efficiently and prevent any problems that could affect your pets' comfort."},{"prompt":"What are your choices of preference in NEET 2022 counseling?","completion":"With an AIR of 3025 and being from the UR category most of the “great colleges\\" aren't something I can aim for.

I think the US are to blame for a lot of it, because scientists are paid by private companies so you don't know if what they're saying is money orientated or the truth.

Anyone who knows anything about programming would never agree to such a scheme. For example, this: // this is Java! System.out.println( \\"This is the greatest program ever!\\" ); Produces the exact same output as: System.out.print( \\"This \\" ); System.out.print( \\"is \\" ); System.out.print( \\"the \\" ); System.out.print( \\"greatest \\" ); System.out.print( \\"program \\" ); System.out.println( \\"ever!\\" ); Do you see a problem here? Taking it even further, suppose your programmer got greedy one day and decided he needed a new Tesla. Your source code just became: System.out.print( \\"T\\" ); System.out.print( \\"h\\" ); System.out.print( \\"i\\" ); System.out.print( \\"s\\" ); System.out.print( \\" \\" ); System.out.print( \\"i\\" ); System.out.print( \\"s\\" ); // you get the idea No, I hope this has never been attempted. If so, hopefully the originator probably learned that this was the wrong way to pay for software development. The closest I came across this was a friend who worked for the US government. He and all the other programmers were writing in assembly and were required to write a comment on every line of source code saying what it was doing. Every line. That got old quick, but they had “spotters” walking around making sure the programmers were commenting every line (this was in the early 1980s when automated tools for this didn’t exist). It’s surprising that source lines of code are still used as a metric for programmer efficiency. “Hey! I wrote 2000 lines of source code today! You only wrote 25! You suck! I’m awesome!” Yeah, it doesn’t work that way."},{"prompt":"Iraq better off today than it would have been still under Saddam?","completion":"not only sunni people supported him, but some of christains

from america via saddam and they ¼ million saddam wasnt sunni, he will never be one, he didnt have a religion, but he put a sunni mask to represent, and to make the arabs love him, since the rest of the arabs are sunnis and only us iraqis from the arabs who have a 75% of shia, therefore we are hated by most of them by the way those sunnis batryed him, and those sunnis let isis get in iraq and

\\"not sunni called\\" rather the friendly side) when saddam got killed which was eid, these people were extremely sad, if you loved him that much, why did you batrye him, if saddam choose us shia ones we will never batrye him, yet we wouldnt allow war with iran thats why, he took our people and forced them to fight if saddam had another chance out of his court trial, he wouldve took the biggest revenge on his people, i mean it, he made a big mistake in trusting them, after he fed them and took care of them, they werent loyal after all i actually have a sunni friend “tikreet” whos family wasnt from the ba3eeth party, and his father hated saddam, because saddam slapped his father and threaten to kill his family. my friends father used to tell my friends younger sibling to say saddam ibn elkalb, means son of dog after all whoever supported him, know that saddam was feeding them such as Palestinan and Jordanians, who saddam got to our country and gave them iraqi rights, and iraqi healthcare system, iraqi educations, that us shia and kurds never had, we managed to kick them out after saddam died, they love him to death as if he was their god, we didnt kick them out because they took our rights, its because they loved him (seriously bro why do you get in the iraqi business, mind your jordainan, Palestinian related country issues alright) (you lots be happy on your iraqi arabs bruvs expenses, just because we are shia, is that what your sunni religion teaches you, wheres the sense of humanity) they think he hit 39 missles on isreal, 39 missles all Palestine wouldve been gone, all missles dropped in sahraah of iraq and palestine we managed to take revenge of his people, but most of em escaped to jordan, turkey, gulf at the end they wanted to take revenge for saddam by letting isis in, thats when karma took place and back flipped on them and their \\"sisters\\" and mothers my family were the ones who signed the death penalty, and we questioned him, and

Do they just let this powerful person walk around untrained and dangerous, maybe fall to the dark side?","completion":"This was a pressing question for me in the one Star Wars campaign my gaming group played with. I played a Force-Sensitive smuggler-or-something, and another of us played a legit Jedi (starting as a padawan on detached assignment). So how did we interact? I started out using my Force-Sensitivity for a couple tricks (extra sensitivity in drawing a bead on someone with a blaster; cadging drinks in a bar by showing how I could down a shot without using my hands). But as the game progressed, well, it became a really serious matter of philosophy: Could I actually use my proto-Force powers without getting myself into serious trouble? (I’d tried a “Jedi mind trick” a couple times and just made things much worse—the game master was masterful at it :) ) Just how did my Jedi pal (eventually graduated from padawan) manage to handle himself without getting into trouble? For me, it was a turning point in my career with my pals. Eventually I asked my Jedi friend, “Can you help me see how to not screw things up?” “Thought you’d never ask,” he replied. And I ended up as his not-really-legal padawan—eventually pulling him out of trouble more often than he pulled me :) But, yes, what happened in canon with Force-Sensitives who didn’t have a fall-back in their own culture? My backstory: I was a Coruscanti brat from the poverty-stricken alleyways at the bottom rungs of the planet-city, escaping poverty by getting berths on one ship after another, looking more towards smuggling than anything legit—sure wasn’t going to join the AgraCorps!

PDF (Portable Document Format) and EPUB (Electronic Publication) are two widely used file formats for documents and e-books, each with its own set of advantages. Converting between them provides greater flexibility in accessing and reading content across multiple devices. There are various methods for converting PDF files to EPUB format. Online converting tools are one possibility. Many websites provide free PDF to EPUB conversion services, allowing you to upload a PDF file and obtain an EPUB file in return. These internet tools are typically useful for simple documents with simple formatting. Another way is to use dedicated software programmes built exclusively for converting PDF to EPUB. These software solutions include more extensive functionality, such as preserving complicated formatting, handling photos, and managing metadata during conversion. Furthermore, they frequently support batch conversions, which saves time when dealing with several files. Similarly, comparable procedures can be used to convert EPUB files to PDF. Converting EPUB files to PDF format is frequently available via online conversion services and software programmes. These tools ensure that the original EPUB file's layout, graphics, and formatting are faithfully retained in the final PDF version. It is crucial to note that while converting files from PDF to EPUB or vice versa, the conversion may not always be perfect. To achieve the best readability in the EPUB format, PDF files, particularly those with complex layouts, may require manual modifications after conversion. Similarly, EPUB files with complex formatting may require minor adjustments after conversion to retain the desired appearance in PDF format. Ultimately, online tools and dedicated software programmes can convert PDF files to EPUB and vice versa. These technologies enable users to access and read content on various devices. However, reviewing the converted files and making necessary adjustments is important to ensure the best possible conversion results.

A crusty old commander commented, “You may only have 2000 hours, but the other guys only have one hour. They just have 5,000 of that hour.” This is relevant to this question because autopilot systems are generally only used for the boring things. It takes very little pilot skill and a great deal of pilot attention to maintain straight and level or make 4.5° turns at 38,000 feet. You’re concentrating on the mundane so much, you’re likely to miss something important. The autopilot may take over the monkey work, but it doesn’t mean you’re not flying the plane. Technically, the wings are keeping you airborne, but we don’t poo-poo the pilot when he doesn’t flap his arms. Autopilot systems elevate the pilot from a reaction engine to a flight manager. When you’re the sole manipulator of the controls, you’re not managing the flight like you need to in a complex, exacting airspace. The margins are so narrow in the modern traffic control system that simply flying around isn’t going to cut it any longer. You need to be able to interpret a complicated set of instructions and input and process them in a timely fashion. If you’re bogged down with altitude-airspeed-heading-pitch-thrust ad nauseam, you’re going to miss something. And if you are just flying the plane, you’re not getting good at the autopilot. It’s not just a button you push before you start working on your club soda and shrimp cocktail. There’s a spectrum of control measures from full automation to two-fisting the yoke and thrust levers. If you can’t seamlessly move to the most appropriate level of automation, you’re setting yourself up for pilot-induced snakes on the flight deck. Working the autopilot is a piloting skill all by itself. They may be king in Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots and dating millionaires, but reflexes aren’t the only aspect to successful piloting."},{"prompt":"Can I get a work permit for Canada for myself and my brother at the same time?

When I was in 9th standard, I had a hugeeee crush on a senior(10th standard). He lives in my colony and all the kids from my colony(who went to the same school as me) used to travel by van. So this senior ALWAYS sat behind me in the van. There was a single window in the van and i used to wake up early just to take the window seat. My crush used to lean forward towards the window to enjoy the cold morning breeze. During that time i legit used to get butterflies. My crush always thought that i was a studious kid so he never “gossiped” with me. The only time i remember talking to him was when I asked him to lend me some notes of a teacher🤧. So one fine day i was leaving the school all submerged in my thoughts that i didn't even notice that my bag was not zipped up. Even my friends didn't point it out. At that moment my crush shouted my name and i froze. He came running towards me and zipped my bag and patted me “good to go now”. I literally stood there for 2 minutes thinking what the hell just happened😂😂. Another incident: All the kids in my colony used to go to one tuition. My crush too. But he was from different class so we had different timings. One day our teacher had to go somewhere so she merged the timings of class 9th and 10th. I was like “ Aaj toh maje aenge 😂”. So in excitement I went there a little too early. And guess what! He was there too. Nobody else had come till then and even my tuition teacher was surprised to see us 20 min early.We had to even arrange the tables to sit. My crush arranged the table for me😛. Then both of us just sat there without uttering anything. Eventually the rest of the students started coming and both of us got busy with the tuition. But in the middle of the class, I peeked at him through the corner of my eyes and he was looking at me too!!!!!! There was a second of eye contact and then both of us smiled awkwardly😆. I thought that maybe. ….Maybe he likes me too🥺. But guess what😑 he got in a relationship with someone else not long after that. And I still never gave up my window seat😇. P.

Some say it’s near the last Thu of the month, as markets are volatile due to F&O settlements. Possibly, the best way to answer this is to check data. So, we looked at the NIFTY 50 TRI returns for the last 10 years. Over the last decade, there was hardly any difference in SIP returns, irrespective of the date you picked. The highest return was 12.07% (on 24th of every month). The lowest returns turned out to be 11.99% (9th & 18th). Not only large-cap, we also looked at mid-cap & small-cap returns as well. The trend was similar. The SIP date didin’t matter in the long term. Still, Which Date To Choose? Pick a date at your convenience. For instance, if you have a regular income, you can set your SIP date within 2-3 days of receiving your salary. Hope it helps!

However, Goku can sense blood-lust in someone’s Ki. So it’s also possible that Goku could still dodge it. In addition that Goku was relaxed here (as he planned to for the next 10 days before the Cell Games), the rock Krillin tossed produced little to no sound as well when tossed, so it’s unlikely Goku would’ve dodged it. I personally would say in a Deku to Goku ratio, in which occurrence is more likely, I would probably say 4:5, just because of how loud Deku’s attacks have been. Now onto the next situation, in a fight which also can be split into main 2 parts. After fightsDuring fights Now after fights, here are 2 examples people love to use, but let’s go through them each one by one. First is Goku getting pierced by a laser in the Golden Freeza Arc… If Deku can manage something what Freeza did and keep Goku’s attention onto one thing, then sure it is highly possible for Deku to actually one-shot Goku. Next is when he got injured by a bullet. Goku’s reasoning for this? Being rusty with his skills it seems. So how likely will Goku be in this situation? I am very confident in saying ZERO. I doubt Deku would go as low as this just for a win, not to mention Goku currently would not fall for this crap again. During fights? Yeah it’s a no brainer, even while off guard he can take hits from beings on par with him or stronger. Overall, it is very unlikely Deku would get the opportunity to catch Goku off-guard and one-shot him."},{"prompt":"What is the slickest way a person has gotten out of a traffic ticket?","completion":"The slickest out I ever encountered was the couple alleging labor.

Also, if you were wanting to have a lively craic in a pub or at a party, which would be better? A group of stoners vacantly staring out the window, or a bunch of drinkers? In my very limited experience weed is not as good for socialising. It probably takes away the urge to do so and allows one to swing in hammock alone without a care in the world.

Being inventive is an act of doing. To invent something, you must have an intention to fulfill a need that is not already fulfilled by creating a new technological device. This is Tony’s wheelhouse. The Anti-Gravity Device: A deceptively simple small red box, the Anti-Gravity Device can project an energy beam that counteracts the force of gravity for any objects inside the beam, causing them to behave as if no gravity existed. This same device can have the reverse effect — extra-gravity, increasing the force of gravity on an object — and it's powerful enough to lift entire mountains, if only for a few minutes.The Jupiter Landing Vehicle: A sturdy, versatile vehicle, the JLV was designed specifically to take on the inhospitable, heavy-gravity terrain of Jupiter. It was equipped with a sonic disrupter unit that can shatter mountains, thick treads that could navigate any terrain, lasers, and lobster-claw arms.Bleeding Edge Armor: While each armor has been impressive, the changes made for this suit are substantially more impressive, as the suit is both placed into the bones of Tony Stark to be summoned conveniently at any time, and able to self-repair via constantly replicating nano-machines. Batman has designed the Batmobile, Batwing, Bat-boat, and all kinds of other vehicles, gadgets, and suits, but for the most part they aren’t quite in the same league as Tony’s inventions. Being creative however, is a state of mind. It’s how you function in the world around you. It is in your nature to come up with plans, to come up with ideas, whether it’s producing ideas for the free world, the marketplace or government, for the arts, or for yourself. Bruce Wayne would probably feel more at home here, being a genius, billionaire looking to improve his city in any way he can. On top of being a vigilante looking to cause as much fear in the hearts of criminals as possible, to the point that Amanda Waller legitimately believes that he’s a metahuman. Bruce has devised countless theoretical and posable weaknesses for a number of individuals. For example: The Martian Manhunter's most notable weakness is fire. Batman has devised a nanite virus which, if introduced into J'onn's body, would convert the outer layer of his skin into magnesium, causing him to burst into flames upon exposure to air, a fire that wouldn’t be put out even if J’onn were to submerge himself in water.Batman has devised an altered version of Scarecrow's Fear Toxin specifically designed to cause Aquaman to become Hydrophobic, causing him to remain from any body of water and become weaker every second.Green Lantern would be rendered blind by his own power ring from a post-hypnotic suggestion introduced during the REM phase and the ring placed on him while he was asleep.When faced with Prometheus, a man with a helmet that could download skills directly into his brain, Batman replaced the martial arts skills of the 30 martial artists Prometheus had downloaded with the physical skills and coordination of Professor Stephen Hawking. He’s pretty creative in the movies too. Batman Begins - Camouflage When Bruce has to complete his training by defeating, Ra's Al Ghul, Bruce's arm is cut. Bruce immediately considers this distinguishing injury, and then slits someone else's arm, causing Ra's to mistake another disciple for Bruce, granting Bruce a tactical advantage. In other words, instead of blending in with his environment, he changed his environment to blend in with him. Batman Forever - Coin Toss Batman takes advantage of his adversary's obsessive compulsion to make all his big decisions via coin toss. As the Two Face throws his coin into the air, Bruce hurls a handful of coins straight into his face, confusing the sharply dresses criminal with dozens of coins, all glittering through the air. This disrupts Two-Face's decision making process, allowing Bruce to prevail. The Dark Knight - Supercar Crash When Coleman Reese, Wayne Enterprises lawyer threatens to reveal Batman's secret identity, the Joker threatens to blow up a hospital unless someone kills him, his reason being that the revelation would ruin his fun. In order to save Reese's life while preserving his secret identity, Bruce runs a red light and crashes his sports car into Reese's convoy, causing security to tighten around Reese, preventing his untimely death. In addition, the idea of “The Batman” as a superhero is in and of itself a creative inversion of what superheroes were “supposed to be” at the time. While other heroes fought in the daylight, as shining beacons of hope, Batman was a symbol of terror and darkness, using fear as his primary weapon. The ideas themselves are what make Batman creative, not the means through which he realizes them. Tony can also be incredibly creative, but his best ideas are often the result of “eureka” moments as opposed to him actively coming up with them. (Probably not the best way to put it, but you get what I mean) I feel as though in terms of creativity, both are pretty even, taking into account everything they’ve been through, their ever increasing preparedness, (full on paranoia in Batman’s case) and their outlooks on life, with Batman having a slight edge, due to almost always having to outthink his opponents before he can stop them, the same happens to Tony, but on a less consistent basis, due to his tech being so formidable, But in terms of sheer inventiveness, Tony takes it. Bruce is no slouch when it comes to engineering, I mean the guy built a functioning Mother Box, but he’s no Tony Stark, Tony habitually designs new devices for solving problems that previously had no solution, Batman, while he does do the same on occasion, more often than not, elects to reverse engineer technology that he doesn't already have access to and/or or utilize what technology he does have access to in new ways, as opposed to designing new tech, unless he feels it absolutely necessary to create something completely new."},{"prompt":"What are useful free and opensource tools for devops and sysadmin folks?","completion":"There are literally tonnes of DevOps tools available online, but I would like to discuss the topmost and the most favorite tools opensource tools. (1) Kubernetes : This is an open source orchestration system for Docker containers. It's scheduling is handled onto nodes in a cluster and actively manages workloads, ensure that their state matches the users declared intentions. (2) Chef : Chef makes it easy to deploy servers and applications to any physical, virtual, or cloud location. The size of the infrastructure doesn't matter. (3) Puppet : Puppet Labs is one of the founding members of the DevOps movement and like Chef, it has moved beyond its original mission of configuration management and automation from single machines or instances to orchestration of the entire stack. Puppet helps the sysadmin community by building and sharing mature tools. This further helps in avoiding the duplication of everyone solving the same problem (4) Maven : Maven is a Yiddish word and it means \\"accumulator of knowledge\\". This tool is used for building and managing any Java-based project. It enables the developer to comprehend the complete state of a development effort in the shortest period of time. (5) OWASP : This tool is generally referred as the developers and DevOps best security friend. It makes software security visible. It enables individuals and organizations to make informed decisions regarding software security risks."},{"prompt":"w do you naturally boost your immune system at home?","completion":"There are many boosters suggested in our Ayurveda.

The secret will always be in how we think and feel while maintaining a connection between the two. I pasted two answers that I feel help explain what could be seen as the \\"secret\\" to weight loss. I'm happy to answer any questions! Keep it up! Second Answer: There are certain things to understand. I wish I could just straight up give you a quick answer. Here are the things to understand: (1) Body Fat is fat. You know how foods contain fat? Well, that fat when digested, {whatever fats not used for energy}, will get stored as body fat. Each macronutrient has a place to be stored. Fat (macronutrient) gets stored in our fat cells. They match. For anyone to say something otherwise is very misunderstood. People assume carbs equal fat right away. (2) Carbs do not make you fat, fat makes you “fat”. I’ll explain the parentheses. Carbs are stored as glycogen via liver and via muscle. *keep reading don’t stop because I said carbs don’t make you fat. Keep reading please. (3) This is where I explain the parentheses: The liver and the muscles contain glucose storages. Glucose all chilling together hanging out stored is/are called glycogen. When these storages become full, then glucose will spill over and get stored in our fat cells just like fat does. Why? The glucose “needs to go somewhere”, it’s not just gonna chill circulating around the body. (I’ll explain “needs to go somewhere” in point 6) FAT does not mean looking like Santa, fat is stored energy. Carbs only lead to fat gain when there is a spillover. Fats only lead to fat gain when that fat isn’t used for energy. *keep reading (4) Fats mixed with Carbs make you even more fat. I other words: Fats with Carbs can lead to retaining more fat. Remember fats get stored as fat and carbs will only get stored as fat once glycogen is full. Which means….if your glycogen is full and you combine carbs and fats in a meal…then yes, you will store more fat compared to eating just fats or carbs by itself. Why? Well, fats get stored as fat and then the carbs have to get stored as fat as well due to glycogen being full….that is stored fat from two sources, rather than just one. If your glycogen wasn’t full, then only the fats would get stored and the carbs would just go towards glycogen. This is my next point for you. (5) Glycogen levels. Ever heard of Keto Diet? This diet focuses on little to no carbs. Why? Glycogen levels. Most people eat too much food and most of these foods are carb based. Which means most people have filled glycogen levels. Which means most people are having glucose spill over into being stored as fat. By dropping carbs, we stop carbs from being stored as fat. By dropping carbs, we allow glycogen to become depleted which allows another opportunity to treat carbs better. By dropping carbs, we drop our calories, which should help one enter into a calorie deficit and it’s this deficit that helps more than anything. Make sense? (6) “Needs to go somewhere” This is where I explain the end of point 3. Insulin is not a fat storage hormone. Insulin simply transports, nutrients, into cells for energy and then stores the nutrients. Protein is not stored, they are recycled, this is why it’s wise to be consistent with protein. Fats are stored as fat. Carbs are stored as glycogen. IF GLYCOGEN is full then insulin will transport the excess glucose to body fat as the glucose needs to go somewhere. It’s not just gonna sit in the blood. If so, this calls for chaos. People that are insulin resistant usually have this chaotic issue. (7) Deficit and Surplus - remember how I said a deficit is usually the main cause for weight loss? A surplus is the main cause for weight gain. Remember this. (8) Storing fat from meals - this is something you should read carefully and think hard about. Because even though food will be used for energy, some will get stored as via glycogen or fat. If not glycogen then via fat from carbs and fat from fat. This stored fat from meals does not make us fat. Remember a surplus does. So what does this mean? If the fat stored from meals STAYS stored then yes you will gain because the body isn’t being given enough time to burn the stored fat for energy. If you do give the body time to burn the stored fat then this is called a deficit because you aren’t eating as much as you need. Since you aren’t eating as much as you need, your body will tap into the fat stored from meals and also your body fat. In a surplus, since you are always eating, you are always storing, so you will keep the fat stored from meals stationary while adding more fat due to the excess calories via the surplus. Make sense? So just because you store fat from meals doesn’t mean it makes you fat, the stored fat from meals only makes you fat IF IT STAYS STORED. Just be in a deficit so you burn it and you’re good. Which leads me to my next point (9) - Know your numbers. How can you lose or gain weight if you don’t know how much you are eating? Usually, people over eat rather than under eat. It’s safe to assume most people looking to lose weight simply just need to eat less. But, what is less? Less of what? It’s wise to know your numbers because this will help you gauge what’s going on. “Calories in vs calories out” is a tool to help you develop an understanding of what’s going on. Of what food contain what and how much, ect ect. Tracking/counting calories is not needed, but it sure does HELP SO MUCH. (10) Exercising - you talk about building muscle - this comes from breaking down the muscle and building it back up with protein. A surplus is not needed for muscle growth, protein is. I always say stick with 100g minimum so you’re consistent. 100g is 400 calories. Muscles need glucose to perform, so I would eat enough carbs to fill your glycogen levels to prepare for your next training. Then eat fats to cover the rest of the calories whether it’s a surplus or deficit. You can build muscle and lose weight in the same day, just not at the same time (I’ll explain in point 10). Building muscle = breaking down the muscle and rebuilding it with protein. Losing weight = a deficit. Tell me why this can’t happen? Some fear muscle loss during deficits. No. Eat protein. Eat a little more. Some think surpluses are needed to build muscle. No. A surplus leads to fat gain. Even if the excess calories come from protein. Everything has a number. Figure out what fits for you. This is why point 9 is important. (11) “you can’t burn fat (lose weight) and build muscle at the same time” - you can. Protein builds muscle. A deficit loses weight. What you can’t do is : You can’t burn fat and store fat at the same time as you burn, then store. You can’t lose weight and gain weight at the same time. BUT, you can do all this in a day. Ever heard “fat burning” stops if you eat carbs? This is because that body can’t burn carbs and burn fat at the same time. It has to be one or the other. So if you are always eating, then you eventually hit a surplus, because the body is always storing fat. It can’t even burn dietary fat and burn body fat at the same time. It’s one or the other. What does this mean? Eating less = burning less = storing less. May be hard to understand over text, but’s it’s the same as: eat carbs = burn carbs = store carbs AND eat fats = burn fats = store fats AND eat carbs and fats = burn carbs and fats = store carbs and fats. Ever head “sugar burner” vs “fat burner”. Well, which one are you eating more? Fats or Carbs? Bingo! Eat more carbs and you burn more carbs = sugar burner. Eat more fats and your burn more fats = fat burner. Make sense? Don’t worry about losing weight and building muscle at the same time, just hit each angle. Protein for muscle. Deficit for weight loss via fat. (12) Don’t fall for the hype. People say eggs contain too much fat. I egg is like 5g fat. Your total fat for your deficit or surplus is way more than that. Let’s say 70g total. How is 5g a lot of fat towards 70g? It’s not. Most foods are high in carbs which make it easy to fill glycogen and cause a spill over. Most people also eat carbs where they enter into a surplus. Most people just eat carbs. Most people eat too much and it’s mostly carbs. Keto likes to drop carbs so it makes sense for Keto to work on people that are in a surplus and eat too many carbs. But, really it’s just the not eating part that works. (13) Protein Powders are a nice way to squeeze in protein and protein only. I use carb powder to isolate carbs as well. Figure out which foods have what to make it easier on you. (14) Strive for 100oz of water and consume Micronutrients as these are just as important as macronutrients. Micronutrients help convert macronutrients into energy. It wouldn’t be wise to just eat without checking the nutrition label. This is most of what I can think of. It’s a lot, but at least it something. I could never find info like this when I was studying, so it’s nice to give back. I’ve read over this and apologize for any errors. If you need elaborating, just let me know. Keep it up! Third Answer: This is a great question. In order for one to take an approach, one must take action. Whether this be mentally, physically, or both. Reading is a great action to take, it helps us learn. This can be seen as an approach. If one cannot take the approach to learn ..then the specific approaches that I’m about to share, cannot be understood. By reading this, {you the requester and readers} have taken the first approach toward many other approaches. Pat yourself on the back and keep please reading. Here is my “approach” talk via “nutrient dense diets”: This question reminds me of a question I answered recently: “what is the healthiest way to lose weight?” My answer overall was: “I do believe one food can be more healthier than another, but that doesn’t make the other food not healthy”. It’s just a choice game, and we are in control of our choices. Your questions kinda ties everything together. You are already aware of “nutrient density” which is AWESOME. This is important because I believe one food may be more “healthier” over another due to its “nutrient density”. The other food is still healthy because it still contains nutrients, but the nutrients could be more dense…so this is why I think one food may be “healthier”, while the other just isn’t as “healthy”. It’s not, not healthy.. Make sense? Which leads to asking: what is “nutrient density”? Nutrient density is a term used to describe the amount of nutrients a food contains. If a food is high in nutrients, then this food is dense in nutrients. If a food is low in nutrients, then this food is not dense in nutrients. You included the word “diet” which means if a diet consists of foods that are dense in nutrients..then this is a “nutrient dense diet”. Make sense? Each food will have its own density amount of nutrients. It’s our job to know which foods have what and how much of each nutrient. Thankfully nutrition labels exist to help us figure out what’s going on. Nutrients are not just proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. They are also vitamins, minerals, and water. Fats, Carbs, and Proteins, are our macronutrients (macros), while vitamins, minerals, and water are our micronutrients (micros). Which leads to me talking about food choices: I fortunately remember the nutrition label for many foods. If it doesn’t have a label, I remember what I’ve studied. It just sticks mentally and saves me time as I don’t have to input my calories via tracking. I use to track calories (started like 5yrs ago) which did help me get a better understanding (started to remember within 6m) of which foods had what and at what amount. I chose to remember so I can choose foods that contain more “nutrients” aka “energy”. I noticed some food weren’t doing what I thought. I focused a lot on my macros and not my micros. It was when I started to increase my micronutrients that things started to change. The foods I use to eat weren’t doing what I thought they would because they were low in micronutrients. Along my starting stages of learning I was always told and always heard: “EAT”. So I did, but just eating didn’t work. It was when I shifted my focus onto figuring out why these foods weren’t working. I wasn’t staying full. I was getting bloated. I wasn’t recovering as fast. I wasn’t drinking enough water. Not even close. I ate my carbs, but lacked fiber which is a carb. I wasn’t taking vitamins, not even in supplement form. I soon realized the foods I were eating weren’t very nutritious, even though they were high in calories and/or helped me get to my calorie surplus. When I fixed this, everything changed. I now can eat those foods, while eating the new foods I learned about. So today currently, I pretty much have a good list of foods I consume. I eat at specific times, usually. I have nutrients at certain times, usually. Which leads to “nutrient timing”. What is “nutrient timing”? Nutrient timing is when we eat at specific times. Or at least consume foods during certain moments throughout the day. If your calorie total is 1,700, all that matters is fitting in the 1,700 before the day ends, BUT…I feel manipulating some of those calories through timing can/could help with health, recovery, and longevity. Let me try to give simple explanation: (1) Water - I drink this all the time. Mainly in the morning. Doesn’t it make sense to hydrate upon waking up? I use to get nauseous, but that was because of a poor “diet”/food choices. Now, it’s like a filtering fluid at this time of day (morning). I drink it all day, but I have like 1 water bottle every hour. It’s easy to remember and to do (well, for me). We should aim for around 100oz of water, consuming all this in one time would suck. So “timing” water (which is a nutrient) is considered “nutrient timing”. (2) Carbohydrates- I use this to refill my liver and muscle glycogen. Not that I’m “dry empty”, but because I train and training for muscle growth uses mainly glucose for energy. Carbs are the best source for glucose. Study carbs deeper and you will notice different level rates of digestion, which means….carbs themselves have their own “timing”, but at the end of the day all carbs (complex or simple) become GLUCOSE. I consciously consume carbs before training because it helps, if I sense I don’t need them, then I will skip carbs because I am “filled up” enough. But, post workout, I FOR SURE, consciously consume as many carbs as I can to make sure I “refill” my glycogen levels via liver and muscle. The body can only store a certain amount of carbs before they body stores them as fat, so I usually eat up to that amount and continue with fats and protein to hit my surplus. With all this said…I am “timing” carbohydrates (a nutrient), which makes all this “nutrient timing”. (3) Protein - this is a very important nutrient (macro) as the body doesn’t really store protein. It recycles protein as we are mainly protein, so it makes sense for protein metabolism/catabolism to be equally constant…which means we should make sure to be consuming protein via food or supplements (food over supplements) to keep up with this process. If we aren’t consuming protein, then the body will be forced to mostly use it own protein (muscle) for energy. Sure, amino acids help via BCAA vs EAA, but whole protein (complete) combines every amino acid. Certain foods are complete, while some are lightly complete. So strive to eat foods that collectively create whole protein (complete). I also suggest no less then 100g of protein just to play things safe and then manipulate (adjust amount) upon determination. I could go on with other nutrients, but I hope I made a point with those three. So again, the best approach would be to learn. To study. To educate. To know. To remember. It helps. Knowledge can be power if you can conceptualize the energy in a progressive manner. Information is key. Information is the best approach. This makes me think of another question I recently answered: “how do I motivate myself to get in shape”. My answer simply was to read. I feel reading helps motivate us. Which can lead into a habit. It can be tough to become motivated to learn and read, but we need to take this action. I’m motivated to write this because I enjoy explaining things so it helps people understand better. One can practice turning motivation into habits by “waking up”. It can be tough to wake up in the morning (even worse at a certain/different time than one is use to). If one can accomplish waking up when tired, this to me, seems to help accomplishments by that energy being rolled onto other “goals”. It’s hard again because one is use to waking up when they have been usually waking up. Since they “usually” wake up at a certain time, this means they have repeatedly did something over and over. It’s time to try and do some else over and over. Just put the pieces together as this is a puzzle and you shall develop your approaches. Hope this helps! Keep it up. Here is another answer regarding “fasting”. Does it work? Yes and No. I’ll explain. Fasting is for when we sleep. When we sleep, we are not eating. Fasting is also a religious practice. We should only be fasting during our sleep. The ONLY reason fasting would help one lose weight is because fasting creates less time for one to consume food. Less time eating, hopefully gets one into a deficit. And the deficit is the ONLY and TRUEST cause for weight loss. So, fasting feeds into a deficit. People that fast during the day have it all wrong. I understand why they are doing it and my understanding is not the same understanding they have. People that fast, “think” they are “burning fat” or somehow have “magically” entered into some sort of a fat/weight loss “dimension”. (1) You could be burning stored glucose (glycogen). (2) Even if you were burning fat, who’s to say you aren’t going to ruin that time not eating by eating more later? Point number two is important. Again, fasting creates less time to eat, which technically shortens the day. Meaning, because you fasted, you now have less time to eat for the remainder of the day. BUT. WHAT IF…you eat more calories later in the little time left in the day? What if you ate enough to kick you out of a deficit? This would mean you fasted for no real reason. Most people that fast do this. They fast and get high off the placebo and then ruin it by eating more later. But, this can be prevented….because it’s not even needed. Fasted is for when we sleep. People just eat too damn much. So much that they are not truly fasting during sleep anymore. People consume more energy than their body requires…don’t you think this will effect sleep? Sleep cycles? Sleep metabolism? Yes, it will. So people fast during the day and cause chaos for the body, mind, and soul. Why? Because you shouldn’t be fasting during the day, you should be organized with your calories and allow fasting to happen “naturally”. But, I get it. People fast. It happens. But, there is a “proper” way of going about “fasting” IF you are going to implement it. If you are going to fast, FAST FROM CARBS. What’s the point of fasting? To decrease calories. Even if you burn stored fat, decreasing calories will burn more fat then fasting can directly. And…if there is a chance of burning glycogen, why not just drop carbs? Dropping carbs is dropping calories. Not that carbs are bad, but it makes sense to drop calories via carbs, if not via carbs only. We only have fats, proteins, and carbs to work with. We could drop a little of each, but I don’t feel like explaining why that is nonsense. Dropping protein only would be nonsense as protein is like vital vital.Dropping fats would be nonsense as fats are the best source of energy and very much needed for bodily functions. Dropping carbs is not nonsense because carbs are not even essential, which means we can manipulate them to our advantage. Dropping carbs will: (1) Decrease Overall Calories (2) Restore Glycogen Levels (3) Improve Insulin Sensitivity …..oh wait, am I describing the Keto Diet? ;) Yes, but I didn’t start off with saying Keto, because Keto is a buzzword. You need to understand why Keto does what it does. I would have someone start with Keto for the reasons mentioned above, but I would not have them on it long. Carbs are not essential, but they are helpful. Especially, if someone is on Keto trying to build muscle. Or in just in a deficit. If anything, Atkins is where I would lead someone after doing Keto. ONE MORE THING: Fasting while on Keto is major nonsense. - Hope this helps! Keep it up."},{"prompt":"Why did Dr B.R. Ambedkar hate Hinduism?","completion":"Imagine You are a child and Your own hindu teacher throws you out of the classroom because you belong to a particular caste, You do not get to drink water in school from touching a pot/glass, the hindu peon pours water in your mouth. Your do not get a hair cut because the Hindu barber believes that his razor will be impure. You become adult and The files you work with will be refused to be touched because they have become impure. These are just samples of discrimination Ambedkar faced. If you only get hatred from your own religious people then can you love back that religion ? Love is reciprocated with love and hatred with hatred. Dalits today face discrimination and hatred in the same way. OBCs are stupid who believe they are not being discriminated until they face a professor in viva, interviewer in an interview , employee for referrals or renter for a home. So you can call Ambedkar anti-hindu, anti -India independence, reservationist divider but his name will be recalled every-time a lower caste is beaten ,raped, denied housing /job/services, . You can not kill Ambedkar and his ideas because except upper caste men , rest of the Hindus are suffering because of caste. I also never cared about caste or discrimination until I faced it myself.Every-time I am prepared to face discrimination, I remember Ambedkar how psychologically strong he was even after years of discrimination. It gives me hope and strength because I know just like him caste abolitionist are always standing on higher ground of morality than caste identarians. 95% hindus do not marry outside their caste even though genetic diseases like sickle cell is spreading like wild fire, I wonder how many hindus will survive this millennium with the advent of Artificial Intelligence and lack of cooperation."},{"prompt":"Mathematicians, how did you become so exceptionally great at maths?

The World Wide Web, which was invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, made it possible to access vast amounts of information through hyperlinks. The second technology that has become an essential part of modern life is the smartphone. Smartphones have revolutionized the way we communicate, work, and access information. They come equipped with advanced features such as high-resolution cameras, internet connectivity, and mobile apps. Another technology that has the potential to transform our lives is artificial intelligence (AI). AI-powered technologies such as autonomous vehicles, intelligent virtual assistants, and predictive analytics are already making significant impacts on society. Nuclear power is another advanced technology that can produce vast amounts of energy with minimal greenhouse gas emissions. However, it also poses significant safety and environmental risks. Finally, space exploration has led to many technological advancements, including satellite technology, GPS, and advanced materials.

The world is governed by a complex web of political, economic, and social systems, with power distributed among various entities and individuals. Here are some key players that exert influence on a global scale: 1. Governments and political leaders: Nation-states play a significant role in shaping global affairs, with their policies, laws, and diplomatic relations impacting international dynamics. 1. International organizations: Entities such as the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Trade Organization (WTO), and regional bodies like the European Union (EU) have influence in setting global agendas and policies. 1. Corporations and business leaders: Multinational corporations possess significant economic power and can influence governments and shape global markets. Business leaders and CEOs have considerable influence over economic decisions and policies. 1. Financial institutions: Central banks, commercial banks, and other financial institutions have a significant impact on global economies, monetary policies, and financial stability. 1. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs): NGOs, such as Amnesty International, Greenpeace, and Doctors Without Borders, focus on various issues such as human rights, environmental protection, and humanitarian aid. They often advocate for change and influence global agendas. 1. Media and technology giants: Media organizations, social media platforms, and technology companies play a crucial role in shaping public opinion, disseminating information, and influencing societal norms. 1. Influential individuals: Prominent figures, including philanthropists, thought leaders, intellectuals, and activists, can exert considerable influence through their ideas, wealth, or social influence. It's important to note that power dynamics and the entities that influence global affairs can vary across different regions and contexts. The world is a complex and interconnected system, and power is distributed among various actors rather than being concentrated in the hands of a single entity or group."},{"prompt":"Which is the best travel portal development company?","completion":"Hi, There are many travel portal development companies available in India, so according to me in the market there are huge competition among each other, so it is up to the customers that which one is better according to their needs and demands.

Though we’re often told not to judge a book by its cover, our opinions are often informed by our first impressions. This is also the case with storefront window displays. So, how does a brick and mortar store grab a passerby’s attention? These ten companies gained recognition for their creatively dressed window displays. 1. Gucci Image Credit: [LINKED_TEXT: WindowsWear] [URL: https://www.windowswear.com/] While most window displays feature mannequins facing the audience on the street, Gucci’s mannequins inhabit the audience themselves. As a part of their Hallucination Campaign, Gucci revived famous paintings by adding Gucci outfits to the characters in the art piece. Sitting with their backs to the street, the mannequins enjoy the paintings on the screens. Others can join in by downloading the Gucci app, where they can enjoy the paintings through Augmented Reality. This not only brings the window display to life, but also allows customers to experience the Gucci products through different mediums. 2. Cole Hardware Image Credit: [LINKED_TEXT: Jun Belen] [URL: http://blog.junbelen.com/2009/10/27/which-broom/] Many stores decorate their window display around an upcoming holiday. Unlike the other stores who celebrate Halloween by adding pumpkins to their window display, Cole Hardware used the holiday to market its collection of brooms. The Cole Hardware brooms were in flying position as they floated along an orange backdrop. The company then capped this off by asking onlookers: “Which broom?” It’s a creative way to showcase products in connection to a holiday theme. 3. Galeries Lafayette Image Credit: [LINKED_TEXT: Creative Bloq] [URL: https://www.creativebloq.com/graphic-design/window-display-1012920] This french department store created a competition for children ages 5 to 11 to draw their Christmas hero.

Through this competition, Galeries Lafeyette actively involved customers in the store experience and created a window display that captured childhood wonderment, perfect for a Christmas-themed display. 4. Barney's Image Credit: [LINKED_TEXT: Creative Bloq] [URL: https://www.creativebloq.com/graphic-design/window-display-1012920] Who says windows need to stick to the snapshot display? Barney’s ditched the mannequins for ice carving collective [LINKED_TEXT: Okamoto Studio] [URL: http://www.okamotostudionyc.com/]. Passerby got to look on as Okamoto Studio carved ice sculptures in the storefront window. Setting up their window display as an ice carving exhibition helped Barney’s increase the average stay at their storefront. 5. Isabel Marant Image Credit: [LINKED_TEXT: Pinterest] [URL: https://www.pinterest.com/] Just by placing three images alongside three different dresses, this window display tells a story. It’s simple, yet aesthetically pleasing. After displaying all three dresses, the takeaway of grouping them together communicates: Which dress will you choose? It effectively characterizes each of the dress styles without dipping into the overdone text description. Remember: show, don’t tell. 6. LaGalleria Image Credit: [LINKED_TEXT: Creative Bloq] [URL: https://www.creativebloq.com/graphic-design/window-display-1012920] Besides for the typical sprucing up for a holiday geared display, many stores decorate their window displays in accordance with a theme. LaGalleria, an Armenian boutique, chose to present a jungle theme window display, designed by retail marketing specialist Davit Muradyan. In the jungle atmosphere, LaGalleria’s products remain the focus. Note their use of pedestals to elevate their smaller products (bags and shoes) to ensure they catch the passerby’s attention. 7. Saks Fifth Avenue x Vetements Image Credit: [LINKED_TEXT: WindowsWear] [URL: https://www.windowswear.com/] In collaboration with French design collective Vetements, Saks portrayed the wastefulness of fast fashion by displaying a pile of old clothing. To highlight the issues of consumerism and excess, Saks added more to the pile each day. Instead of using the window to display their products, Saks used it to display their brand, a brand with a conscience. 8. Tiffany & Co. Image Credit: [LINKED_TEXT: Facebook] [URL: https://www.facebook.com/Tiffany/photos/a.10155361209888068/10155361210783068/?type=3&theater] Tiffany & Co. is known for its holiday window displays. Their [LINKED_TEXT: Winter Wonderland] [URL: https://www.facebook.com/pg/Tiffany/photos/?tab=album&album_id=10155361209888068] captured different holiday scenes, using miniature ice pedestals and carts of presents to display their jewelry. Tiffany & Co. doesn’t just pull out all the stops for the holidays. To celebrate the premiere of The Great Gatsby in 2012, Tiffany & Co. designed a window display that captured the opulence and decadence of the roaring ‘20s. They followed with a Great Gatsby jewelry collection. 9. Hermes Image Credit: [LINKED_TEXT: Creative Bloq] [URL: https://www.creativebloq.com/graphic-design/window-display-1012920] Paper sculptures [LINKED_TEXT: Zim and Zou] [URL: https://www.zimandzou.fr/] created a window display for Hermes. Every article in the display was crafted by hand using only paper and leather. Store owners often benefit from partnering with artists on their window displays. After all, window displays are where art meets business. Image Credit: [LINKED_TEXT: Creative Bloq] [URL: https://www.creativebloq.com/graphic-design/window-display-1012920] 10. Kate Spade x Ebay Image Credit: [LINKED_TEXT: Creative Bloq] [URL: https://www.creativebloq.com/graphic-design/window-display-1012920] Kate Spade teamed up with eBay to create a window display for the modern age. You don’t have to walk into the store to buy the items in the window case. Rather, you can buy the displayed items straight from your phone. Interactive and creative, Kate Spade ups their game by embracing technology. Are you inspired to revamp your own window display?

It certainly makes no sense to imagine that if we used more than 10% of our brains, we would acquire superhuman powers. If this were so, nature would select for genes that enabled us to use more than 10% of our brains from the get-go. What is more, different areas of the brain tend to specialize in different tasks.

For this answer, I would like to challenge our thinking with some geological findings that are available for all of us to check out—findings that I believe support the historicity of the worldwide Flood described in Genesis 6–9. For over 50 years now, geologists have been studying “megasequences” (also called “Sloss sequences”, named after Lawrence Sloss who first brought our attention to them, in 1963). Megasequences are discrete groupings of sedimentary rock strata (“facies”)—primarily, groupings of sandstone, shale, and limestone layers, that are bounded by layers of erosion called “uncomformities.” Six megasequences have been discovered—massive layers of sedimentary rock groupings found on all the continents. In North America, they have been given the names of Native American tribes. From the deepest to the shallowest, they are the Sauk, the Tippecanoe, the Kaskakia, the Absarokee, the Zuni, and the Tejas. And each bears evidence of “transgression” and “regression”—that is, evidence of being driven by ocean water at least partly across the continents (“transgression”), then back across as the waters receded back to the ocean. And, regardless of which continent, the degree of sediment coverage of each megasequence is roughly the same, with few exceptions. For example, the Sauk megasequence ocean water transgressed to about the same degree over each continent. The megasequences correspond to the “geologic column” with its chronostratigraphy. And, in fact, many geologists believe that the megasequences are explained by the slow, gradual rise and fall of ancient seas, over hundreds of millions of years. And so, they remain faithful to the evolutionary interpretation of the geologic column. However, other geologists see these megasequences as the product of a single worldwide catastrophic Flood which covered the earth for a little over a year, as described in the Bible. So, what model—hundreds of millions of years, or one year—do the geological data point to? First, notice what each model proposes in regard to the ocean water dynamics. The evolutionary model (“hundreds of millions of years”) proposes that the six megasequences represent six successive floodings of the earth as ocean waters slowly, gradually covered the earth, scooping up, then depositing on each continent, layers of sediment from the ocean floor—and doing this over a span of about 500 million years. In fact, they have proposed that in the flooding of the first megasequence—the Sauk—ocean waters rose only at the rate of 1 foot per 20 years (that is only .01 inch per week!). On the other hand, the biblical Flood model, with its plate tectonics (“the fountains of the great deep—that is, the ocean—burst open”) plus sudden dumping of water from the sky (“the floodgates of the sky were opened”), combined to cause turbulent, catastrophic flooding of the earth, with each megasequence driven by a mega-tsunami that easily scooped up not only ocean floor sediments but also ocean floor ecosystems, transporting, then depositing them great distances across the continents. So, which model better fits the actual data? According to geologists, over 3.3 million cubic kilometers of sediment were deposited across North America alone, during the Sauk megasequence. So, what was the area covered by this deposit? Let’s trace the deposit we know as the Tapeats Sandstone, in the Grand Canyon; this was the bottom layer of the Sauk megasequence. The Tapeats Sandstone is traced across Arizona, northwest into Canada, and northeasterly right across the U.S.A. to Maine. The same layer of sandstone takes up again in southern Israel, into Egypt, and across Africa! Now…which model better accounts for this massive spread of ocean sediment and ocean life—the evolutionary model with its very slow and gradual rise of ocean waters (1 foot/20 years…which is only .01 inch/ week!)? Is this the kind of “rush” of ocean water that could actually scoop up 3.3 million cubic kilometers of sediment from the ocean floor and drive it across the United States, from coast to coast? Is this the kind of water dynamics that would displace and transport boulders one mile in diameter? Or…wouldn’t such a deposit require much stronger, faster, and more turbulent water dynamics—catastrophic forces…as accounted for in the biblical Flood? And consider another aspect of the data we all can see: the upper and lower boundaries of each megasequence consist of eroded rock—each boundary called an “unconformity.” However, between the rock layers that make up each megasequence, there is no erosion; rather, the boundaries between these rock layers are sharp and well-defined; these layers sit “tight” upon one another. So, which model does this data fit better? The evolutionary model? Or the Flood model? According to the evolutionary model, millions of years separate each layer within each megasequence. In other words, there would be millions of years of erosion between each rock layer within each megasequence. On the other hand, according to the Flood model, the erosion characterizing each unconformity was caused by powerful, catastrophic water flow that not only scooped up and drove clastic (fragmentary) rock, but even caused much of the fragmenting. And according to the Flood model, each rock layer of each megasequence was laid quickly, one upon another, so that there was no erosion between them…thus, producing tightly fitted layers, just as we see in the Grand Canyon. Check it out: either go to the Grand Canyon, or pull up Google images to see the Muav Limestone layer, tightly seated upon the Bright Angel Shale, tightly seated upon the Tapeats Sandstone (these layers form the Sauk megasequence). No erosion between these layers. This beautifully fits the biblical Flood model—but not the evolutionary model."},{"prompt":"What was the strangest fast food order you've seen?","completion":"From what I've read in a few answers, burger people are the weirdest, and I hate to be a broken record, but here I go. I work at Twisted Root Burger, and we have a list of “specialty” burgers. Basically it's a list of burgers that have specific toppings, versus the option of a B.Y.O.B. (Build Your Own Burger). Now, one of those specialty burgers is an “All-American”. It's a single 1/2 pound patty, with double American cheese and 2 strips of bacon. That's it, besides the lettuce and onion that come on the side. Condiments are also on the side, at the table. A customer came in one day and asked the cashier for an “All-American” with no cheese and no bacon. The cashier asked if they wanted a regular burger, they said “No, I want an All-American, with no cheese, and no bacon.” Cashier tried explaining again and again, that without cheese and bacon, it'd be a plain, regular burger. Finally, they emphatically insisted that they didn't want a “plain burger”, and that all they wanted was an “ALL-AMERICAN WITH NO CHEESE OR BACON.” SO, that's what the cashier rang up. They paid the extra 2 just to have the toppings taken off. I thought ordering a cheeseburger with no cheese was only a bad joke, but apparently some people really just don't care about wasting their money."},{"prompt":"Does a fluorescent light fixture use more energy than an incandescent?","completion":"No, they use less. They require a ballast and starter initially but, less power once they light. New lights are LED, using even less power than fluorescent."},{"prompt":"w can we find stocks for swing trading and positional trading?","completion":"Hello Traders, There are many different strategies in the market that people are using nowadays, but the safe is positional trading/swing trading. The main benefit of positional trading is that it gives you the freedom to use multiple trading styles. You can practice intraday and swing trading depending on the market trends with positional trading. Positional trading also allows you to make the most out of the huge movements in the stocks over weeks and months. POSITIONAL TRADING: You run a higher risk per trade in positional trading since you invest larger amounts on each trade. In addition, since you hold on to your trades for longer periods, you increase the risk of your trade being affected by adverse news or events. In intraday trading, you run a different kind of risk. The primary difference between position trading and swing trading is the amount of time involved between buying an asset and selling it. Whereas position traders hold assets for long periods, such as months or years, swing traders will buy and sell assets within days. Positional trading strategies While position trading may appear to be easy, it requires deep fundamental and technical research, as well as a solid grasp of the markets. Here are a few strategies to help you trade more effectively: Support and Resistance Trading- Support and resistance indicators can assist you in determining if the price of an asset is likely to fall into a downward trend, or grow into an upward trend. Depending on this evaluation, you may determine whether to start a long position and profit from weekly, monthly, or yearly rising prices or a short position and profit from price reductions that last for a long time. When trying to ascertain support and resistance levels, the following three major factors must be considered. The most dependable source of support and resistance levels is historical pricing. Previous levels of support and resistance serve as indicators of future trends. Technical indicators that might provide dynamic support and resistance levels that fluctuate in response to the price of a certain asset. Breakout Trading Strategy- Breakout trading entails attempting to open trade during the early phases of a trend. Typically, a breakout strategy serves as the foundation for trading large-scale market swings. A breakout trader, like a support and resistance trader, will normally start a long position once the stock price breaks just above the resistance line, or a short position after the stock goes down below the support level. As a result, to be a great breakout trader, you must be familiar with spotting levels of support and resistance. 50-Day Moving Average Trading- The 50-Day Moving Average Indicator is among the most important indicators in positional trading. 50 is a factor to both 100 and 200, which are moving averages representing important long-term trends. Whenever the 50-Day Moving Average indication crosses with the 100 and 200-Day Moving Average indicators, it may signify the beginning of a new long-term trend, making it a useful indication for positional traders. The stop-loss in a trade executed using this approach is set immediately below the most recent swing down.Pullback and retracement trading strategy- A pullback is a small drop or retreat in an asset's current rising trend. Pullback trading allows traders to profit on declines or delays in the upward trajectory of an asset's price. The goal is to purchase undervalued stocks and sell them after the asset has recovered from the setback and resumes its upward trajectory. Pullbacks are frequently alluded to as retracements, although they are not the same as reversals. A technical indicator called Fibonacci retracement can help you evaluate whether a market decline is a pullback or a reversal. When it comes to screening the stocks, I have been following many things which should be considered by all the traders and the stock market passionate ones. Focus on Price action- Price action in trading analyses the performance of a security, or index to predict what it might do in the future. If your price action analysis tells you that the price is about to rise, you might want to take a long position, or if you believe that the price will fall, you might choose to short the asset.Trend Analysis of the underlying asset- Share Market Trend or equity market trend analysis is the process of analyzing current trends to predict future trends. Share market trend analysis is an aspect of technical analysis that tries to predict the future movement of a stock based on past dataIndustry or sectoral analysis- When it comes to taking the long or short position, I would always prefer to analyze the industry trend and industry performance in the quarter or in a particular time frame. With the help of monitoring the industry performance, we can focus on particular selected stocks for intraday and positional trading.Having initial guidance from a proper research analyst about trading- No doubt, that no one has huge knowledge to trade initially in the market, only the experienced could be the winner at last. About that always try to seek knowledge from experienced research analysts by which you can get overall trading strategies to screen the selected stocks for trading. To be honest, I have been seeking service from EQWIRES RESEARCH ANALYST, however, in my trading initial stage, I have been gaining a commendable service and gains of knowledge financially as well. Here I want to share my experience with them, They gave me a buy call on Maruti Jan future 2 weeks back around 8300 with the target of 8700–8800–8900. I bought a Maruti Jan Fut at 8295.10 and exited at 8695.10 with a profit of 40,000/-. Would be glad to share the snapshot in the attachment of this answer. All in all, learned innumerable things about positional trading and the patience to keep in that.Make a grip on 5–7 Stocks only- In trading always try to understand the 5–7 stocks only, and never try to switch to another stock by seeing any DIP of following any tip. Try to trade in selected stocks by which you can get the experience of the above-mentioned techniques. Advantages of position trading strategies Positional trading is a long-term strategy that can yield significant gains.The positional trading strategy takes advantage of large stock moves spanning weeks and months.Because positions do not need to be examined daily, the trader is less concerned than with certain short-term techniques.The positional trading strategy simply necessitates time spent analyzing probable stocks, leaving greater time for other transactions or professional duties. Disadvantages of position trading strategies As the saying goes, while every activity has advantages, it also has its own set of disadvantages. Similarly, a position trading strategy has its own set of drawbacks that you should be aware of before engaging in trade: As transactions might run for several months, a large amount of cash is required to keep positions open for an extended length of time.Transfer expenses can quickly add up if the position is open for an extended length of time.The positional trading strategy also necessitates the investor's capital being locked up for extended periods. It is thus advised that you get your risk profile assessed before venturing into the realm of positional trading.Deposits are required since trading positions with small amounts of money is impossible. As a result, large price changes are more likely to result in a total loss of invested cash. To identify market movement, positional traders rely heavily on fundamental and technical research. Positional trading may be a good alternative to trading stocks if done properly with analysis and understanding. These strategies aren't simple to implement, especially for novice investors, but if you're just getting started with positional trading, these positional trading strategies help you feel more confident in your decisions. Positional trading can be a great alternative to day trading if you trade with accurate knowledge and research. It helps the traders in visualizing market sentiments which in turn helps them to position themselves safely and advantageously. It cycles in both directions and helps understand market sentiments and their modifications. It captures build-up and loss of momentum that helps the intraday trader in designing a trading strategy.

But, over the time I realized that an issue with learning from them is that they being ‘free and open for all’ community, attract lots of creators who are considering to make a quick buck. Content quality of such tutorials is questionable. Also, one cannot prove one’s grasp on the subject to potential employers due to no provision of obtaining certification for the courses completed on those platforms. This may hinder one’s career, especially in cases where employer has set a criteria of choosing candidates with relevant degree/certificate. Moreover, in several resources I found that while solving questions, the author applies logic/technique that has not been taught yet. This leads the learner to skip to those sections of the tutorial, where that particular topic is discussed. The concepts taught in those sections in turn apply logic that belongs to another concept discussed in a different section. Often, this is a repetitive cycle.

An informed answer to this question would require a lot of searching through interviews or biographies of both artists. Something may exist, somewhere but use nothing of which I'm aware. What I can offer in terms of a comment is the duality of Black artist's feelings about Elvis and other White artist's appropriation of Rhythm and Blues at the beginning of Rock and Roll. I think there has to be simultaneous regard and disdain since Elvis is responsible for a lot of the mainstream success of Rock and Roll. His performance and image, while controversial, was significant since it kicked open the doors of this genre to the White audience who were already paying attention, albeit shamefully, to Black artists. Therefore, Elvis did two things. He was the biggest artist in the world appropriating Black music and he was the biggest artist in the world making it possible for Black artists to achieve mainstream recognition.

This is at least partly as a result of Canadian Governments being more socially conscious and supporting real equal rights for everyone ,so citizens feel better living here.

Developed the line of anti-ship missiles, the Hsiung Feng (Brave Wind in English). This enables the ease of ability to shoot and sink Chinese ships trying to cross the strait during the time of invasion.2. Developed the line of surface to air missiles, the Tien Kung (Sky Bow in English). This enables Taiwan to shoot down Chinese air forces, the latest version III also has the ability to shoot down ballistic missiles (similar to Patriot).3. Developed the line of beyond visual range air to air missiles, the Tien Chien (Sky Sword in English). This enables Taiwan’s air force to engage China’s air force.4. Developed the short range ballistic missile, the Tien Chi (Sky Spear in English). This is a surface to surface missile obviously, of a ballistic type, it has a range of 300km and thus enables it to strike targets in China’s Fujian and southern Zhejiang provinces.5. Developed a different version of Hsiung Feng that is a land attack cruise missiles, known as the Hsiung Feng IIE. This is a cruise missile with a range of 600km (but an improved range version has a range of 1200km). This weapon enables Taiwan to precision strike high value targets in China.6. Developed the supersonic cruise missile, the Yun Feng (Cloud Peak in English). This is a supersonic cruise missile with a range of 1200km, and an extended range variant has a massive range of 2000km. This in fact is one of the better cruise missiles that exist in the world in fact, it enables Taiwan to strike targets very deep within China, it means even Xi and his cronies wouldn’t be safe. This is precision guided, it can strike a target the size of a car from 2000km away.7. Developed the air launched cruise missile, the Wan Chien (Ten Thousands Swords in English). This is a cruise missile fired from a jet, it can strike land targets from 240km away, however an upgraded version now has a range of 400km. Taiwan’s jets can thus strike Chinese land targets from a long distance away with this air launched cruise missile. What else could Taiwan do? Below are my opinions about additional things Taiwan could do, to become even more formidable. * Develop 1000 ton small diesel-electric submarines equipped with lithium batteries, produce 20 of these. * Develop a 30km range LWT for these submarines, secretly meet with the Japanese engineers of the type 12 LWT in order to gain technical knowledge in producing such a torpedo, this torpedo being a surface striking torpedo for operations in noisy coastal waters (perfect for Taiwan to strike Chinese surface ships trying to cross the strait). * Secretly develop a very specialised deep entry point submarine base, to house these submarines. You see Taiwan is very small and heavily surveilled, therefore China will know the locations of regular submarine bases (because you can blatantly see the submarines come and go). To solve this, Taiwan should develop on its eastern coast (very deep rocky drop off into the ocean), a deep entry point to an underground submarine base. This base should be constructed in secret under the surface guise of a large warehouse. I have made a basic picture below to sort of show the concept. See below, an example from China, this is why shallow entry point bases are not good. Above you can see a Chinese submarine entering what was unknown to be a submarine base until satellites captured it entering this area. This submarine ..."},{"prompt":"ello! My Aiwa compact disc stereo cassette receiver’s cd drawer will not fully close. It is jammed somehow but I can’t figure out how. What should I do?","completion":"Typical of this problem, are among the following. There is a very small belt on most CD drawers. You may be able to see it underneath the tray by holding the tray as it closes and it will give up trying to close. The belt can often wear out, requiring replacement or maybe cleaning it with Q tip and Alcohol. There is another solution, called Rubber Regrip. Both of these are again temporary solutions, the real solution is to replace the belt. The other reason would be that dirt or a piece of paper is stuck in the drive, that is keeping the drawer to fully close. Finally a rare reason is that there are one or 2 leaf switches are broken, maybe bent, that tell the electronics that the drawer is fully closed or fully open. Those require taking it all apart to replace or bend or fix them usually. On some drawers there is a plastic clip you bend in order to fully remove the tray. I have fixed many CD/DVD computer drives, which are similar and most of them were the slipping belt problem. Partly because not only does it have to close the drawer, but it has to raise and lower the Spindle that clamps the CD/DVD into place. Very rarely there could be a piece of broken CD or plastic in the drive causing problems. Some DVD would do this and can happen when the laser wears out also."},{"prompt":"w make money with affiliate marketing?","completion":"The best way to start making money online with affiliate marketing involves a strategic approach and a focus on building a strong foundation for your affiliate business.

When they do, the first proof may also be found that mankind’s earliest ancestors — the genetically-manipulated people, or rather their descendants — were refugees and exiles who originated in the Sirius regions. This proof will shake up the scientific community and, even more so, the religious world; it will prompt the need for great changes. That moment will come chiefly when artifacts from a previous human civilization are found on Mars, with pyramids and sculptures such as the so-called Mars faces representing but a mere fraction of the entire discovery. The findings and the message to terrestrials regarding the discoveries on Mars will be the factors one day in the collapse of the legendary picture the terrestrials’ former ancestors had formed of their heritage. Many negators of the truth will realize with frightening clarity that terrestrial Man did not originate on the planet Earth and, furthermore, he is not the only human life form in the Universe… Mars star map by Wayne Herschel …Nonetheless, space exploration will continue and a new world discovered in this process; a new Earth that will be suitable for maintaining human terrestrials. The actual period when space travel and with its many related discoveries commence will begin already in the very near future, however. Overall, expeditions into space will be successful, e.g., terrestrials will discover, or rather locate, ancient human traces and effects left behind on Mars. This will present sufficient reason for terrestrials to build, furbish and fly new spaceships with even greater ranges into the vastness of space, to make ever greater, more interesting and, especially, more significant discoveries. Initially, these spaceships will travel over relatively long periods of time until propulsion systems are developed that make super-speed space travel without time shifts feasible. Spaceships reaching velocities above the speed of light, indeed, speeds several million times the speed of light, will one day become the rule. But until this occurs, several hundreds of years, even millennia, will pass. Still, these aforementioned predictions shall occur in the near and somewhat more distant future and mankind will not be kept waiting too much longer; even elderly people alive today will experience the commencement of these predictions.

In just a few years, our company has become a regional leader in the direct marketing field. Back in 2012, email marketing was drastically different from what it is to date. In fact, it was limited to sending out promotional emails — the more, the better. Most emails were, in fact, SPAM. It wasn’t unusual for businesses to buy and sell email lists. There were few to no professionals able to leverage data for customer communications. Marketing automation and personalization weren’t even on the table. The ever-evolving business world required businesses to take a fundamentally new approach to customer communications. This called for a fundamentally new email marketing service that would help businesses establish and maintain fruitful relationships with their customers. That’s why I developer had to evolve into marketing expert myself. The beginning was fun, but also challenging. We started by sending emails manually to email lists of about 5,000 contacts. Then, we spent nights in a graphics editor, turning open and click rate metrics into informative reports. By morning, our first clients received all the information on all the key metrics they wanted to see. That’s why we like nobody understand the value of marketing automation :) Since that time, we’ve been developing eSputnik to provide solutions to the real challenges our clients face every day, such as: to save time on creating and sending automated marketing messages without having to involve the IT team,to engage with customers through targeted multi-channel marketing,to inform marketing decisions with actionable automated dashboards.

Many Greenlandic families send their children to Denmark for a year at a boarding school (a so-called “efterskole”, literally after school, where you can finish the last 1–3 years of elementary school) to prepare them for high school , which is almost solely in Danish whereas the elementary school is in Greenlandic. Since these schools are cheapest in Western Jutland a lot of young Greenlanders from outside Nuuk have spent a year in Western Jutland (and to a lesser degree other places in Jutland) and that has often slightly influenced their accent. At least in Northern Greenland most of the local Danes are also from Jutland, which then reinforces the vaguely Jutlandic pronunciation some of the local Greenlanders use. In a town like Aasiaat in the Disko Bay region the typical Jutlandic word “træls” (literally slave’s and used to designate all things tiresome, bad and annoying) is used by some Greenlanders. Because Danes practically only use one greeting, “godmorgen” (good morning), some Greenlanders say “godmorgen” at all times of the day. Although the only person I have ever heard say “godaften” (good evening) to me was a 17 year old Greeenlandic girl, no Dane has ever used that greeting with me and it sounded quaint coming from a teenager."},{"prompt":"f you could go back and change one event in history, what would it be?","completion":"i would tell the small man with a silly mustace that hes a good painter."},{"prompt":"Should we use “audience was/were” clapping?","completion":"If we are speaking English, the correct sentence is “the (don’t forget the definite article) was clapping.” Audience is a singular collective noun much as fleet is a singular collective noun for a group of ships.

In the incarnations of Lord Vishnu, there is no classification like complete incarnation, incomplete incarnation, full incarnation, half incarnation, quarter incarnation (or) double & triple incarnation etc. Lord ParashuRama is mentioned in the ten incarnations (Dasavataras) of Lord Vishnu same as Lord SriRama. So incarnation is an incarnation. That’s it. Here we go about the asked question. There is a dispute among the different versions of Ramayana, written by several and different poets (every poet claims that it’s there in Valmiki Ramayana. Analysis differs among the various versions of those Ramayana Books. I am mentioning here two of those analysis regarding the meeting between ParashuRama & SriRama. Analysis-1: Lord ParashuRama has never met SriRama infact (even during the Shiva Bow Event). This is an intentionally included event saying that Lord ParashuRama came there, met SriRama and bla bla bla etc. The meeting of Lord ParashuRama & SriRama is included intentionally by the haters of Lord ParashuRama just to make a showoff. (To show that as if SriRama is greater than Lord ParashuRama). So, it’s a fake to say that Lord ParashuRama met SriRama & SriRama got the upper hand over Lord ParashuRama. Analysis-2: Lord ParashuRama knows that SriRama is another incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Since the Bow of Lord Shiva was broken during the even of Sita Svayamvar when SriRama tried to use the ShivaBow, now the worry of Lord ParashuRama is that it could create a new war between the devotees of Lord Shiva (Shaivas) & the devotees of Lord Vishnu (Vaishnavas). It would create such war because the Vaishnavas may feel proud of SriRama (because the Shiva Bow broken in his hands, SriRama is not only an incarnation of Lord Vishnu, but SriRama, as a human being, he is a great devotee of Lord Vishnu [Vaishnava] also). And that could irritate the devotees of Lord Shiva (Shaivas). So, to come out from this worry, Lord ParashuRama decided to take the bow of Lord Vishnu also with him and meet SriRama. And Lord ParashuRama met SreeRama, intentionally irritated him and challenged to lift & try to use the Vishnu Bow also. And since SriRama is very younger to Lord ParashuRama, and the experience of experienced Lord ParashuRama worked out, SreeRama got irritated, took the Vishnu Bow, lifted and tried to use it just like he tried with Shiva Bow before. And the Vishnu Bow is also broken since it’s also a very old one just like Shiva Bow. And the mission of Lord ParashuRama is successfully completed. So, now the both bows of Lord Shiva & Lord Vishnu are broken in the hand of the same person (Lord SreeRama), there is nil possibility of any war to take place (between Vaishnavas & Shaivas). And no one can blame Lord SreeRama that he has any partiality between Shaivism & Vaishnavisim because he has broken both bows as mentioned above. Hope I have clarified the question."},{"prompt":"w do you feel knowing I have your IP address?","completion":"IP addresses do not link to specific individuals or their places of residence.

Who's fault, selector, captain, or coach?","completion":"Before the world cup started, all of us had very low hopes from the Indian cricket team, especially after the injury of Bumrah. It is a collective fault of all, but the biggest fault of selectors. The entire tournament, they did not change much in the Indian squad. We came so far in the tournament just because of three players - Virat Kohli, Suryakumar Yadav, and Hardik Pandya. The captaincy was weak and predictable, our batting order was not in form, and our bowling was pathetic throughout the tournament.

Sir Dravid's debut test match inings should be the first scene where he scores a 95 and took and missed out an opportunity to score 100 at lords like another debutant. He misses out an opportunity to get his name itched on lords honour board..The story resumes India visits England in 2007 and win the series under his leadership with no proper batsman getting 100. The wait for ‘The Wall' continues. The penultimate scene should say the Legend finally gets a 100 and that his team needed it the most then, makes it all more special. The ultimate scene shall be experts sitting and discussing the day's play where people say how Rahul Dravid has missed to get his name on the board to what Harsha(most fittingly) will reply: “More than the Rahul Dravid i think, there were people like us and the Honour's board itself which wanted Rahul's name on it. This is his moment of glory, but as long as i know him he will give credit to his coach or even to the guy who ran that couple with him to get his 100.

But be prepared to tell them that over and over. Because they can't remember what you tell them. If one-day they come up to you and say they are somewhere totally different than where you've been telling them, just agree with them. They aren't going to remember it. Not in 5 mins or 5 hours. I worked at a residential care facility and none of the residents knew where they were and everyday the same lady would come up to me in the dining room and tell me she was new and could I show her where to sit. That went on everyday for a couple years. Another lady would always come up to me and say excuse me, I'm not winning anything can you help me get off this boat? (We were surrounded by land). Sometimes one of them would ask if she was at home? If I said yes that she was she'd be content with my answer. If I told her no we had to make a stop but we'll be home soon she was ok with that too. . And they'll ask again. If you told that person that they are now living in a nursing home, they might say oh no, and they'll forget a bout it. If they are upset I always tried to say something funny. That would change their mood and we'd been on to something more pleasent because they'd forget they were upset. For example, whenever a new resident moved in an was feeling upset because they new they weren't at home but didn't know where they were, I would tell them to click their heels together 3 times and say there's no place like home ,3 times. They'd do it and when they'd open their eyes and see me still standing there , I'd say SUPRISE! And they'd laugh about it and be in a good mood because I changed their mood from upset to happy. That's how you have to work with them. Every month when the doctor would come to see the residents I had a hard time getting them to go to her office. They don't like Drs. The Dr was a tall lady with black hair down her back. She was from India . Very beautiful. So finally every month I'd go around and ask who wanted to go with me to see the Indian princess. And every month everybody would go with me to where the Dr was and see the Indian princess Just don't argue with them if they think they're somewhere else. Change the subject."},{"prompt":"w do I get someone's name by their mobile number?","completion":"The rejection of traditional forms and structures for poetry that began in the first half of the 20th century coincided with a questioning of the purpose and meaning of traditional definitions of poetry and of distinctions between poetry and prose, particularly given examples of poetic prose and prosaic poetry. Numerous modernist poets have written in non-traditional forms or in what traditionally would have been considered prose, although their writing was generally infused with poetic diction and often with rhythm and tone established by non-metrical means. While there was a substantial formalist reaction within the modernist schools to the breakdown of structure, this reaction focused as much on the development of new formal structures and syntheses as on the revival of older forms and structures"},{"prompt":"a black Little Mermaid, an original Danish fairy tale, cultural appropriation?","completion":"First off, mermaids are fictional.

However, the idea is MUCH older. There are paleolithic cave paintings of mermaids. Third, while the specific story “The Little Mermaid” was written by a Danish guy, that does not mean that all the creatures and people in it are Danes, even by default. Fourth, actors act.

Islam have different warrior races of Arab, turks, Mongols, afghans, Africans and their intermixed. They all are different races and looks differently. A single race was fighting with combined races of Arab, turk, mongol, afghan, African and their intermixed. That is why, rajput call themselves singh. As we are fighting with huge number. This is a greatest achievement in the world. It shows the true martial spirit of rajputs. Rajputs fight with britishers also. In 1857, only kunwar singh died victorious. Others, be it nana sahab, tatya type, laxmibai, all died defeated. It is one of the decorated achievements. We were able to defeat the English soldiers. The English historians themselves wrote praise about kunwar singh. English commanders also praised the fighting spirit of rajputs. In anglo-french war, in the melee(guttham-guttha) between French and rajput soldiers, rajput killed 10 times more French and also captured the French commanders. Melee is known as highest order of battle. It is direct fight."},{"prompt":"What food is just impossible to eat in a civilized manner?","completion":"Wings. Good old greasy, covered with sauce, hotter than blazes chicken wings. ** This guy is surrendering to the wing gods. The only way to eat wings is to pick them up with your dirty, heathen fingers and eat the meat directly from the bone. If you get a little cartilage in there, that’s fine. It’ll be good for your joints or something. I almost forgot about the blue cheese. If you’re like me, you’re going to coat your fire wings with the stuff before you eat them. You’ll also get some stuck in your goatee, and it will be a pain to get out. As far as your fingers go, it’s a combination of licking the sauce off and wiping your hand with a paper towel. Neither method will work by itself. I don’t know how you could eat wings in a “civilized” manner. With a knife and fork? No way, you’d be laughed out of your own dining room. And while I’m pontificating about wings, celery has no business being served on the same plate. That ruins everything. Why did they ever start doing that.

He uses it to produce an army of Commando Droids that are unquestionably loyal to him, and to locate and eliminate an Imperial rival named Doctor Cylo. Vader travelled to Geonosis after he got word that a surviving Geonosian Queen had a droid factory on the Imperial sterilised planet of Geonosis. A Geonosian named Klik Klak had kept her safe all these years. She was named after Queen Karina the great; one of Geonosis’ first queens. Vader used force and took her factory, then used it to produce a small army of BX-Series Droid Commandos to help him in his task of eliminating Dr Cylo. Although Palpatine ordered Vader to give the shutdown command to all the Battle Droids of the Separatist Alliance, small pockets of droids resisted the order to shutdown, and continued to operate not realising that the war was over,.. and the newly formed Galactic Empire had replaced the Republic. The Empire hunted and eliminated most of these droid pockets during its formative years. Droids such as Kalani, a Super Tactical Droid, resisted the shutdown command believing it to be a Republic trick. He and his army of B1 Battle Droids, and Droidekas, remained in the collapsed hulk of an old Separatist DH-Omni Support Vessel on the planet of Agamar. Kalani overrode Vaders signal during the shutdown order, and on Agamar they remained until members of the Rebel cell Phoenix Squadron came and let Kalani and his droid forces know that the Clone Wars was over; but not before he put up a valiant final effort in events that seen the Empire intervene, and swiftly cease hostilities between the Rebels and the Droid Army."},{"prompt":"What company offers good mobile application development services?","completion":"There are several companies that offer excellent mobile application development services.

I had to manually shut it off.","completion":"Your two most likely cases based on what is written, is: Siphoning, or slow fill. Additional clarification would be appreciated. First thing to check is if your drain hose is too far down the drain stem. 6\\" is about standard. The other factor is: WHERE is the drain? If the drain is on the floor, you need to make sure your drain hose is elevated above functioning water line, else it will simply….siphon out. As for long fill: Whirlpool has this trick, not sure how many others do… if there is not enough water registered by a certain period of time, it will assume it is flooding, and drain out. Check the screen ON THE WASHER, behind the hose, on the cold water side. Typically that one gets backed up, causing this issue."},{"prompt":"w do you know that you have found a true friend?","completion":"They would never try to hurt you intentionally.

Here are a few possible paths they can consider: 1️⃣ Internships: Engaging in internships or co-op programs can provide valuable hands-on experience and help bridge the gap between graduation and securing a full-time position. This can also help graduates build important industry connections. 2️⃣ Continuing Education: Pursuing further education, such as a master's degree or specialized certifications, can enhance a civil engineer's skill set and make them more marketable to potential employers. 3️⃣ Networking: Actively participating in industry events, joining professional organizations, and utilizing online platforms can help civil engineers expand their professional network. Networking can lead to job opportunities and valuable industry connections. 4️⃣ Freelancing or Consulting: Offering services as a freelance civil engineer or consultant can provide valuable work experience and income while searching for permanent employment. This option allows engineers to showcase their skills and build a portfolio of work. 5️⃣ Volunteering: Donating time and skills to nonprofit organizations, community projects, or charitable causes can provide civil engineers with practical experience, allow them to give back to the community, and demonstrate their commitment to the profession.

In most Western airports, no one checks and technically you could walk out with any suitcase you want - unless stopped by the rightful owner. Generally, people are honest enough to collect their own baggage only. There’s always the risk of picking up someone else’s case and being pulled for a customs check, which could go horribly wrong. The airports tend to prefer to keep people moving as quickly as possible and leave it to the individual to pick up the correct cases. Time (and a crowd of people) is money, as they say. The preference is the deterrent of security cameras and the risk of being held liable for someone else’s contents, should you be stopped. In other parts of the world, India for example, that little sticky label the check in staff put on the back of your passport or boarding card, becomes hugely important. That’s your luggage receipt and you will not be allowed to leave the airport without it matching the cases collected. After collecting your baggage, there’s an exit inspection of the receipt and it’s matched to the label on the bag. I have witnessed someone being pulled aside for taking the wrong case. They definitely take it seriously."},{"prompt":"w do you know that you have found a true friend?","completion":"A true friend will always be there with you through tragedy, sorrow, good times, bad times, times of celebration, and will always love you and accept you for who you are, not for who they want you to be I know this from experience.

Rapid weight loss may not be sustainable in the long run and can have adverse health effects. Aim for a gradual and steady weight loss of 1-2 pounds per week for safe and lasting results. 2. Focus on Nutrition Eating a balanced and nutrient-rich diet is paramount to quick and healthy weight loss. Opt for whole foods such as lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats. Cut back on processed foods, sugary snacks, and high-calorie beverages. Pay attention to portion sizes to avoid overeating. 3. Stay Hydrated Drinking an adequate amount of water throughout the day not only supports overall health but also aids in weight loss. Water helps control appetite, boosts metabolism, and can prevent overeating. Aim to drink at least 8 glasses of water daily. 4. Incorporate Physical Activity Engaging in regular physical activity is essential for burning calories and accelerating weight loss. Aim for a combination of cardiovascular exercises (such as walking, jogging, or cycling) and strength training (using weights or resistance bands) to build muscle and boost metabolism. 5. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) Consider incorporating HIIT workouts into your fitness routine. HIIT involves alternating between high-intensity exercises and short rest periods. This approach is effective in burning calories, increasing metabolic rate, and improving cardiovascular fitness. 6. Get Adequate Sleep Prioritize quality sleep, as inadequate sleep can hinder weight loss efforts. Poor sleep disrupts hormones that regulate appetite, leading to increased cravings and overeating. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night."},{"prompt":"Would Hillary Clinton have made a better President than Donald J Trump?","completion":"I have rocks in my garden that would make a better president than Trump."},{"prompt":"Sometimes when I'm on a WhatsApp call, the app suddenly says call on hold.

They had 11″ guns, and would have had a hard time wearing down Ramillies. Barring outragous luck, I can’t see any way of sinking Ramilles that doesn’t also sink one of the ugly sisters. Now, remember; Germany had two heavy battleships- Tirpitz and Bismark, two lighter ones, Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, and some heavy cruisers- the Deutchland and Admiral hipper classes. The British had far more battleships and battlecruisers. If you trade ships on a 1:1 basis, like Hood and Bismark, the side who starts with fewer runs out. Keeping S&G functioning, and they’re a threat to many convoys, so require lots of effort to cover against. Order them to engage, and play it out. Ramilles fights, and the convoy scatters, and probably gets mauled by Uboats. Scharnhorst is crippled, unable to do above three knots, and come nightfall gets torpedeod by a destroyer. Gneisenau takes heavy hits forward, wrecking a fore turret, and requiring the forward magazine to be flooded to prevent the fire causing and explosion. It breaks off and heads for France Ramilles is heavily battered, but still floating. She may make port,or may get finished off by a Uboat. If she makes port, the damage is probably so severe she gets placed in reserve, and her crew end up on 10 new destroyers. Net result? The germans see two ships sunk or out of action for a year, the British one."},{"prompt":"there anything about the Kobe Bryant helicopter crash that just doesn’t add up?","completion":"Pending investigation, the case is still unexplainable at best. As always, things that just don't add up are typically “witnesses' reports”.

Heck, newer more silent engines can also sound like sputter too in certain environmental condition and background noise. I think that's all.

The pilot, Ara Zobayan self-reported the procedural mishaps himself. This reinforces the belief about the pilot's reputation for being professional and safety-minded.

I mean that's natural, but be mindful about is consequences, especially if you are public official or politicians. We must wait for the investigation to be completed by the professionals, even if it meant waiting for years. The number one priority is as always not answering our curiosity or personal questions, but preventing the same accident from happening again. Thus getting the correct answer is very important here. There are other non-technical, NBA-gossipy aspects to this accident, that it happened not long after LeBron James surpassed Kobe Bryant in all-time NBA scoring record. I guess that is just a sheer coincidence, most likely nothing to do with the accident.

You won’t have to compete with PhD students for attention, so if you want to work on research, it’s relatively easy. It’s a popular recruiting site for SV companies large and small, because the programs are high quality, because it’s local, and because it’s a Hispanic-serving institution (HSI). Does it compare with Stanford and UC Berkeley? Yes and no. Each of these schools has strengths and weaknesses. The experiences will be quite different, but the end results will not be for 9 out of 10 students. If you are an exceptional programmer, you will not find yourself limited having gone to SJSU, and if your goal is a PhD, you will be able to grow and be a viable candidate per your ability. You really have to consider in which environment you might thrive. Many people assume that all UC students are better than all CSU students, and that no student would ever turn down a UC for a CSU. Neither is true. Increasingly, the UCs are unable to offer the kind of educational experience that many students want. In addition, a competitive California student can choose a CSU and be confident of admission, even to an impacted program.

There are a lot factors we will to, when we buy mattresses. Like quality of mattress, size dimensions, fabric or material of mattress. And we can go for a lot but below I’ve mentioned the major factors so you should look at those and decide if you should buy what you are getting in exchange of your money What Matters the Most? Below are some of the key factors to acknowledge when you are wondering about how to buy a mattress. Support→ The mattress should be sturdy enough to handle all types of body weights. Also, make sure that it can easily accommodate additional layers of blankets and comforters with no effect over its comfort. For this, you can look forward to various thickness options of 4\\" inch, 5\\" inch, 6\\" inch, 8\\" inch and many others. Temperature→ The mattress should instill the body temperature and stay apt with it. So, look for those having gel-infused layer that is cool to the body. This initiates you to pick a mattress that can adapt as per the body temperature. Breathing Accessibility→ A mattress type also varies with the appropriate use of material to regulate the ventilation and comfort factor. So look over mattresses that have well-structured cotton layer. Organic cotton layer over a mattress enhance its ability to breathe, thus eliminating the presence of allergies. Pressure Relief Point→ While checking for a mattress, look for those which have transition layer right above. This layer is for providing lumbar support ensuring an aligned spine and healthy sleep every night. Posture Adaptability→ Opt for mattresses that have a layer dedicated to posture adaptability. This makes it easy to take a nap loaded with snug and vanishes the pressure on the body. Where to Shop for a Mattress?

Doing so would easily end your CIA/Airforce flying career. We ll during the delivery of some SR’s to a museum, a record attempt was to be made. As such the Air Inlet Temp maximums were raised from 427º to 450ºC for this flight. Conditions did not allow any top speeds to be broken. There are pics of the actual printout from the jet following that attempted top speed ass. These jets were always flying as fast as they could, within operational limits. Many stories of pilots making turns and esp. speeding up to avoid missiles should be taken with a grain of salt. You couldn’t just pin the throttle and attain top speeds, weights winds and temps all came into play. Once at top altitudes, which is planned to occur over your target area, there isnt much (if any) throttle left to stuff in. These jets are always in afterburner, and even when the SR71 was refueling, the longer SR71 jet holding more fuel(compared to A-12) required minimum afterburner, in ONE engine, to allow it to keep up with the tanker as it’s fuel load approached full (80,000 pounds, the higher flying/slightly faster A-12 only carried 68,000 pounds of fuel). The problem with the Foxbat was that its engines were NOT designed to cruise at Mach 3 speeds, the A-12/SR-71/M-21/YF-12A were. Once off the tanker, the blackbirds are constantly accelerating and climbing to attain max altitudes over the target area, once through the target area, they are slowing/descending looking for a tanker.

If these had existed when I was in industry, that would probably not be sufficient as the only credential, but to advance/continue a career, it would be a good thing. If you didn’t have prior work experience, a college degree, or another form of experience (e.g., extensive contributions to open-source projects, a strong personal portfolio, etc.), I don’t think it would have been sufficient.

In fact, it is the very reason why I prefer minority governments as it forces such cooperation. Liberal cooperation and support from the NDP in exchange for certain NDP policy planks being advanced is how some of the greatest things in this country have come about, such as universal healthcare. The Liberals and the NDP agree on a whole lot of things. Often times it’s only a matter of to what degree they wish to go. Being willing to compromise and work together towards advancing those goals is a wonderful development and one that should happen more often. Given that the majority of Canadians voted for these two parties, along with the Bloc who, despite their whole anti-federalist Quebec Sovereignty thing, generally agree with the Liberals on most other things, it sounds like we might actually be getting a government that can accomplish things that most Canadians want, and without there having to be another pointless election a year after the last one to confirm it.

But while talking about this novel, this novel is crime,drama, thriller and a story that tells you nobody is perfect. I have read the novel THE GIRL IN ROOM 105 . I think this is one of the best book ever written by chetan bhagat. I don't want to spoil the book for you but any way, I will do it. The protagonist of the story is keshav . Keshav had completed his IIT a few years back and had been working in Chandan classes. He doesn't like his job. He lived in a small flat with his freind saurabh . They both were working in the same institution. Keshav was in a relationship with Zara lone . Zara was from srinagar, kashmir. They had there break up 5 years ago but keshav was still into her. He liked her. He called zara on every new year and on her birthday thinking she will come back in a relationship with him .But zara refused to talk because she was in a relationship with Raghu .Zara didn't want to talk to keshav and was not willing to reply. But there was a big turn in the story. Zara messaged Keshav on her birthday at midnight and asked keshav to come to her room. Room 105. When keshav arrived by climbing the mango tree near her window and found Zara’s dead body. Here, Keshav adventure begins. Step by step keshav reveals and realised about Zara's past . Her father,mother and her brother relations with the terriorts of kashmir. While searching for Zara's murderer he met Faiz. Faiz was a reputed military officer posted in kashmir. As keshav breaks the case a little more he found gold biscuits in Faiz's house. The end of the story brings twist in the story. As the murderer posed in the previous chapter comes up to be a different person. The story changes the traits and ideas of both keshav as well as the reader about the true meaning of love. It tells that every one is a human,everyone makes mistakes and no body is perfect. It also shows that a trust worthy person can also be a devil under disguised. This is first story written by chetan bhagat which does not primarily focus on the concept of love as it focuses on the truth of life and the truth of human beings . I would definitely advise you to read this book. The story is good and it's nicely written. I can assure you that reading this book is not a waste ,you will be entertained and thrilled. At last I think you will like my thoughts on the book, THE GIRL IN ROOM 105 and as always thanks for reading.!"},{"prompt":"Does Walmart sell prime ribs?","completion":"No"},{"prompt":"f you tell a taxi or Uber driver to just drive, where will they go?","completion":"Taxi, I have no idea, but with Uber you have to set your destination as part of the vehicle request , so he will take you to that destination."},{"prompt":"Can an unmarried couple stay in Coimbatore?","completion":"Coimbatore is declared as the safest city in the year 2017 .

San Francisco has, in my experience far more casual littering than other cities I’ve visited or lived in. We are currently in a situation where there are eight to ten thousand “homeless” people on our streets, a large chunk who to be perfectly blunt are not capable of caring for themselves and their own hygiene due to mental and drug problems. They root through trash cans looking for food or discarded items that they may be able to use, often just discarding the things that they don’t want directly on the streets. Many push shopping trolleys filled to the top with junk. The junk spills out and blows around. They also live in tent encampments surrounded by trash, and they move around, leaving the rubbish behind. In short, we have a societal problem here that makes our streets filthy. I don’t think that they have such a problem in Vancouver, or indeed, many other places. Another issue is, due to budget (and other?) issues, a whole lot of trash cans have just disappeared. SF is committed to “zero landfill” in the coming years, and part of that is to reduce the ability of people to just “throw trash ‘away’.” Well, that’s great if you’re at home and can sort recycle, compost, and rubbish. But if there are few to no trash cans on the sidewalk, many are, honestly, just either overfilling the existing ones or stuffing the trash in places where it just does not belong (go by any bus stop and see how many cups, newspapers, stuffed into the gaps between the plastic seats). We need more public bins. But generally (and I mean no offence to Americans - I am happy to be an American), my observation is that Canadians are just more…tidy? than Americans are? Canadians take a much more generous view of “the commons” - those public assets that we all share. And thus, they are just generally more conscientious about taking care to keep things that others share more clean and to leave a smaller footprint."},{"prompt":"found a red room on the deep web, how can I report it without getting myself in trouble?","completion":"First of all, there are very explicit and better quality gore videos on the surface web that load much faster.

Facial Exercises: Perform facial exercises such as cheek lifts, jaw movements, and chin lifts to tone and strengthen the facial muscles. 3.

Healthy Diet: Consume a nutritious diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains while minimizing processed foods and sugary beverages. 5.

Cardiovascular Exercise: Engage in cardiovascular activities like running, swimming, or cycling to burn calories and promote overall weight loss. 7. Limit Alcohol Consumption: Alcohol can lead to dehydration and facial bloating, so it's best to moderate or avoid alcohol intake. 8. Get Sufficient Sleep: Aim for quality sleep as inadequate sleep can contribute to fluid retention and puffiness in the face. 9. Facial Massage: Regularly massaging the face can help improve blood circulation and promote lymphatic drainage, reducing facial puffiness. 10.

Fires like to consume fuel and when conditions are right, they eat voraciously. The factors that influence fire spread are: the type of fuelthe moisture level of the fuel and prevailing humiditywind speed/directionterrain (slope) Some fuels burn faster than others, just like kindling versus logs. So thin grasses/shrubs will go faster than trees. The moisture in the air and the fuel also plays a big factor. The longer things have to dry out, the faster they will ignite. As far as humidity, according to the National Park Service “Light fuels, such as grass and pine needles, gain and lose moisture quickly with changes in relative humidity. When the RH drops, fire behavior increases because these fine fuels become drier. Heavy fuels, on the other hand, respond to humidity changes more slowly.” [LINKED_TEXT: Understanding Fire Danger (U.S. National Park Service)Since 1974, five rating levels have been used to describe danger levels in public information releases and fire prevention signing: Low (Green) —Fire starts are unlikely. Weather and fuel conditions will lead to slow fire spread, low intensity, and relatively easy control with light mop up. Controlled burns can usually be executed with reasonable safety. Moderate (Blue) —Some wildfires may be expected. Expect moderate flame length and rate of spread. Control is usually not difficult and light to moderate mop up can be expected. Although controlled burning can be done without creating a hazard, routine caution should be taken. High (Yellow) —Wildfires are likely. Fires in heavy, continuous fuel, such as mature grassland, weed fields, and forest litter, will be difficult to control under windy conditions. Control through direct attack may be difficult but possible, and mop up will be required. Outdoor burning should be restricted to early morning and late evening hours. Very High (Orange) —Fires start easily from all causes and may spread faster than suppression resources can travel. Flame lengths will be long with high intensity, making control very difficult. Both suppression and mop up will require an extended and very thorough effort. Outdoor burning is not recommended. Extreme (Red) —Fires will start and spread rapidly. Every fire start has the potential to become large. Expect extreme, erratic fire behavior. NO OUTDOOR BURNING SHOULD TAKE PLACE IN AREAS WITH EXTREME FIRE DANGER. Relative Humidity Relative humidity (RH) is the ratio of the amount of moisture in the air to the amount of moisture necessary to saturate the air at the same temperature and pressure. Relative humidity is expressed in percent. RH is measured directly by automated weather stations or manually by wet and dry bulb readings taken with a psychrometer and applying the National Weather Service psychrometric tables applicable to the elevations where the reading were taken. Relative humidity is important because dead forest fuels and the air are always exchanging moisture. Low humidity takes moisture from the fuels, and fuels in turn, take moisture from the air when the humidity is high. Light fuels, such as grass and pine needles, gain and lose moisture quickly with changes in relative humidity. When the RH drops, fire behavior increases because these fine fuels become drier. Heavy fuels, on the other hand, respond to humidity changes more slowly. To see significant changes in heavy fuel moisture, there must be significant moisture, usually from more than a single storm. Fuel Moisture Fuel moisture is measured for live herbaceous (annual and perennial) and woody (shrubs, branches, and foliage) fuels and dry (dead) fuels. These are calculated values representing approximate moisture content of the fuel . Fuel moisture in live fuels varies through the growing season and between different climate classes. There are 20 different fuel models, representing the variety of vegetatiohttps://www.nps.gov/articles/understanding-fire-danger.htm#:~:text=Light%20fuels%2C%20such%20as%20grass,to%20humidity%20changes%20more%20slowly.] [URL: https://www.nps.gov/articles/understanding-fire-danger.htm#%3A~%3Atext%3DLight%20fuels%2C%20such%20as%20grass%2Cto%20humidity%20changes%20more%20slowly.]Wind will obviously drive the fire along faster. That was the issue with a recent New Mexico prescribed burn. The conditions were right, but after the burn started the winds picked up and now it has consumed 260,000 acres since April 6th. Finally, fire moves at a steady pace on it’s own, but if it is on an “upslope”, the rising heat will dry out and prewarm the fuel ahead of it allowing it to gain speed. The opposite is true on a “down slope”. Fires can burn through areas inaccessible to man and machine necessitating, at times, getting well ahead of the fire and allowing it to burn to you. And unlike city streets where you may find a hydrant every 500 feet, in the wilderness your water supply could be miles away and being brought in by air tanker, helicopter, or numerous ground tenders 500–1000 gallons at a time."},{"prompt":"What are the most touristic countries in the world?","completion":"skiing, and outdoor adventures.Petra, Jordan: An archaeological wonder and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Petra is a breathtaking ancient city carved into pink sandstone cliffs, featuring stunning temples, tombs, and amphitheaters.The Great Barrier Reef, Australia: The world's largest coral reef system, the Great Barrier Reef is a kaleidoscope of colors and marine life that's perfect for snorkeling, diving, and sailing.Angkor Wat, Cambodia: A UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most significant archaeological sites in Southeast Asia, Angkor Wat is a sprawling temple complex built in the 12th century, featuring intricate carvings, towers, and bas-reliefs.The Swiss Alps: With their snow-capped peaks, charming villages, and scenic train rides, the Swiss Alps offer some of the most breathtaking views in Europe, as well as skiing, hiking, and mountaineering opportunities.The Grand Canyon, USA: A natural wonder and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Grand Canyon is a massive geological formation carved by the Colorado River over millions of years, featuring stunning rock formations, colorful sunsets, and hiking trails.The Amalfi Coast, Italy: A UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most picturesque and romantic places in Italy, the Amalfi Coast features colorful cliffside villages, dramatic views of the sea, and delicious local cuisine.

I blame this entire experience on myself as I took one of my former friends (who I should have realised would have been a major drama queen throughout this movie) walked out of the freaken theater after the first jump scare. I mean, does anyone actually remember if there were jump scares or not in that movie? Who the fuck cares anyways. It’s the Grudge 2 for crying out loud! The English adaptation at that. Also my mistake for thinking that she and I could just enjoy a movie without her having to make a big deal when the first time the long haired creep chick made her first appearance. So most of you would think that I followed her out of the theater and asked her what was wrong as I let her lean on my shoulder and cry, right? Wrong. I let her walk out by herself. Her own mother wasn’t home at the time so she had to wait for my mother to come to the theater, pick us both up and drive us home. Honorable mention: I went to see the very first Iron Man movie with a friend from high school. I felt bad because she didn’t have much money but was hungry and looked like she could use a snack. Also, wouldn’t you think that the person with the money gets to ordeer the snacks in this situation? No, she smiles like a fucking madwoman, runs right up to the counter and orders a LARGE popcorn and a LARGE soda. I wasn’t sure how much money she thought I had, since we were both teenagers at the time. My older self would have gladly to tell her to screw off, but my teenage self stood there with shock and paid for the snacks. I got a small soda for myself. She didn’t offer me any popcorn throughout the movie, but I happily reached over taking massive handfuls for myself throughout the movie. I now go to movies alone. And every movie alone has been a magical experience. I figured why do I need to take someone with me if I am going to be sitting in a dark room for a couple hours and you aren’t supposed to talk throughout the movie anyways? I am going to see Avengers: Endgame tomorrow. And I’ll enjoy a large popcorn and soda all by myself, smiling from ear to ear. Sorry if I came off as an asshole.

The car needs to have been popular, influential, and long-lasting. It also needs to be well-built and fast. The first car on our list is the Ford Model T. This car changed the way people thought about automobiles and had an enormous impact on the industry. It was affordable for most Americans, which was unheard of at the time. It was also very efficient, with a top speed of 45 mph and an average speed of 20 mph. It also had great acceleration and could go from zero to 30 mph in less than two seconds! Another great car from this era is the Bugatti Type 35 Grand Prix Racer. The Type 35 Grand Prix Racer was designed for high speeds on straight roads and had great acceleration downhills due to its lightweight frame design and powerful engine capacity (1 liter). It could reach speeds up to 90 mph! Well, no car's greatness is completed without proper protection.

Next, I would not think about a direct siege. That’s suicide and not the Spartan way. What is the Spartan way? Assault the damn thing, but do it smart. AS a well trained, highly motivated soldier, a Spartan should be a very tough nut to crack in close quarters, so that would be the whole point. For this, I would go for 2 things: Infiltrate some men: perhaps disguised as foreign mercenaries, foreign actors wanting to showcase the lord of the castle with their “Games” and whatnot, get them in and have them be ready to take and open the gates (a good castle would have an exterior gate and an inner fortress) at any cost.Night attack. Longbows or not, hitting men in the dark is not easy. So, night attack it is, with ropes or stairs if possible to get as many men as you can onto the walls, and the rest rushing the (hopefully) open gate. In close quarters and with steel chainmail and swords and shields, the Spartans should overcome the local garrison of men at arms and the few knights around the Lord.

IF I ever try ballroom chacha, it will only be because it’s an acquired taste. I used to think the styling is ridiculous, the music boring and why in hell bother with trying to synchronize perfectly with a partner? I know better now, but it’s still unclear if I’ll ever try ballroom. So, to answer the question, I think ballroom is similar to a scented candle party for the average North American dude.

However, I can provide some general guidelines to help identify news sources that are considered to be relatively objective and unbiased. Here are some tips for evaluating news sources: Check for the source's reputation: Check the reputation of the news source and see if it has a history of factual, unbiased reporting. You can check the source's website and look for their mission statement, editorial policies, and their history.Avoid sensational headlines: Be wary of headlines that use exaggerated or sensational language to grab attention. These headlines are often designed to generate clicks and may not accurately represent the content of the article.Cross-check multiple sources: Verify news stories by consulting multiple sources, including ones that have different perspectives. Compare how different sources present the same story.Avoid opinionated or partisan content: Opinionated content or content that clearly reflects a particular political or ideological bias can be difficult to distinguish from factual news. Look for news sources that focus on reporting facts and events, rather than offering commentary or opinion.

The amount of money you earn is linked to your ability. If not many people can do what you do, you can get a big reward. For other engineers, success is the opportunity to work on exciting and world class projects and be recognised for their contribution. Regardless how you define success, here is what you need to succeed. Passion for the profession is what you need to drive your career. It is the inner force that makes you sail the ups and downs of a career in engineering. It is what keeps you in the office late at night working on projects not because you have to but because you want to. It is what pushes you to study and improve your skills.Technical Knowledge and ability to use it to solve problems. Engineering is the art and science to deal with mother nature so you need sound hard skills and know the engineering theory behind formulas. There is no shortcut but years of study and continue professional development.You need Persistence both as a student and then as an engineer. Be accountable for your failures but never give up on your dreams. Keep trying . Any day past is a step closer to your goal if you persist in your action.You need to have Strategy to get where you want to go and to be who you want to be. Select jobs that are in line with the career path you want to take and choose the company that will give you the opportunity to develop the skills you require to be successful. You select the company and not the other way around.Pick a good Mentor and not a good company. The two hardly coincide. Especially at the beginning of a career, a mentor can teach things that may take years to conquer. A mentor is a senior engineer willing to spend time with you to build your skills. A mentor is someone who enjoys watching you succeed because your success will be his/her. It is very difficult to understand if a company has a real mentor. Generally speaking small companies or small teams in medium-large companies offer the best mentorship opportunities to young engineers.You need to be picky about your Career path. Once your have worked out which niche of the engineering profession you like the most and would like to master, don't lose sight of it. It will come a time when an opportunity knocks at the door wanting you to steer your career path to another direction. It could be an offer from another company or internal to the company you work for. Don’t venture in that territory unless you have a plan B to go back to your previous role. The stakes are higher when you are senior as you have less time to make up a wrong choice.You need to Respect everybody but fear nobody. Eventually, and in different forms, everybody will be bullied in their career. A client, a colleague, a subcontractor will bully you. It is certain. It could come verbally or in writing but it will come and force you to face the pressure. Stay calm, be polite and do what you think is the right thing and not what others tell you. Reputation takes years to gain and seconds to lose. I think that reputation is the best asset for an engineer, take care of it.Always be Professional. What I mean is that your professional judgment is your best alley. Don't agree on changing your position, idea, solution, design if you truly believe in it. Be open to suggestions and accept critiques but defend your point.

Thanks for reaching out with your question. Making money online without any investment is definitely possible in 2023. Let me share with you a few methods that can help you get started. One of the popular ways to make money online without investment is through freelance work. If you have a skill or talent, such as writing, graphic design, programming, or even social media management, you can offer your services on freelancing platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, or Freelancer. Create a profile showcasing your expertise, and start bidding on projects or gigs that match your skills. As you complete more projects and gain positive feedback from clients, you can gradually increase your rates and attract more clients. Another avenue to explore is affiliate marketing. This involves promoting products or services and earning a commission for every sale or lead generated through your referral. You can sign up for affiliate programs offered by various companies or join affiliate networks like Amazon Associates, ClickBank, or CJ Affiliate. Find products or services that align with your interests or niche, create engaging content (such as blog posts, videos, or social media posts) to promote them, and include your unique affiliate links. When someone makes a purchase through your link, you earn a commission. Now, let me share a little story from my own life. A few years ago, I found myself in a similar situation, looking for ways to make money online without any investment. At that time, I had a passion for writing and decided to try my hand at freelance writing. I created an account on a freelancing platform and started bidding on writing projects. It was a slow start, but with persistence and continuous improvement, I began to land more and more projects. As I gained experience and positive feedback, clients started approaching me directly for their writing needs. This allowed me to increase my rates and choose projects that truly interested me. Eventually, I even built a small team of writers and started taking on more significant projects. Freelancing not only helped me make money but also gave me the freedom to work from anywhere and manage my own time. So, my friend, don't underestimate the possibilities that exist in the online world. With determination, effort, and a little creativity, you can definitely make money online without any initial investment.

But all their products were the same as Woolco, Kmart and Walmart — even Zellers with pretty much the same prices. It was opening day and I had hoped some hoopla was in order. Free coffee and treats, free balloons, free discounts. A banner at least saying, Opening Day. But nada, nothing. For all I knew the store had been there for years. This was just the first time I walked into it. And as I said, it had absolutely nothing on the existing five and dime stores (which I know I know aren’t five and dime anymore). Nothing was different enough for me to bother going there again. I did go to another store about a year later and was surprised to see how empty it was, compared to Walmart. And then they left.

Some problems, of course, were created by misguided Congressional oversight and Congress often gets blamed. But in truth, that was arguably only a small part of the problem in the big picture. The idea of a reusable space plane has been a dream of space enthusiasts since before there was a space program. This idea was pitched to Congress and the administration as a way to dramatically lower costs, to make accessing space more reliable and safer. The reality is that nobody had any real idea how to make a real space plane. It was something that sounded nice but was technologically beyond anybody's capability at the time. So NASA contorted itself in reality though space shuttle system was far more expensive and far more impractical than conventional rockets. It was also far more complex to maintain making it reliability and safety highly problematic. Unfortunately, the situation became even worse than that. Though developing the initial fleet of space shuttles had been insanely expensive, Congress had been promised that the costs of maintaining the fleet would be relatively low. In fact, the costs were incredibly high. As a result, there was virtually no money for replacing old shuttles as they aged or for investigating new, better designs for space vehicles. So the space shuttles we're costing the government of fortune and were gradually aging and decaying. And as their reliability continued to get worse, public enthusiasm for manned space travel eroded as well, only hurting NASA even more. Sadly, the US space program could be much further along today if the whole space plane idea had been killed early on. This is not to say that someday space planes may not become a reality, but certainly in the 1970s there was no realistic way a space plane could be built. The technology simply wasn't there."},{"prompt":"What is the best way to prepare for AWS Certified Developer (Associate) in 2017?","completion":"I would say that keeping content up to date is a common factor with all course providers (cloud guru included - who ‘full disclosure’ im a content creator for).

These are the finalists and I choose FO'22 as the BEST. (It is very hard to choose one. All were really great.) Image below: Nadal and his 22nd major trophy FO'22. After his absence by the 2021 injury, Nadal came back and won AO'22 which was AMAZING. After that, Nadal had another ATP title, injury (rib stress fracture), and absence by this new injury. Then, the clay court season started and Nadal came back. He didn't do well and he was even LIMPING during a match. That was by his foot problem. That was how he left. So, when Nadal came back and started at FO'22, no one knew about Nadal's condition and about how well he was going to do there! Until Nadal won the FO, no one knew the secret. What a brilliant solution! Nadal’s painful foot was numbed by multiple injections throughout the French Open. So, he kept going and lifted the trophy which was Nadal's 14th FO and 22nd major. The bestest of the bests. For me the highlight was Nadal's quarter final match against Djokovic. (At the 2021 FO, Nadal was beaten by Djokovic in the semifinal. Nadal's foot problem returned there and the rest of the year was a nightmare.) Beating Djokovic in the quarterfinal is THE BEST VICTORY. I include images from the other four great victories here. Nadal and his father at Nadal's AO'22 victory. Nadal was 21 there. First men's singles player to reach 21. “For Nadal's father, his son is always a little boy who amazes everyone by his extraordinary talent.” The image below is FO'20. Nadal was 20, and joined Federer who won 20 first. During Nadal's consecutive 18 French Opens, he celebrated his birthday AND a title at 13 French Opens. Another FO title came at a French Open where Nadal didn't have his birthday. This was the one. Due to Covid-19 pandemic, FO'20 was held in Sep/Oct of that year instead of May/June. AO'09. (Nadal's victory) Federer's loss made Federer cry. Wimbledon'08. Before 2008, Federer had 5 consecutive wins here."},{"prompt":"What is the difference in academic rigor between Harvard, MIT, Stanford, etc. and the top European schools like Oxford, Cambridge, ETH (Zurich Federal Institute of Technology), etc.?","completion":"The main difference I have seen between American and European universities is the way they treat their students. American colleges treat you like you just came out of high school because you did. European universities in to treat you like adults, because you tend to be. In the US, parents will be the child’s tuition- Students usually are not even with legal drinking age until they’re seniors. In Europe, it is assumed that you are paying your own way, and therefore tuition is cheaper, but So is micromanagement. In most European universities, attendance is not mandatory, professors do not need to stop their lectures to answer your questions, and there’s a lot more students than you realize because most of them don’t go to class and just show up for finals because They can. For someone used to constant feedback from their mentors, European universities make you feel like you are a number that nobody cares about. For someone that values independence, American colleges may feel stifling and a repeat from high school, which you had tried to run away from for years. If I had an offer in America and Europe from equally prestigious schools, I would choose the one that fit my lifestyle more or the one that made me pay less."},{"prompt":"am the owner of an adult website called https://matureanallovers.com.

The argument that Pro-Life libertarianism in an oxymoron misrepresents Libertarianism as meaning “fiscally conservative but Socially liberal”. In fact that’s not what it is. Libertarianism is a political ideology that posits that every law is by its very nature an infringement upon freedom of the individual and as such the government should not issue any laws except inasmuch as legislation is essential to the prevention of harm. That harm prevention bit is known as the Non-Aggression Principle. If a fetus is a human life then the Non Aggression Principle not only allows but requires legislation against abortion. And if a fetus isn’t a human life then Libertarianism would condemn any and all legislation against abortion as an infringement upon bodily autonomy. The dispute between Pro-Life Libertarians and Pro-Choice Libertarians is that the former believe that a fetus is a human life and as such consider abortion worthy of criminalization according to the dictates of the Non Aggression Principle whereas Pro-Choice Libertarians disagree with the assertion that the fetus is a human life and as such don’t believe that the Non Aggression Principle applies in this case.

In case (b) they *have* to see the doctor in order to get the certification they need. It’s up to the doctor to make a decision on the merits and the context.

The American Astronomical Society. We present stellar evolution calculations for the lowest mass stars, i.e., those stars with masses in the range 0.08 M_☉ ≤ M_* ≤ 0.25 M_☉. We find that stars with masses M < 0.20 M_☉ will never evolve through a red giant stage. After becoming gradually brighter and bluer for trillions of years, these late M dwarfs of today will develop radiative-conductive cores and mild nuclear shell sources; these stars then end their lives as helium white dwarfs.

What would Japan government do in response?","completion":"It’s rather sad. Population collapsing, deflation, challenges moving to consumer based economy and overstock of infrastructure… CCP knows very well where it stands. It’s at the end of the runway. We know, we have been there. China needs help, but it knows not how to ask. Hence he blurted out a very poorly engineered and schizophrenic attempt at… not quite a request for assistance, but more like call for solidarity? We can only guess the stress he must be under, poor fellow. It is also a treasure trove of insight. Notably, he seems to believe ethnicity still plays a role in today’s political ideology. It does, but one need not look beyond Rishi Sunak and Barack Obama to realize relation between class and race is on the way to being decoupled. And curiously, CCP seems to believe Japanese and Koreans are of the same ethnic stock as Chinese? Like the Aryan race pseudoscience, that is not only nonsensical, but also dangerous. Maybe there is a bit of subconscious sense of inferiority and insecurity going on that compels them to tie everything back to ethnicity when forced into the defensive? Also, it betrays how badly CCP is stuck in WW2. “Asia for Asians” was *our* line back in the day. Hakko Ichiu and all that. While Japan was rampaging across their country nominally in the name of the welfare of greater Asia, China was badly owned and raped by not only Japan but most of the world, KMT was carrying out all the fighting that mattered, and CCP was literally a bunch of hill bandits radicalized by a political doctrine thought up by a German person. It is entirely understandable that they must have been seething in resentment for decades, “we should have been in the place of Japanese Empire, and we would have done it so much better.” In the end, what CCP wants is a rematch, in its own image. But sadly, the world moved on. It is saddled with new problems requiring non racial axis of cooperation to solve. Like global warming and global depopulation. As tragic as the circumstances may have been, resolving emotional baggage of the CCP has to take a back seat. As for the Japanese government response, I don’t see any new information, so it’s logical to assume nothing will change. We just continue to decouple, and encourage others to take sensible measures to limit risks to their supply chain. China is no longer the largest import source for the USA which is wise of them. Japan is also developing alternative sources of Galium. And we continue to regret and apologize unreservedly for any trauma caused from the last war. We really do feel bad about this.

In countries where democratic institutions are strong and independent, Government corruption is low. In countries where leaders are paid a fair wage, legislative corruption is low. In India the executive branch is the all powerful branch and the legislative is only for show when there is no powerful opposition. The Judicial branch is severely gimped by lack of required number of judges. A sufficiently wealthy man can appoint a good lawyer and drag a case - and when a case do reach to a conclusion, it is moved from lower court to district court to high court to Supreme Court. The Police departments suffer from the same lack of manpower and on top that, the threat of punishment transfers that await good officers. And don’t get me started on the media. There is little to no independent media in India. The condition has gotten from bad to worse with the advent of cheap internet and social media and now most media companies can’t afford to loose the revenue from Government advertisement - whoever in power that may be. So why Indian has a broken system like this? After independence, being an elected representative was seen as selfless serving of the people. The problem was - this was overemphasized and salaries of Government official and elected representative were kept extremely low. This worked for a short while with idealists and stalwarts. But with representatives elected to be in charge of millions and billions of rupees of taxpayer money, and paid peanuts, things soon went downhill as it was destined to be. With no means to earn a handsome salary commensurate with the responsibility, talented students never got any incentive to become a politician, serve the people honestly and still earn a good salary. At the top half, Indian political landscape was filled with aristocrats looking to safeguard their interests; businessman, landlords and former feudal lords looking to get high on power; dynastic candidates who got elected just because of their surname. At the bottom half, Indian political landscape got filled up by goons and failure cases with aspiration to earn big, quick and easy. Now in any system - forget democracy, if thieves are in charge, would they create a system where thieves can be caught easily and justice is served quickly irrespective of the perpetrators power and status? That is India. It’s high time minimum education, no serious crime charge and high salary start being a thing in Indian political landscape. The late PM of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew was a great advocate of higher pay for Government Servants [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #JyfOJ] . PS - I don’t really give USA as a prime example of an “uncorrupt” country. Yes, people in USA don’t have to pay a bribe here and there to get things done. There is no low level corruption. But at the high level, corruption is essentially legalized. I would love to explain how “lobbying” works, but look it up and you would know the US political system is no white fairy. Essentially, corporation and interest groups lobby publicly for a set of legislation to be passed in their favour even though it might be harmful for the country. Money and favour many be exchanged, but as long as it is public, it is legal. Incidentally India is also trying to move in the same direction, and have a crude system called “Electoral Bonds”. Through electoral bonds any individual or corporation can donate money to any political party. However, “electoral bonds” is even worse, since the donor can remain anonymous to the general public and only revealed to Election Commission/Supreme Court. This is however legal in India and not classified as bribery. At the public level though - India of today is not much different than India of 5, 10, 20, or 50 years back.

The conditions roughly 4 billion years ago were not the same as now, and, neither were the conditions 3 billion years ago, or 2 billion years ago, or 1 billion years ago, and so forth.

Certain luxury vehicles have abysmal rates of depreciation exceeding fifty percent in the first four years…. If YOU are of a mind to drive such a vehicle and the lease rate reflects a residual value higher than this then yes leasing it is the better route to buying it. I would however NEVER EVER consider a new vehicle with a high rate of depreciation… These are if they are good cars, vehicles to buy used. Thing is they are not very often good cars. They depreciate so quickly for a REASON… the cost of parts, service, unreliability and complexity means they are not good cars used either…. so these vehicles are best avoided all together.."},{"prompt":"What are the most touristic countries in the world?","completion":"Here are [LINKED_TEXT: some] [URL: https://www.truetalks.tech/2023/02/the-worlds-best-places-to-travel-and.html] of the most [LINKED_TEXT: beautiful places] [URL: https://www.truetalks.tech/2023/02/the-worlds-best-places-to-travel-and.html] in the world: [LINKED_TEXT: The Maldives] [URL: https://www.truetalks.tech/2023/02/the-worlds-best-places-to-travel-and.html][LINKED_TEXT: Santorini, Greece] [URL: https://www.truetalks.tech/2023/02/the-worlds-best-places-to-travel-and.html][LINKED_TEXT: Machu Picchu, Peru] [URL: https://www.truetalks.tech/2023/02/the-worlds-best-places-to-travel-and.html][LINKED_TEXT: The Grand Canyon, USA] [URL: https://www.truetalks.tech/2023/02/the-worlds-best-places-to-travel-and.html][LINKED_TEXT: The Great Barrier Reef, Australia] [URL: https://www.truetalks.tech/2023/02/the-worlds-best-places-to-travel-and.html][LINKED_TEXT: Venice, Italy] [URL: https://www.truetalks.tech/2023/02/the-worlds-best-places-to-travel-and.html][LINKED_TEXT: Petra, Jordan] [URL: https://www.truetalks.tech/2023/02/the-worlds-best-places-to-travel-and.html][LINKED_TEXT: Halong Bay, Vietnam] [URL: https://www.truetalks.tech/2023/02/the-worlds-best-places-to-travel-and.html][LINKED_TEXT: Banff National Park, Canada] [URL: https://www.truetalks.tech/2023/02/the-worlds-best-places-to-travel-and.html][LINKED_TEXT: The Northern Lights, Scandinavia] [URL: https://www.truetalks.tech/2023/02/the-worlds-best-places-to-travel-and.html] [LINKED_TEXT: For More information] [URL: https://www.truetalks.tech/2023/02/the-worlds-best-places-to-travel-and.html] [LINKED_TEXT: The World’s Best Places to Travel and Explore] [URL: https://www.truetalks.tech/2023/02/the-worlds-best-places-to-travel-and.html]"},{"prompt":"Bangladesh more powerful and prosperous than Pakistan?","completion":"Credit belongs to the innovative nature of the people of Bangladesh.

So after I finished school I travelled on my own mainly because none of my friends wanted to go where I was going. Also with everyone busy with their lives,it was hard to align my free time with theirs. And the larger the group, the tougher it go hence sometimes the plan never materializing. So I always found it easy to just plan by myself and head out. Once in a while I do notify others (a select few) about my plan asking them if they want to join in without changing any of my plan.

For example, you know that if you have a system of homogeneous equations of [math]m[/math] equations in [math]n[/math] unknowns, their solution will form some subspace of [math]mathbf R^n.[/math] Determining which subspace is the problem.

Should I let him?","completion":"One of the answers says, “Don’t make an issue of things that don’t matter.” I totally agree with that. I was dating a woman whose teenage daughter had been in foster care because they had such a difficult relationship. The daughter came back to live with her while we were dating. The mom was very controlling and had to have everything a certain way. One of her rules was that the daughter had to do all her internet cruising in her room. The daughter kept breaking this rule and would cruise on her phone downstairs on the sofa. The mom was so exasperated that her kid could not obey this simple rule, that she complained to me about it. I listened to her vent until she ran out of steam, then replied, “Deborah, your daughter has been gone for a year. She doesn’t want to be isolated in her room, she wants to BE WITH YOU. Why do you care so much where she quietly does her thing? It makes no difference to you, but it makes a big difference to her.” I saw a lightbulb go on in her eyes. I saw her about a week later and she told me her relationship with her daughter had completely changed. Deborah had questioned every one of her own arbitrary rules, and thrown out every one that didn’t matter. The two were much more relaxed. They were talking and watching movies together. Laughing and enjoying each other’s company. Getting to know each other as people. I give Deborah mad props for being able to let go of her rigid ways in the interest of building a more peaceful relationship with her daughter. She and I broke up after a short fling, but what she learned while we were together probably changed both their lives."},{"prompt":"Can you describe your wholeday routine at an IIT/NIT?","completion":"oWhen students prepare for JEE, then their teacher says that “ Beta bas IIT Nikal lo, phir padhai Nahi Karni padegi “.

Wouldn't that be more effective than having an open bunker on top of a hill?","completion":"It’s been done - it was occasionally done in WWII (and the lead-up to), often indeed putting the entire tank in the ground and concreting it in place. But generally it would only be done with obsolete tanks, as new-builds would be very expensive. For example, a modern M1 tank costs several million dollars, of which quite a bit will have gone on the gun, targeting systems and armour. By comparison a concrete bunker will probably cost tens of thousands; some concrete, some steel and the labour and machinery to build it. In contemporary warfare the immobile turret would also be highly vulnerable - a bunker can be camouflaged to make it near invisible to most sensors, and a tank can move away - an emplaced turret can do neither. You’d probably have to add the cost of dozens of decoys to the bill to make them survivable."},{"prompt":"ving at 62, I have no pension. I haven’t payed enough in for old age pension and I am alone.

It consists of quartz, feldspar, mica, and hornblende along with other trace minerals to provide almost endless color and pattern varieties. It is acid resistant and does not itch easily with everyday use. It’s very robust, which is why kitchen counter tops are a perfect pick. Marble is limestone that has been metamorphosed. In fact, shells of mammals, corals, bones, and even plant matter etc. settle in water basins. In the course of time, this is compressed into a solid material we call calcareous. If conditions are correct, the rock beneath the earth will be heated and compressed, where it will turn into marble. Because much of the composition of marble is calcite, it reacts with acids like lemon, vinegar, tomato, some cleaning agents, etc. [LINKED_TEXT: Galaxy Marmo] [URL: http://www.galaxymarmo.com/] has a vast array of marble, stone, granite and other architectural surfaces that extend through an enormous variety.

Here are 5 reasons to lease vs buy a car: Car leasing gets a bad rap, probably because it’s not car buying. We’ve been trained to buy and own things, especially big-ticket items like homes and cars. For many people, big-ticket items are investments that are intended to last for a long time. You buy a home so you have a literal home base to come back to and hope that your property appreciates in value. When you buy a car, you don’t expect the value of a car to go up, but you do buy a car. You buy it so you can get from point A to point B. The math of car ownership doesn’t work in the same way that home ownership does. So what? For a group of thoughtful, smart, and--yes, conservative--people, the calculus has shifted more toward leasing instead of buying their cars. Their reasons are personal, financial, and even social. Read on and find out if you might be one of those people. Choice and Flexibility [caption id=\\"attachment_1348\\" align=\\"alignnone\\" width=\\"560\\"] Image c/o [LINKED_TEXT: Amazingly Simple Graphic Design Software] [URL: http://canva.com/][/caption] We’re living in a golden age of choice and flexibility. You can choose to pursue different paths in your career--why not go from accounting to marketing if you can break in? You can change your life and easily find the resources that’ll help you do it--so you want to live and work in Croatia? Here’s a list of resources for expats, complete with stories of how they put together their lives and a list of links to other useful resources that were helpful to them along the way. If you’re resourceful, you can even leapfrog between important relationships, whether those relationships are personal or professional — hello, Tinder and Bumble Bizz. The choices that are available to us give us flexibility, time, and freedom, and the people who take full advantage of that flexibility optimize the parts of their lives where it’s easy and cost-effective trade money for flexibility. Leasing a car is not a long-term commitment. The reasons for not committing to something long-term varies from person to person, but not wanting to commit to a single car that continuously depreciates and needs increasing maintenance over time means needing more flexibility, from (relative) freedom from maintenance costs to the ability to trade in a car for a different one at the end of a lease term. For people who value flexibility, leasing a car can be a strong lifestyle choice as well as a philosophical one. Maintenance [caption id=\\"\\" align=\\"alignnone\\" width=\\"631\\"] Image c/o [LINKED_TEXT: NerdWallet: Get more from your money] [URL: http://nerdwallet.com/][/caption] Leasing a car will help you save time and money on maintenance. Newer cars simply don’t need as much upkeep as an aging one. If you decide that leasing a car makes sense for you and your life, you have access to a car and can simply use it for the things you want and need to do. Take the example of Chris, who recently had to take his car to the dealership for maintenance. One visit soon turned into four as the time and money that needed to go into his car mounted. Craig, another car owner, wanted to get new tires for his car, but each time he has turned up at the shop, the wait time was 90 minutes to two hours. So far, Craig has decided against waiting his turn and aims to visit at a time when the wait time would be shorter. In the meantime, he’s been to the garage twice. Hopefully, the third time can be the charm. Don't Fret About Maintenance Costs Now think about someone who has decided to squeeze more flexibility (that word again) out of their life by leasing a car. The maintenance costs should be low. After all, leased cars are generally new, and new cars typically don’t need much maintenance. Chances are there wouldn’t be the need to take the car in for tire changes either--leased cars typically get driven 10,000-12,000 miles per year, and modern tires are meant to withstand 50,000-60,000 miles of driving. Take into account a typical lease term of 3 years (or 30,000-36,000 miles), and the tires will still be going strong by the end of the lease. If you’re someone who optimizes your life and your time, leasing a car can help buy back some of your time and mental energy. This should free you up to enjoy your hobbies, spend time with the people you care about and do great work in your career. Leasing a car can be one an almost pure way of making sure that your car is serving you and not the other way around. And if you want to make sure you’re doing everything in a cost-effective way, think about... Lower Monthly Payments [caption id=\\"\\" align=\\"alignnone\\" width=\\"638\\"] IMAGE C/O TIM MCALPINE OF IT’S A MONEY THING[/caption] If you’re the type who pays for your cars in cash, congratulations. You are much more liquid and adult than some of us are. For everyone else, if you’re not going to put an ungodly number of miles on a car, you should end up paying somewhat less per month to lease your car than if you were making car payments on the same car as an owner. (For a definition of “ungodly number of miles,” look at a few lease options. Most lease agreements want you to drive no more than 10,000-12,000 miles a year before additional mileage fees kick in.) On top of making lower monthly payments to drive the same (late-model) car, leasing a car usually means that your monthly costs of having a car are predictable and controlled (you’re not driving crazy distances above the annual mileage limits you agreed on in your lease, right? Right?). This means no nasty surprise repairs (for a refresher, visit the last section on how maintenance needs are fewer for leased cars) and a car that already performs pretty well because it’s relatively new. If you like to pay less money per month to drive the same car--whether you’re driving it for work or yourself--leasing could be an option that gets you peace of mind around your money and logistics. And speaking of saving money... Tax Benefits [caption id=\\"\\" align=\\"alignnone\\" width=\\"684\\"] Image c/o [LINKED_TEXT: http://TimeSheets.com] [URL: http://timesheets.com/][/caption] Ah, the tax code. Unless you’re a tax attorney or an accountant, chances are you’re not jumping for joy to talk about taxes. But if you lease a car or are thinking about leasing one, here are a few key things to know about the tax code. It could benefit you. Using a Leased Car for Business If you’re using your leased car at least partially for work, you can get a tax break. You may know that companies get tax breaks on their leased vehicles. Thank you, business-friendly tax incentives. What you may not know is that you can get tax breaks on your leased car as an individual. In general, some portion of the total amount you pay on your car lease in a year plus gas and maintenance could be tax deductible. How big that portion is depends on how much of your car use is for personal vs. professional reasons. This means you’ll need to track your car usage. For instance, if you use your leased car for work 60% of the time, 60% of the total expenses for your car for the year are tax deductible. Using a Leased Car While You Are Self-Employed If you’re self-employed, you can deduct the business-related expenses related to your car by using what’s called a standard mileage rate. You can choose to use the standard mileage rate for your deductions in your first year. If you do that, you must stick with using the standard mileage rate for your deductions for the duration of your lease. The standard mileage rate was 53.5 cents per mile in 2017 and 54.0 cents per mile in 2016. You can also deduct business-related parking fees and tolls, but the tax code changes regularly, so consult a tax accountant so you don’t make any assumptions. If you’re self-employed, talk to your accountant to figure out the best approach for you so you can start tracking your usage. If you’re already using your car for work and work for an employer, your employer might be able to connect you to a resource who could talk to you about your taxes. Look for an in-house tax expert, someone in-house who could connect you to an outside resource, or find a tax expert through your EAP (employee assistance provider)--usually outsourced to a third party. Depending on the plan, those experts could be free to you. Don't Miss Tax Breaks from Owning a Car If you’re worried about missing out on tax breaks by leasing instead of buying a car, don’t worry. There are opportunities for deductions. Take a moment to grieve the depreciation deduction--you don’t own it, you can’t deduct the depreciation--and celebrate not owning a car that’s losing value. If tax considerations were standing between you and a decision to lease a car that could make your life easier and more stylish, Worry less andDon’t think so much about the tax code. Go live your life! Meanwhile, more of your thoughtful peers are leasing cars instead of buying them because of... Technology [caption id=\\"\\" align=\\"alignnone\\" width=\\"620\\"] Image c/o [LINKED_TEXT: http://Resources.Stuff.co] [URL: http://resources.stuff.co/][/caption] This is almost glib, but it’s true. Technology has helped us do everything from posting photos of our dinner to finding an apartment. Of course it would play a role in helping us easily lease cars too. The traditional car leasing experience involves visiting multiple dealerships and talking to leasing agents until you find one who gives you a rate that you like on a car that you like. Then, you agree to let them run a credit check on you and wait to find out if you’re still a good candidate in their eyes and whether you’ll be able to keep the rate that you like. Want to Find Advice Online? If you’re not a fan of legwork, you might like working with a platform like [LINKED_TEXT: The Car You Desire, Delivered. – Carlease.com] [URL: http://carlease.com/]. You don’t need to personally visit dealerships (unless you’re extremely hands-on), you can talk to their unbiased advisors who have no skin in the game whether you lease a run-of-the-mill sedan or a souped-up luxury car. Plus, the platform helps you gather bids from banks who want your business. Platforms like [LINKED_TEXT: Carlease.com] [URL: https://carlease.com/] do what technology does best: it helps minimize or eliminate legwork and gathers data from multiple sources (e.g. different rates and bids) to help users (that’s you) make the best decision. New platforms will even help you swap out your lease if you need to end it early. Technology at work! If you’re the kind of person who’s comfortable using technology to make your life run more smoothly and easily--to save yourself some work--it’s never been easier to lease a car without doing a bunch of research first. And in case you had other questions about the smart, thoughtful people who are leasing their cars, just look at… (Bonus:) Our Changing Culture [caption id=\\"\\" align=\\"alignnone\\" width=\\"600\\"] Image c/o [LINKED_TEXT: Let TOAD Create or Reskin Your Next Great Mobile Game] [URL: http://toappdevelop.com/][/caption] Have you looked around and seen your Facebook feed lately? Ever see ads for subscription boxes? Ever see posts about interesting products, activities, or ideas that came through a subscription service? We’re living in a culture of sampling and subscribing. Because of considerations around choice, costs, convenience, and the technological ability to make it happen, we’re now able to sample and subscribe to a huge variety of products, from the completely necessary to the silly and just-for-fun. Here are some of the things you can subscribe to and sample: Razors. Pretty necessaryClothes. Convenient and cost-effective, especially if you like designer dudsChildren’s toys/activity packs. Convenient, fun, and packs the excitement of receiving something unknown every monthRecords. Like giving yourself a surprise present once a month, but with music on vinylJapanese snacks. Strictly fun for most people. Deadly-serious and necessary for people who love Japan or are obsessed with exotic snacks In fact, the futurists at Ford--people whose main work is to talk about trends that’ll guide us into the next x years--wrote about sampling and living smarter as ongoing social trends in their most recent report. This idea of “living smarter” is what drives thoughtful people to subscribe to services and subscription boxes that can streamline and enrich their lives. At its root, smarter living is what drives the decision to lease instead of buying a car. Leasing a car is simply subscribing to a (new and cool-to-you) car. Smarter Living, Smarter Leasing For many smart, conservative people who are thoughtful about their decisions, leasing a car is the way to go. In a life that could involve demanding careers, busy families, and too little time to spend on hobbies and friends, taking back your time and mental energy by controlling your monthly spending on having access to a late-model car, not worrying about maintenance, taking advantage of the flexibility it gives you--all while deducting relevant expenses from your tax bill--could be the most conservative financial and lifestyle decision. Whether or not leasing a car is right for you, you need to make the right decision for your life. So look at the factors that matter most to you and use that to guide your decision.

Just don't spoil your interviews. Keep your spirits high.I have no idea about the rest companies."},{"prompt":"w do I create my own mailing address?","completion":"To create your own mailing address follow the following steps: Back in the day, AOL had a cool service that let you create a custom domain email address for free and you could use any domain name you wanted, even if it was already registered. I have no idea how it worked, but it was gone after a short while and I can see why! You can still create a personalized email address, but it’s not possible without paying. The reason for that is because you need to first purchase a domain name in order to setup the email for that domain. So in order to get a personalized domain email address, you first have to register a domain. This also means that you are limited in what your “personalized” email address can be. If a domain is already registered, you won’t be able to buy it and therefore won’t be able to send email via that domain name. Of course, if you really wanted to send an email from any email address, you could create your own email server and send out fake emails, but then you would be a certified hacker/spammer and we’re not going to teach anything like that in this article. So let’s break the process up into parts and hopefully you can find the domain you’re looking for. You’ll probably get what you want if you’re looking to send emails for a wedding or something similar and want to create a custom email like [LINKED_TEXT: invite@jackandkelly.com] [URL: mailto:invite@jackandkelly.com] or [LINKED_TEXT: gettingmarried@wendyandchris.com] [URL: mailto:gettingmarried@wendyandchris.com]. If you’re looking to send email from [LINKED_TEXT: tomandkate@love.com] [URL: mailto:tomandkate@love.com], you’re going to be out of luck because [LINKED_TEXT: Brand Love - Oath] [URL: http://love.com/] is definitely already registered. Find a Domain First, let’s look for a domain that is available. Remember, that the email doesn’t have to always end in .COM either. Recently, a whole slew of new top-level domains were opened up, which means you can have a domain that ends in things like .fitness or .investments or .photography. The best site I like to use for searching for domains is [LINKED_TEXT: Cheap Domain Names - Buy Domain Names from 0.88 - Namecheap] [URL: http://namecheap.com/]. It lets you search for a keyword and then will give you all the options you could possibly imagine for that keyword. Click Search and you’ll see four tabs across the top: Popular, New, International and Favorites. In the example below, I search for jackandkate to see what was available. Unfortunately, [LINKED_TEXT: jack and kate coming soon] [URL: http://jackandkate.com/] and .net are not available, but others like .rocks and .me are! jackandkate.rocks actually sounds pretty cool. If you were to send an email, it would be something like wedding@jackandkate.rocks. The part before the @ symbol can be anything you want. You can scroll down and click the See other options link to see other available options for that domain name. Also, some of them have a little lightning icon next to the name and if you hover over it, it will tell you the restriction for that domain name. For example, if you want [LINKED_TEXT: http://jackandkate.ca] [URL: http://jackandkate.ca/], you’ll need to have Canadian residence in order to get it. If none of those suit your fancy, click on the New tab and it’ll show you the options available with all the new top-level domains. You’ll notice immediately that these are also a lot more expensive than the traditional ones. Once you find a domain you are happy it, purchase it and then read on to the next section, which will show you how to set up your email using NameCheap also. Actually, read the section below before buying the domain from NameCheap because you can add 2 free months of email hosting when checking out. Setup Email Hosting When you are purchasing your domain, you’ll see the option to add email hosting on NameCheap and what I really love is that it’s free for 2 months! For most people, you might only need the email address for a couple of weeks while sending invitations, etc. If you need it for longer, it’s very cheap email hosting. Go ahead and click the add to cart button for the free private email and it will bring you to another page where you can choose the email addresses you would like. By default, it gives you one email address for free which starts with [LINKED_TEXT: admin@whateveryourdomain.com] [URL: mailto:admin@whateveryourdomain.com]. However, you can just uncheck that and check the custom blank box at the bottom and that will become your free one. If you want more than one custom email address with that domain, it’ll be 0.25 per email address. Now just follow through the checkout process, during which you’ll have to create an account. Once you’re done, click on the Manage Account button or go back to the homepage and click Sign In. Once you are logged in, go to the Dashboard and you’ll see a whole bunch of links. The one you want to click on is Open-Xchange Email domains. Now you will see the domain name listed and you have to click on that. If you bought more than one domain, you have to select the domain you want to manage email for. Now in order to get your email setup, you first have to create the mailbox. I thought that it would do that on its own since I had typed in the custom domain name I wanted, but apparently, you have to do it manually. Go ahead and click on the Setup New Mailbox button. Type in the local part of the email address you would like, then give your mailbox a password and then click the Create Mailboxes button. On the next page, click the Proceed button. Finally, click on the Subscription Management button to get back to the main email screen. Finally, you’ll see it gives you the URL for managing your email. By default, this will just be mail.domainname.whatever. So since my domain is aseemkishore.rocks, I would go to mail.aseemkishore.rocks to manage my email. It’s worth noting that when you click that link, you might get an error page and that’s because if you just registered the domain, the DNS settings have to propagate across the Internet and that can take up to 48 hours. In my case, it only took about 30 minutes and then it was redirecting to the email client. However, if you want immediate access, the link should be in the Private Email email that you get from NameCheap. Here’s the URL for managing email if you can’t find it: [LINKED_TEXT: https://privateemail.com/appsuite/signin] [URL: https://privateemail.com/appsuite/signin] Now you have to log in using the email address you just created and the password you just set for that mailbox. My username is support@aseemkishore.rocks in my example. Don’t use the login info for your NameCheap account as that won’t work. Once you’re in, you’ll see the interface for the email client used by NameCheap. It’s got a clean interface and works perfectly fine for most purposes. Now to send your first email, just click the Compose link and send away! I sent an email to my Gmail account and it came through in a few seconds just fine. The great thing about NameCheap is that it also supports IMAP, so you can use Outlook or whatever email client you want to manage your email. They also have the option to forward all the email from that account to another one if you like. So that’s all there is to it! It’s a bit of a process and it will take you about an hour to do all of this, but if you really want a personalized email address, this is really the only way to go about it. Of course, you can register your domain anywhere and there are hundreds of email hosting companies, but I just recommend NameCheap because I think it gives you the best value for the price and it’s very easy to use.

I would compare it to a language. If you were to hear someone speaking Russian on the radio and had no previous knowledge of the Russian language, you would definitely not understand what was being said. However, the actual sound of the language to your ears might be pleasing, or it might not. If you kept listening day in day out to this radio station that only spoke Russian, you might eventually start picking up on words here and there and start to understand what they mean. The sound of the language is starting to have a new meaning to you, a truer, deeper meaning. As time goes by and the weeks past, you now start to pick up on short phrases. As the radio plays, you understand little bits of what is being said. As the months pass by and you get more and more drawn in to this new language full of intricacies, you start to get more and more interested in it. You might even start to study the language to try and understand more of what is being said. Eventually, after months of daily listening to the Russian radio station, you now understand nearly all of what is being said and the sound of the language has a completely different meaning to you because you can understand what is being said and communicated. When you decide to fly over to Russia for a vacation, you can understand any type of sentence coming from anyone even though all of them speak in different ways and do not speak exactly the same way because they are using the common Russian language. You could compare all of the different ways everyone in Russia speaks Russian to jazz improvisation. In jazz, no one improvises exactly the same way but everyone is using a common idiom (compared to Russian here). In Russia, no one speaks the exact same way, they all speak(speaking compared to improvising in jazz) in different ways and create many different sentences that mean different things and transmit different feelings and emotions. In both jazz and Russian, there is a common language that needs to be understood before understanding people speaking the language and before the overall sound of the idiom has a deeper meaning to you. Once you grasp onto this idiom and understand it, a whole new world opens up and you realize just how much of a genius the great speakers of the Russian language (great jazzmen) were and just how much they knew. Before any prior knowledge of the Russian language, however, you could not understand why these so called great Russian speakers on the radio were so good and why they were looked upon with so much admiration by all other Russian speakers (all other understanders of the jazz idiom). You could not understand why these great Russian speakers were any greater than the normal Russian speakers. It had the same overall sound to your ears and while you could enjoy this sound maybe five minutes, after that it became unpleasant and you would just get annoyed at yourself for not understanding what was so great about it, and why these certain Russian speakers were greater than others. Another very good comparison to make to jazz is Chinese writing. If you were to look at Chinese writing for the first time without any prior knowledge of the Chinese language, you would dismiss it as being just random lines on a piece of paper that have no meaning (you could compare this to people saying jazz is just random notes). You might acknowledge that the forms of the lines and their arrangement on the paper is beautiful and might look at one page for one minute, but would definitely not spend hours looking at books full of Chinese writings (you might acknowledge that the overall, general sound of jazz is beautiful, but would definitely not spend hours upon hours listening to these random notes which are noise to your ear). You cannot understand why so many people are reading books and books of Chinese writings that are hundreds of pages long. You think the books are full of random scribbles and unless you make an effort to understand the language by studying or listening to it, you will always be left in the dark about what is so great about this whole world of Chinese writings. You are missing out on thousands and thousands of stories and emotions that would get to you through the reading of the books if you understood the language. You are missing out on a whole new world that would bring you much joy if you were to understand it. If you open yourself up to it and spend time and effort to try to understand it, even though the first months are torturous and you are forcing yourself to try to understand jazz, eventually you will start to pick up on the jazz idiom (language) and a whole new world will open up to you. It is a world full of stories that will transmit all types of emotions, anywhere from sadness to unbelievable happiness and everything in between."},{"prompt":"what ways was Christianity morally superior to the paganism it replaced?","completion":"None at all.

In the 1990 MIT students took over 400,000 in one weekend out of the casinos in Las Vegas,\\" says Gordon Adams, a casino security investigator. [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #PLQEA] In Las Vegas, the house always wins — unless you're a math whiz from MIT. Through the years, a group of math students at the world-famous Massachusetts Institute of Technology has focused their considerable brain power on a very extracurricular activity: gambling — specifically blackjack. The students realized that blackjack was the only beatable game in casino gambling — and beat it they did. By the 1990s, the team — whose membership rotated over the years — was making regular trips to Las Vegas and winning big. The team used a method known as card-counting, which helps players predict when the cards being dealt will be favorable to them. By knowing which cards have been spent and which ones remain in the shoe, savvy players can keep a running \\"count\\" which works as a rough predictor of how many high cards are left. High cards work to a player's benefit because they boost the odds that they will beat the dealer. The MIT players were not the first to count cards. But they used their math expertise — and advanced computer models — to hone their skills to a devastatingly effective science. They wrote computer programs to devise the best strategy for specific situations, then updated their data with real-life experience. \\"After a trip to Vegas, we would enter all the information about what happened into the computers,\\" remembers Semyon Dukach, a student who was a member of the team in the early 1990s. New members of the team were \\"trained\\" for weeks or months, starting on MIT's Cambridge, Mass., campus, then getting experience in backroom card games in Boston's Chinatown. Then they would be sent to Vegas, where they would start out as a \\"mule\\" carrying cash, then work their way up in the team's hierarchy. The team visited Las Vegas regularly, peaking in the 1990s with trips nearly every weekend. When they hit a casino, they would first deploy a counter to sit in on a table and track the cards. When the counter calculated that the high cards were coming up, he or she would secretly signal the team's designated \\"big bettor\\" to the table, using code words to signal how \\"positive\\" the shoe was. The big bettor would then start wagering large amounts of money until the counter would signal that the shoe was no longer \\"hot.\\" Other games such as Slot machines are random, Roullette is about probability & Poker is about bluffing. Card counting isnt illegal but Casinoes ask you to leave casino if you are found “Counting Card” or make the rules difficult so Counting wont help. Most important aspect of Gambling is being Random, winners are chosen Randomly there’s no Sequence where else Mathematics is about probability based on Numbers Sequencing. Mathematics cant predict random numbers otherwise not only Las Vegas but all Casinoes would have been destroyed by Mathematacians around the Globe.

At the time, there was no concept of “Palestinians”, nor would there be until the first Palestinian National Charter in 1964. That charter specifically waived the Palestinian claim on the West Bank, eastern Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip: “Article 24: This Organization does not exercise any territorial sovereignty over the West Bank in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, on the Gaza Strip or in the Himmah Area. Its activities will be on the national popular level in the liberational, organizational, political and financial fields.” [LINKED_TEXT: Permanent Observer Mission of the State of Palestine to the United Nations] [URL: https://web.archive.org/web/20140806011135/http://www.un.int/wcm/content/site/palestine/cache/offonce/pid/12363;jsessionid=293C499750EF77F0019ADF7A3D04A9C8] Apparently, as long as the areas were under Arab control, they weren’t “Palestinian territory”."},{"prompt":"What is wrong with my washing machine?

They are excellent at hunting, in fact they are nature’s best hunter, and as every living creature, they still have a strong instinct, yes, it does include human too.The same way some people can’t stop themselves from committing sexual abuse because they can’t fight their urge (which is reproduction instinct, instinct isn’t an autopilot or a list of rules you know, it is how you are emotionally pushed into some behaviors), cats that still have their hormones telling them that they need to breed, own a territory and manage it will want to do it. Unlike what many say, cats are really loving their owners, they are just showing it on a completely different way than we are used to, but they are still free, as any human, to choose to leave someone, and the same way couples breaks and people cheat on other, cats too can leave you, mainly knowing that their instinct tell them that they do prefer hunting than having easy food, that they need to expand their territory which should be much bigger than your house. Also, to add to that, while cats are vital to human by controlling pest that would ruin human civilization, when they are too numerous, they also cause arm to the ecosystem,sterilizing/neutering your cat is good for him/her as he/she won’t have this uncontrollable urge to reproduce, and it will help to avoid to cause too many stray cats to cause problems while living harsh life. Sources : And having fed a stray pussycat who gave birth to multiple kittens, most died, one of which we were able to adopt, and she is basically traumatized of her life outside and wouldn’t have survived if we didn’t feed her, she also gave birth to 5 kittens before we could take her home, and thankfully all of them have been adopted."},{"prompt":"What are some NLP techniques every data scientist must know?","completion":"If you want to learn NLP, I would suggest you to follow Stanford CS224(they released hw and everything), instead of following [LINKED_TEXT: Mike West] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Mike-West-99] links.

Sanjana(Kizie) is very impressive with his role and his cuteness and the simpleness give the nice back to the role. And the kizie's parents are best on their role.

Wonder why? Here are a few things I've learned in my 12-year career as a national best-selling author! This graph is the most accurate representation of my journey! Honesty is what people care about! Everyone wants to follow a trend in the chaotic writing industry. Only a few people have the courage and determination to deviate from the status quo and effect change. Often, aspiring writers become entangled in this web. They begin by copying trends and styles that have worked for other well-known authors, and they overlook the most important aspect of writing a book: being unique and true to themselves. So, always write what you want to read, not what you think others will enjoy reading. The most recent book that defied stereotypes is \\"The rudest book ever\\"! 2. Good things take time I see so many young aspiring writers in such a hurry to get published that they neglect to work on laying the foundation. Making mistakes and learning from them is the one unchanging rule of writing a book. When you write draft after draft of the same story, you realise how much more there is to explore than you initially began with. As you write more, you should try out different writing styles and concentrate more on character and plot development. Every author dreams of being a sensation overnight, but they forget even JK Rowling was rejected 12 times before becoming one of the most celebrated authors of all time. So, Always remember even overnight success can take years to achieve. 3. Increase your knowledge This point cannot be emphasised enough. Reading extensively will increase your vocabulary, and once you begin to read attentively, you will start to notice writing styles, sentence formation, and basic writing structure in every book you pick. Reading more also aids in the development of new ideas and the overall shaping of the existing plotline. If you're perplexed, read to clear your mind, and when you're bursting at the seams, write! 4. Be comfortable with Criticism I've always admired my friends' ability to be objective critics of my work. When I first started writing, they read my work on a regular basis, praised me, but also suggested a few changes. Their feedback assisted me in reworking areas where I lacked as well as gaining a reader's perspective. There were times when I wrote something I was extremely proud of but they didn't find it as exciting, but I always made sure to take something constructive from it and improve my work. Take note: Choose people who will give you honest feedback and can point you in the right direction. 5. Practice writing Just write, and keep writing. Even on days where you feel like skipping, write at least a paragraph or sentence. It can be completely different from your story but it will help keep up the habit. Once you develop the habit of writing every day, you will never feel tired of rewriting drafts after drafts of your book. Don't try to replicate things; instead, create a habit that leads to the desired outcome. Want to write to me?

Poor posture: Poor posture can put unnecessary strain on the various structures of the spine and result in back pain over time. Bulging Discs: Discs act as shock absorbers to reduce stress on your spine and are located between your bony vertebrae. Disc injuries are common. They can appear as a result of sudden movements or from long-term postural stress, cause inflammation and pain, and in extreme cases can irritate nearby spinal nerves. This can cause radiating leg pain, tingling and numbness (often misdiagnosed as sciatica). Facet joint sprains: Each of your vertebrae is connected to a vertebra above and below by two joints called facet joints, which can be sprained, as can your ankle if you move awkwardly. As with a sprained ankle, if the facet joints become inflamed, you will experience back pain and limited range of motion. Sciatica: Sciatica is the Latin word for \\"pain in the back of the leg.\\" Sciatica refers to pain usually caused by irritation of the sciatic nerve in the lower back. The sciatic nerve runs from the lower back, down the back of the thigh and calf, and into the foot. When compressed, the sciatic nerve can cause lower back pain that may radiate to the leg or buttocks. It can also cause tingling, numbness, muscle spasms, reduced flexibility and weakness. There are several more serious reasons for lower back pain, such as disc injury, fracture, cancer, and infection. If you are suffering from sciatica or lower back pain then I have a unique solution which is to use the Acu-hump Sciatica Massager. Acu-hump sciatica stretcher is a portable and ergonomic glute massager tool. It is designed to mimic a chiropractor’s fingers, and it can be used to apply pressure points therapy on the affected area that allows you to self massage deep tissue.

Doflamingo is the literal embodiment of what a villain is. He doesn’t have any tragic backstory or reason for what he does he just does it because he wants to be in control. He wants everything to go his way and he would do anything to do so. In the one piece manga there’s something known as a “warlord” which is a pirate who has a contract working with the government. The marines have to choose who they want as a warlord however doflamingo tricked the government into becoming one. What did he do with that power? He tricked the rightful king of a country known as “dressrosa” into killing his own people. Why? Because he wanted to enslave the people of the country. He entered the kings room one night and told him he would die if he didn’t hand over all of his, and his citizens money. The king begged the citizens, who were mostly poor, for their money and they gave it to him because they trusted him. However when the king went out in public to ask and beg for their money doflamimgo quite literally used him as a puppet. There’s another thing in one piece called “devil fruits” and doflamingos devil fruit is known as the “ito ito no mi”. He can attach strings to things and even use them as weapons using this devil fruit power, so while the king was in public he attached a string to him and forced him to slaughter his own people. No one knew this was really the work of doflamingo besides one soldier known as kyros. Kyros did everything in his power to stop doflamingo but in the end got his leg cut off and got cursed to where everyone forgot him. Eventually doflamingo knocks the king out and everyone sees him as a hero. Doflamingo became the new king in his “heroic” act. 10 years later the main character of the manga comes around and sets free doflamingos slaves, which angers him. Because of this he set his entire island inside of what he called the “bird cage” which was really his strings that were strong enough to cut a canon ball apart. While everyone was trapped in here he manipulated all of them the same way he did with the king 10 years ago. Throughout the 10 years he was king he murdered and raped innocent citizens without anyone else knowing, why? Because he set the same curse on them he did with the kings bet soldier."},{"prompt":"What's your favourite British myth or legend?","completion":"King Arthur and the round table. This has recently been discussed again due to the discovery that the blue stones at Stonehenge were originaly part of a much older Welsh stone circle, before being moved to its current site. This was discovered in Waun Mawn, in West Wales. This was proven because a specific blue stone with an unusual shape at the bottom fitted perfectly into one of the ghost holes in Wales, and the blue stone (which can have different minerals depending on where it was mined) matched perfectly with remnants left in the pits when they were removed. Much speculation has been made about why they were moved. Was it because of unification of people, and the discovery of a special new site with natural earth markings aligned with the solstice? (Chalk grooves in the earth left after the last ice age, discovered in recent years, pointing towards the ‘entrance’ of Stonehenge). Or, were they stolen and taken to the new site because of their special significance? The oldest stories about King Arthur (900 years old) talk about Merlin leading men to Ireland to capture a magical stone circle and bringing it back to England as a monument to the dead. This part of Wales was considered part of Ireland at the time. Coincidence? This story was always discounted, but it does make you think. Our ancient past was taught through oral history. When things were later written down it was done by the monks in Churches, and were then destroyed by Vikings, so we lost those links to our past. However, that oral history could still have been passing down the stories, eventually leading to that story from 900 years ago being written down.

However back to your question assuming the attacker knew his stuff and failed all your brake hydraulics. This leaves you with only the hand brake to slow the car down by brakes. If this was cut then no direct braking available. To slow the vehicle in this situation selecting the lowest possible gear whilst keeping the engine going you will have to initially raise engine speed dramatically, to have a chance of getting the lowest possible forward gear. Keep your feet off the accelerator from now on . Assuming the handbrake still works, a combination of low gears If speed allows you to get them and application of handbrake if working. , Do not touch the accelerator provided you are not going down a steep hill the vehicle should be losing speed now. From now on the only way of slowing to a stop is to switch off the engine whilst still in the lowest gear you can select. Care is needed now, as the steering lock might be activated so switch to aux ( engine off position ) . Now you should have lost a lot speed and can decide if it is safe to shut the engine off completely. The car should, slow to a stop as there is no power and the dead engine will act as a brake.

The key to mitigating this risk lies in diversification, which involves spreading your investments across various asset classes. By doing so, you reduce the impact of poor performance from a single investment on your overall portfolio. For steady, long-term gains, consider including stocks, bonds, real estate, and other investment instruments in your portfolio. Harness the Power of Compound Interest In the realm of finance, few forces rival the potency of compound interest. This phenomenon allows your money to grow exponentially over time. By reinvesting your earnings, you generate additional returns on your initial investment. Embrace this strategy early on, and even small amounts can metamorphose into significant wealth in the long run. Invest in High-Quality Stocks Throughout history, stocks have outperformed many other assets. To capitalize on their potential, seek out well-established companies with strong fundamentals, stable earnings, and a proven history of growth. Prioritize thorough research of the company's financials and industry trends before making your investment. Explore the World of Real Estate Real estate can be an invaluable addition to your investment portfolio. Ownership of property opens doors to rental income and the possibility of appreciation over time. Tailor your choices between residential or commercial properties based on your risk appetite and investment goals. Consider Bonds and Fixed-Income Investments For relatively stable returns and regular interest payments, look towards bonds and fixed-income investments. Government bonds and high-quality corporate bonds are often perceived as safer options, serving as a cushion during market downturns. Tap into the Potential of Mutual Funds and ETFs Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) present an opportunity to pool resources with other investors to create a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other assets. Their appeal lies in instant diversification and professional management, making them an attractive option for beginners.

Their potential for extraordinary returns intrigues many investors, but they also come with high volatility and regulatory uncertainties. Exercise caution and only invest what you can afford to lose. FAQs 1: What Are the Best Ways to Invest for Beginners? For beginners, the best approach is to start with small investments and embrace diversification. Mutual funds or ETFs are excellent choices as they offer instant diversification and require minimal investment knowledge. 2: How Much Should I Invest in Stocks? The amount you invest in stocks should be based on your risk tolerance and financial goals. Generally, experts recommend allocating around 60% to 70% of your portfolio to stocks for long-term growth. 3: Are Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) a Good Option? Yes, REITs offer a viable option for investors seeking exposure to real estate without direct property ownership. They provide dividends to shareholders and a chance to benefit from real estate assets. 4: Should I Invest in International Markets? Investing in international markets adds diversification to your portfolio but comes with additional risks, including currency fluctuations and geopolitical factors. 5: What Are the Risks of Cryptocurrency Investment? Cryptocurrency investment carries substantial risks due to its high volatility and regulatory uncertainties. Invest only what you can afford to lose. 6: How Can I Minimize Investment Risks? To minimize risks, follow a diversification strategy. Avoid putting all your money into a single investment and regularly review your portfolio to rebalance when needed."},{"prompt":"Do Italians use bechamel in lasagna?","completion":"Lasagna is one of the most popular Italian dishes, beloved around the world for its layers of pasta, cheese, and flavorful sauces.

Chapter II–1 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) defines them as being “a passenger ship with ro-ro cargo spaces or special category spaces.” The largest of them are over 860 feet long and are capable of carrying around 6,000 cars. The average roro goes at a speed of 16 knots and the technology these ships use is honestly insane, including things like decks that can move up and down so larger vehicles can fit.

To me I was in heaven. The land had trees where when you pulled into the driveway during the growing season it was like pulling into a cave. Now I’m old and can’t get around as good anymore. The trees that I loved so much are now a curse. I don’t have the stamina or strength to deal with the fallen limbs and whole downed trees anymore. Once I finally get a hold on the clean up another storm comes through and puts limbs and trees back on the ground. Plus the lawn care… 30 years ago you could buy a riding mower that was built to last a lifetime. Now they are built to barely get you through one season. So the constant repairs on the mower is getting daunting too. So now a tiny house on a cookie-cutter lot with a tiny-tiny lawn looks like heaven to me."},{"prompt":"Why have you chosen to live in the San Francisco Bay area?","completion":"I graduated college in 1980 and moved to Carmel, CA for a job at Hyatt Hotels.

Their sales are doing fine. I observe that Input surfaces seem to work best when they are horizontal and displays seem to work best when they are vertical. (Notice that there are no laptops with horizontal screens and vertical keyboards.) When iPads and Microsoft Surfaces are used at 45°, both input and output are comfortable on the same surface—so they have touch screens. However, when people use them vertically as displays, they tend to touch them less and add keyboards because holding your arms out horizontally for a long time is very tiring. That is probably why Apple makes keyboards for iPads but does not make touch screens for laptops. Back in iPod days, a lot of people wondered why iPods didn't include FM radios. After all, Zune did, and we know what a competitive edge that gave Zune—if you can even remember what a Zune was. Customers were noisy enough that Apple did come out with an FM radio accessory for the iPod, but it wasn’t popular and it faded from the market without anyone noticing. Feel free to diagnose me as weird, but I think computer manufacturers put touch screens in laptops for bragging rights—hey, we have this neat feature that Apple doesn’t have! The people who want touch-screen laptops are vocal, but they are not creating a stampede away from Apple that would cause Apple to change their product."},{"prompt":"What is the string theory about?","completion":"I am a cave man, I have not studied Earth physics that much as yet. But, I have gained little ability to enter different dimensions around us which other writers are discussing here. I goal has been Enlightenment and creating healing technology, therefore i have different point of view. I have just finished watching, Big bang theory, so in that sitcom, a string theory has been discussed a lot, so I did my research on string theory as a cave man. If you did not understand anything said above by other physics scholars I can give you some food for mind through which you can explore string theory on your own. I was travelling and somebody explained me “ String theory like this” he called String theory as Shoe String theory, alright, I made sense of his hypothesis like this, your strings of both shoes are connected in some different dimensions. Which can also be known as Astral Dimensions by a Spiritual Scientist With these eyes we can only see this Physical Dimension,( but when you open your third eye you can enter other Astral Dimensions) there are other dimensions which are less solid than this physical reality where we spend 16 hours a day, if we are sleeping for 8 hours and we enter dream based dimensions, I think you get to experince other dimensions them in sci-fi and superheroes movies. Which which they travel in different times, future or past events. So, shoe strings of your left shoe is connected with the right shoe strings in some different dimension. In spiritual Scriptures they spoke about that we are all one, connected with some invisible threads, individuality is a myth, here I suppose that; Spiritual people have entered these dimensions in their meditation and gathered this information from there where everything is connected with everything through these strings. They called the connectors as love (true love feeling). Healers has different point of view, if they see somebody sick and sufferring too much, they know for sure, that the persons Strings got raptured due to some traumatic incident, so he enters other dimensions and with his intention powers he repairs those broken strings and person is healthy again. Moving to Mr. TESLA I think he entered these dimensions also, his point of view was different, he saw unlimited energy surrounding these strings and he thought of harvesting and transferring those energy to full fill human's insatiable desire for energy in this Dimension. I suppose that's how he thought about transferring current or electricity around without any wires, I think through those strings which connects everything with everything like a membrane in other dimensions. (We need that technology now). I think deep understanding of “String Theory” clearly can bring huge transcending evolution to humanity. Or by evolving our beliefs about life can bring more understanding about String theory. It's a life's saviour theory, I think was solved by Mr.Tesla, either people who got hold of it did not understand it because if their limiting belief system or they want to keep this planet on status quo. I believe they did not understand it clearly, that's why it's not out and helping humanity with its energy needs. We are still destroying for our energy needs, when we are all surrounded by inexhaustible energy around us. The Caveman."},{"prompt":"As a crossdresser, do you like satin silk clothes?

Ghatotkacha Ghatotkacha is the son of Bheema and Hidimbhi. On the fourteenth day of the Kurukshetra, the battle continued past sunset. When the bright moon rose, [LINKED_TEXT: Ghatotkach] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghatotkacha], son of [LINKED_TEXT: Bhima] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhima] slaughtered numerous warriors, attacking while flying in the air. Karna stood against him and both fought fiercely until Karna released the Shakti, a divine weapon given to him by [LINKED_TEXT: Indra] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra]. Ghatotkach increased his size and fell dead on the Kaurav army killing thousands of them. 9. Bheema Bheema is the second of the Pandava brothers. He was known for his macho personality and great power. He killed all the Kaurava brothers including Duryodana. On the 18th day of the battle, when Duryodana ran away from the battlefield and was later found by the Pandavas, he went into a duel with Duryodana and killed him, marking the end of the great battle of Kurukshetra. 8. Drishtadyumna Drishtadyumna is the Commnaner-in-Chief of the Pandava army for all the 18 days of war. He killed Drona and many others in the Kaurava army. After the war is over, Ashwatthama, Kripacharya, and Kritavarma met [LINKED_TEXT: Duryodhana] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duryodhana] at his deathbed and promised to avenge the actions of [LINKED_TEXT: Bhima] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhima]. They attacked the Pandavas' camp later that night and killed all the Pandavas' remaining army including [LINKED_TEXT: their children] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upapandavas]. He was slaughtered in that attack. 7. Drona Dronacharya is the teacher of both Kauravas and Pandavas. He taught archery to both Arjuna & Karna and mace fight to both Bheema and Duryodana. After King [LINKED_TEXT: Drupada] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drupada] and King [LINKED_TEXT: Virata] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virata] were slain by [LINKED_TEXT: Drona] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drona], [LINKED_TEXT: Bhima] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhima], and [LINKED_TEXT: Dhristadyumna] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhristadyumna] fought him on the fifteenth day. Because Drona was very powerful and inconquerable having the irresistible brahmadanda, Krishna hinted to Yudhisthira that Drona would give up his arms if his son Ashwathama was dead. Bhima proceeded to kill an elephant named Ashwathama, and loudly proclaimed that Ashwathama was dead. Drona approached Yudhisthira to seek the truth of his son's death. Yudhisthira proclaimed Ashwathama Hatahath, naro va Kunjaro va, implying Ashwathama had died but he was nor sure whether it was a Drona's son or an elephant, The latter part of his proclamation (Naro va Kunjaro va) were drowned out by sound of the conch blown by Krishna. Drona was disheartened, and laid down his weapons. He was then killed by [LINKED_TEXT: Dhristadyumna] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhristadyumna] to avenge his father's death and satisfy his vow. 6. Abhimanyu Abhimanyu was the son of Arjuna. He heard about the strategies to enter into the Chakra Vyuha when he was in his mother's womb. On the battlefield when the four Pandavas and their allies were finding it impossible to break Dronacharya's \\"Chakra Vyuh\\" formation as Arjuna was busy fighting on the other side of the battlefield, he could not be summoned to break the [LINKED_TEXT: Chakra vyuha] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chakra_Vyuha] formation, which could only be broken by entering and exiting the formation. Yudhisthira instructed, [LINKED_TEXT: Abhimanyu] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhimanyu], one of Arjuna's sons to break the Chakra vyuha formation. Abhimanyu knew the secret of entering the Chakra vyuh formation, but did not know how to exit it. [LINKED_TEXT: Abhimanyu] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhimanyu] slew tens of thousands of warriors. He also killed Dhuryodhana's son and Durmashana who was [LINKED_TEXT: Dushasana] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dushasana]'s son. Duryodana ordered his men to attack [LINKED_TEXT: Abhimanyu] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhimanyu] all at once. [LINKED_TEXT: Abhimanyu] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhimanyu] fought but was surrounded and killed by many warriors in a combined attack. 5.Ashwathama Ashwatthama was one of the most underrated warrior of the whole Mahabharata. He had many powerful divine weapons like Narayanastra and Agneyastra. He created havoc in Pandava army after the death of his father. He was the sun of guru drona and kripi. He was a ansh of lord Shiva and becomes almost undefeated when he is angry . He was one of the few Maharathis who survived the Mahabharata war . 4. Bhishma Bhishma is the grandfather of both the Pandavas and the Kauravas. He is the most powerful warrior on the Kauravas side along with Karna. He has been the Commander-in-Chief of the Kaurava army for first 10 days of war. On the tenth day, the Pandavas, unable to withstand Bhishma's prowess, decided to put [LINKED_TEXT: Shikhandi] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikhandi], who had been a woman in a prior life in front of Bhishma, as Bhishma has taken a vow not to attack a woman. Shikhandi's arrows fell on Bhishma without hindrance. Arjuna positioned himself behind Shikhandi, protecting himself from Bhishma's attack, and aimed his arrows at the weak points in Bhishma's armour. Soon, with arrows sticking from every part of his body, the great warrior fell from his chariot. His body did not touch the ground as it was held aloft by the arrows protruding from his body. 3. Arjuna Arjuna is the third one of the Pandava brothers. The greatest warrior on the Pandavas' side. He is said to have the greatest sight, fiercest moves and perfect aim in archery. When Krishna told Arjuna and Duryodhana that he would give the Narayani Sena, to one side, and himself as a non-combatant to the other. When given the choice of either Krishna's army or Krishna Himself on their side, Arjuna on behalf of the Pandavas chose Krishna, unarmed on his own, relieving Duryodhana, who thought Arjuna to be the greatest fool. Later Arjuna requested Krishna to be his charioteer, and Krishna, being an intimate friend of Arjuna, agreed wholeheartedly, and hence received the name Parthasarthy, or 'charioteer of the son of Pritha'. Arjuna killed numerous soldiers of the Kaurava army including the greatest warriors on the Kaurava side, Bhishma and Karna. 2. Karna Karna was the first son of Kunti. But out of friendship he decided to fight alongside Duryodana in the battle. He promised Bhishma not to enter the battlefield till he was there fighting because the presence of both of them will be the end of the Pandava army. He entered Kurukshetra after Bhishma fell onto the bed of arrows. [LINKED_TEXT: Karna] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karna] defeated the Pandava brothers Nakul, Bhima, [LINKED_TEXT: Sahadeva] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahadeva] and [LINKED_TEXT: Yudhisthira] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yudhisthira] in battle but spared their lives as he swore not to kill his brothers except Arjuna. Later, Karna resumed duelling with [LINKED_TEXT: Arjuna] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arjuna]. During their duel, Karna's chariot wheel got stuck in the mud and Karna asked for a pause. Krishna reminded Arjuna about Karna's ruthlessness unto [LINKED_TEXT: Abhimanyu] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhimanyu] while he was similarly left without chariot and weapons. Hearing his son's fate, Arjuna shot his arrow and decapitated Karna. Before the day's battle, Karna's sacred armour ('Kavacha') and earrings ('Kundala') were taken as alms by Lord Indra when asked for, which resulted in his death by Arjuna's arrows. 1. Krishna Lord Krishna is considered as the eighth incarnation of Vishnu. Even though he promised not to fight in the battle, yet he is the greatest and he most powerful warrior in the whole tale of Mahabharata. If he had entered the war, then it would have ended in the blink of an eye. He acted as Arjuna's charioteer and strategist. On the ninth day Krishna, overwhelmed by anger at the apparent inability of Arjuna to defeat Bhishma, rushed towards the Kaurava commander, with the wheel of a fallen chariot in his hands. Bhishma lays down his arms and is ready to die at the hands of the Lord, but Arjuna stops Him, reminding of His promise not to wield a weapon.

Then, I woke up and searched this question to answer here. I had 5 crushes since childhood till now, I like to share those incidents with their real names. I don't want to fake it. Crush 1: Her name is Vinitha. Once , We were in Class 6 sitting in front bench , while my physics teacher is distributing exam papers ( She segregated boys and girls papers. She started distributing boys papers from last roll numbers and girls papers from first roll numbers). Luckily , my name is in second roll number and her name is in last second roll number. Meanwhile, I told her that I seen a love song where lovers see eachother 's eyes so long. Can we try this here?😀. She told “yes”. We started to look eachother eyes long time while others were surrounded our teacher. Her friend came suddenly waved her hand in between us and asked “ What's happening here”. My crush told “ Nonsense, get out of here”. We didn't got distracted till our teacher call our names to get exam papers. This is very funny incident. Years passed on, She is still in contact, but she would have forgotten this. She is nice person. Crush 2: Her name is Anila. We were in Class 8. She is topper of our class. She looks beautiful. Few boys started giving line to her but I’m the only one who thinks her as crush. One day, we were splited into groups for class presentation. I'm in her group and she is leading. I have to do chart works at home which my sister helped me out. Next day, I showed the chart work to her. She dragged me to her pulling my hand since, my voice was not audible to her. I told all my friends that she did this. I felt the touch for whole day.😀😀.😀 She is not in contact for past 6 years. Recently, I checked her Fb profile, she got married 😊. She is friendly and lovable person. Crush 3: Her name is Gowthami. We were in same department in engineering college. For our technical symposium, our seniors called us for preparing list. Myself , start doing system work which my seniors got impressed because in short time , I prepared list from large collection of data. She was near me, sitting in front of system doing same work. She stared at me for few seconds.😉 I noticed , but I ignored that because I thought that I got impressed from seniors but she didn't😀. She is my one time crush. She is not in contact for past 4 years. She is emotional and friendly person.She got married recently in this pandemic. Crush 4: Her name is Puja . We are collegues from same year of birth. We are nearby seats. I stopped talking to people too much and find hard mingling with people easily for past 11 years , I became introvert. She is talkative, so I became her good listener. Days goes on, Our collegues gossips that we are lovers. One day , one collegue asked straight to our face. We laughed for the gossips , but we felt it is a crush but never say to each other. She is emotional and friendly person 😀. Crush 5: Her name is Priyanka. We were of same age. We met eachother in random online site. We spoke a lot about our profession, our friends, the climate, our parents, our siblings and our astrology beliefs. We started knowing each other. I started inspiring her. She was waiting that I will give my WhatsApp number. I told her my whatsapp number. Later , she shared her number. She seen my pic in dp but I can't see her face in her dp. We exchanged our FB names. My motive is to see her face. Lastly, I seen her face. I told her that “ you look old than me, curiosity made me to see your face, but I can't be your perfect match”😔. She replied that “ i have the same feeling after seeing the pic but you had stick to your family's astrology beliefs that is the bitter truth”.🤐 . If I had fall in love with her , I would have proposed her inspite of the external beauty since love is blind but it doesn't happened with her before and after seeing her pic. She is still in my contact .She is bold and loyal person. I feel lovers can't be friends. Likewise, crushes can't be friends.

It’s like they are squeezing every child into a mold regardless of the child’s learning speed. Once you comprehend this issue, you realize the IQ score is meaningless as well because it is a quotient of age. When people graduate college and start their work life, age means nothing, so why is it so crucial in K-12 and why is IQ so crucial? When a child starts to fall behind, it becomes more and more difficult for them to catch up, with this effect compounding all the way to their last day of school. Children that learn slower than others (for whatever reason, sometimes chaos at home is enough of a distraction) must be given sufficient time for them to master a topic before they move on to the next topic. This approach is called the “Mastery” approach, championed by free online education resources such as Kahn Academy. Without this approach, children who have a harder time learning have a very low likelihood of going to college and succeeding in life, and a very high likelihood of dropping out of society and turning to crime and drugs. We need a sea change in the US, with modern technology we can easily switch to mastery based learning, each child going at their own best pace. You may think many children will take longer to graduate, but because they are safeguarded against the compounding effect of them falling behind, the delay in graduation for many will be less than it is now, and the educational achievement will be much higher. The current system simply can not accommodate a wide range of learning speeds, so it caters to a small range and neglects children who fall outside this range, both on the low side and the high side."},{"prompt":"What are the three components of the cell theory?","completion":"The Majority of Earth’s Oxygen Is Produced by Oceans.The Human Stomach Can Dissolve Razor Blades.Bananas are Radioactive.Animals Use Earth’s Magnetic Field to Know Their Location.Helium Works Against Gravity.Our planet has more trees compared to stars in the solar system.There is No Flavour in Food Without Saliva.Water can boil & freeze at the same time.Lights take almoGrasshoppers have ears in their belliesst eight minutes to proceed from the sun to earth.Grasshoppers have ears in their bellies.A cockroach has the ability to live for up to one week without its head.Lizards use their tongue to smell.A cloud can as heavy as a million pounds Don't forget to upvote! 👍"},{"prompt":"What is the string theory about?","completion":"All of the string theories are attempts to understand the nature of the vacuum through quantum mechanical methods, particularly with respect to the energy at a given point in that space. They are models of, and so aim to describe, a zero-dimensional point in space. The initial success of string theory was in modelling that zero-dimensional point as a 1-dimensional string - working with zero was notoriously problematic and including a degree of freedom with this single dimension gave new ‘life’ to a stalled progression. A mathematical model ensued, borne out of theory and empirical data from particle accelerators that suggested more dimensions were required to fully model the point. The critical dimension at which the mathematical model balanced was 26. And this is the number of dimensions that are thought to constitute the zero-dimensional point. Further development of the mathematics revealed a symmetry that resulted in the need for only 10 dimensions in the model. Six different string theory models emerged. The first, and essentially the 'raw data' used to establish the symmetry of the other 5 models, is the 'bosonic' string theory. It was rejected as a consistent theory on two grounds. Firstly, the theory only defines the boson and not the fermion and secondly, the theory requires and thus predicts a particle with 'imaginary' mass called a tachyon. The real instability arose when the mathematics suggested the tachyon moved faster than the speed of light. Five other string theories that identified symmetry in the mathematics, emerged. We can broadly classify these supersymmetry string theories into 2 types - types I and II - distinguished here by the use of a theoretical construct called a D-brane in the type II theories. D-branes are 2-dimensional planes upon which open strings can attach to become closed strings. More importantly, for quantum matter systems in the standard model, these plane functions map out, what is termed, a 'worldsheet' - which can loosely be interpreted as the boundary surface for the zero-dimensional point. There is a sense here, from the use of D-branes, that focus in the type II string theories is shifting from the geometric framework (which can only reveal symmetry) to a concept that considers the overlying construction to that framework. The names of the 5 string theories that use symmetry considerations are; type I, type IIA, type IIB and 2 heterotic theories, namely SO(32) and E8xE8. While each theory uses a different geometric analytical framework, each is trying to represent the same event using that framework in Euclidean space. And given that the empirical data and foundational mathematics are the same and that all the geometries 'revolve' around a central point, i.e. the origin (0,0,0....depending on the number of axes - or dimensions - passing through it), we might conclude that the models for each of the 5 consistent string theories can be aligned through their origins and geometrically transformed to one another. The standard perception of these 5 string theories is that they are all limiting cases of a unifying theory - called M-theory. Axiomatically, from the table above, the 5 string theories can be considered as identical under transformation. Those transformations come in the form of 3 mathematical tools called s-duality, t-duality and orientifolding. S-duality and t-duality are transformations to the functions representing the relationship between the quantum numbers assigned to the theories - according to their individual conceptual frameworks, i.e. the dilaton, the graviton, the radion, winding number, etc. Orientifolding, on the other hand, is a transformation that operates on the dimension-interpreting geometric framework that defines the 26 dimensions of bosonic theory and the 10 dimensions in the fermionic theories. It was recognised early in the development of the string theories that the type I theory - which uses unoriented open and closed strings - could be equated to the type IIB theory through a process called 'orientifolding'. Orientifolding can be interpreted as a 180 degree rotation of the model’s geometric framework about the central plane (perpendicular to the polar line) - effectively switching polar positions through inversion. If the model works unaffected by the transformation then the strings being modelled will be unoriented but if the inversion changes the model then the orientation of strings is important. Orientifolding the type IIB geometry changes its state from oriented to unoriented - as in the type I theory. Anomalies still existed in the type IIB after it was transformed, but these anomalies cancelled when the D-brane construct from type IIB was applied to type I. In the (reverse) transformation therefore, type I is changed from an unoriented to an oriented model through a geometric transformation that takes account of polarity - the very reason oriented strings are required - and is further changed by use of the same theoretical construct as used by the type IIB - the D-brane - closing off all open string solutions in the type I - thus equating it to type IIB. Both the type I and type IIB theories are themselves equivalent to the heterotic SO(32) and type IIB theories (i.e. type IIB is equivalent to itself), respectively, under another transformation called s-duality. S-duality is a well-established mathematical constraining tool for functions that quickly tend to infinity. The transformation is made around the line y=1. Functions that quickly move from 1 to infinity are rotated about the y=1 line, confining the function's movement to an analytical space between 1 and zero. The function, instead of spinning off into infinity, now starts at 1 and then slowly tends toward zero as x increases. The transformation changes the function f(x)=y to f(x)=1/y, but because the x-component is unaffected, a given value for y in both functions returns the same value of x in each - or conversely a given value for x returns 2 y-solutions, one in each function, that are the inverse of each other. Furthermore, for certain functions that intersect the y-axis (or start) at y=1, such as a function of the exponent e, this transformation is equivalent to another simple transformation of a rotation around the y-axis (x=0). For example, if the function of y is the exponent e raised to the power x for all x, then its path in the +x/+y quadrant of the analytical framework starts at 1 and quickly moves out to infinity. Under an s-duality transformation, the function is rotated and constrained between y=1 and y=0 in the same quadrant. The new function then becomes a reflection of that part of the original function that extends from x=0 through all negative x, i.e. the original function's movement through the -x/+y quadrant as it tends to zero. Therefore an s-duality transformation is equivalent to a simple rotation about the y-axis for a 'well-behaved' function such as y=e^x - but only for positive values of x and y. There is one more transformation - t-duality - that equates the SO(32) heterotic and type IIB theories to the heterotic E8xE8 and type IIA theories, respectively. T-duality can be interpreted as a transformation that equates the value of x with the value of y. Let’s consider the 2 forces in play for a number of string theories - the external expansive force of the local vacuum, represented by the dilaton and the internal contractive force of the string, represented by the graviton. In physical terms, we imagine that these 2 forces act so as to create oscillation in string matter systems. In the expansive phase, the dilaton is greater than the graviton and thus the strings expand. The force in the expanding string - the graviton - increases as the oscillation pulls the matter system out. Ultimately the force represented by the graviton exceeds that of the dilaton and the matter system starts to contract under that greater force. Here we see the values of the graviton and dilaton varying inversely with respect to each other. At the point of expansion the dilaton has a large value and the graviton a small one. At the point of contraction the values are reversed. However, this suggests that there is a point - somewhere in the middle - where the dilaton and the graviton are equal. Geometrically, the t-duality transformation is made around the line y=x. This means that when the 2 forces are equal, the curve representing them becomes asymptotic to the line y=x such that the single solution equality remains under the transformation. With these 3 transformations, the 5 fermionic string theories can be equated to each other, i.e. are seen to be equivalent. This is intuitive given that the geometries used revolve around a central point - the symmetry creating point of rotation - and the empirical data and the theoretical foundation are the same, and that each theory describes exactly the same entity - albeit under a different conceptual framework. Examining the table in fig.7, we see a further symmetry in the model types. As discussed, the type I and type IIB are seen as equivalent under the process of orientifolding. Applying an s-duality transformation to both equates these theories to the SO(32) heterotic and type IIB, respectively, and a t-duality transformation further equates these to the E8xE8 heterotic and type IIA theories, respectively. A clear axiomatic pathway can be seen to link all these theories. The table even suggests direct transforms exist between the 3 adjacent pairs of the type I and type II theories, e.g. the E8xE8 heterotic can be directly transformed to the type IIA theory without having to apply the 5 transforms that pass through all the other theories - though equalities such as this would require additional conceptual alignment. There exists one other duality that we have not yet mentioned - u-duality. This duality relates the s-duality to the t-duality. We can interpret this duality as one that recognises that quantum numbers under different theories with different concepts are in fact the same. For example, the dilaton is considered ‘parallel’ to the radion. So, even though extended theoretical development of the tachyon showed it to 'condense' - indicating its matter potential, and further, providing a basis for the Higgs mechanism which is needed in the standard model to describe the formation of matter from pure energy in the early universe - the bosonic theory was considered deeply flawed by its presence and the lack of an identifiable fermion. The two types of string theory that emerged after the bosonic theory included different concepts for the fermion. The type I included the fermion as a closed string with the boson represented by an open string, whereas the type II theories introduced a 'mass-less' fermion - a concept inconsistent with standard theory yet perfectly describing the tachyon. The heterotic string theories are hybridised bosonic/fermionic theories that use only closed strings. When a string's vibration moved in one direction it was considered to have a bosonic field, when it moved in the opposite direction it was considered to have a fermionic field. Left and right states exist in all the superstring theories - it is the basis of their symmetry - and many physicists remain convinced that these symmetry considerations will unveil the true nature of space, to the extent that a further theory - M-theory - was developed. M-theory is at the forefront of string theory development and is proposed as an all-encompassing theory that includes the 5 string theories as limiting cases. It is closely related to the E8xE8 heterotic and the type IIA theories. The theory is as yet incomplete and not fully understood, or developed, but physicists are of the belief that this next step in string theory development will be the last. This belief is predicated on symmetry considerations that predict a whole host of new 'supersymmetric' partners of every known particle. In effect, the supersymmetry theories maintain that for every known fermion there is a boson 'superpartner' and likewise for every boson there is a fermion superpartner. This is clearly an extension of the concept that the same particle can be fermionic in one direction and bosonic in the other. None of these superpartner particles have ever been found in particle experiments. http://therdanalogy.atwebpages.com/String/String01.html"},{"prompt":"What is a dofollow backlink?","completion":"[LINKED_TEXT: Comment Backlinks – Does It Work For SEO] [URL: https://updatetheory.com/comment-backlinks/] [LINKED_TEXT: Why would we do that and what are the benefits?] [URL: https://updatetheory.com/comment-backlinks/] Comment backlinks we can do for a lot of work and inside it can be that where we keep the backlinks in the comments, many visitors come who read the comments and top the back linked comments then they will enter the backlinked website.

Thanks for this question! Actually, Improving productivity can be a challenging task, but there are several unique tips and tricks you can try to enhance your efficiency and effectiveness. Here are some suggestions: 1. Implement the Two-Minute Rule: If a task takes less than two minutes to complete, do it immediately instead of postponing it. This helps prevent small tasks from piling up and becoming a burden. 2. Practice the Pomodoro Technique: Break your work into 25-minute intervals (pomodoros) with short breaks in between. After completing four pomodoros, take a longer break. This method helps maintain focus and prevents burnout. 3. Use the Eisenhower Matrix: Prioritize tasks using this matrix, which classifies them into four categories: Urgent and Important, Important but Not Urgent, Urgent but Not Important, and Not Urgent or Important. Focus on tasks that fall into the first category. 4. Leverage the Power of Habit Stacking: Attach a new habit you want to form to an existing habit. For example, if you want to read more, make it a habit to read a few pages after brushing your teeth every night. 5. Try Time Blocking: Schedule specific blocks of time for different activities or tasks throughout your day. This helps create a structured routine and minimizes distractions. 6. Optimize Your Environment: Create a workspace that is clean, organized, and free from distractions. Minimize clutter and personalize your space to make it conducive to productivity. 7. Practice Mindfulness and Meditation: Take short breaks during the day to engage in mindfulness exercises or meditation. This can help clear your mind, reduce stress, and improve focus. 8. Use Productivity Apps and Tools: Explore various productivity apps and tools available for task management, note-taking, time tracking, and project collaboration. Find the ones that work best for your workflow and incorporate them into your routine. 9. Focus on Single-Tasking: Multitasking can often lead to decreased productivity and increased errors. Instead, concentrate on one task at a time, giving it your full attention before moving on to the next. 10. Incorporate Regular Exercise and Breaks: Physical activity and regular breaks throughout the day can boost your energy levels and overall productivity. Take short walks, stretch, or engage in quick exercises to refresh your mind and body. Remember that different techniques work for different people, so it's essential to experiment and find the strategies that resonate with you.

Absolutely nothing is preventing us from becoming the science fiction world that many movies (and books!) predicted. However. There are many things preventing us from realizing that we are currently living inside a science fiction world: Historical perspective and the advancement of science When most people think about scientific evolution, they usually picture a neat technological tree a la Civilization videogame like this: Certainly, we humans needed to invent the wheel before landing rockets in the Moon. From our historical vantage point of view, it all seems logical, neat and tidy. The problem is, that people in the past, and scientists in our present doesn’t have a neat technological tree to guide them towards future discoveries and their prequisites. Science progression is messy and prone to trial and error. We go blind into the future. We often stumble into several unexpected roadblocks that we could not foresee before, like Einstein’s relativity and his pesky speed limits that prevent us from reaching faster than light travel. That makes some technologies advance way slower than we thought (space travel comes to mind), while some of them advance way faster than we could ever imagine (like computers). Consequently, science advancement tends to go way slower than what many techno-optimists would like. That mismatch between expectations and results are a bit of a party pooper, but there are more factors in play here. Lack of historical perspective and the triumph of the anti-progress narrative Our current social undercurrent is dominated by post modernism, and one of its cornerstones is the rejection of the values of enlightment, chiefly, the notion of human progress. Consequently, every single scientific advancement needs to be minimized and ignored (or better: demonized), or else our precious post modern narrative of “everything is relative, there is nothing better nor worse”, could be jeopardized. Hence the rise of anti-scientific movements like the anti-vaxxers or the flat earthers. We really need to believe that mankind have not progressed, and that our magnificent scientific advancements are for naught, and that everything is worse than ever, that technology and industrial society is leading us to our destruction, hence why a lot of anti progress prophets of doom selectively embrace the science behind climate change. The problem is that this narrative is patently false, and based in the nihilistic, minds of the people that expouses it, than in any trace of external reality. Because we are not living on a sci fi world. We have in many regards, surpassed what science fiction promised. Does this looks futuristic enough to you?

However, the prophets of doom have a great ally thanks to: Lack of social advancement The advancement of technology doesn’t mean that its gains are evenly distributed among society. You can have a highly technological society with crappy ethics and opressive social structures. Which is the problem here. Science might cure cancer someday, but it sure won’t cure assholes nor corrupt leaders. Scientific advances can be misused. And progress not only applies to science, but to societies as well. And let be honest with ourselves: Our societies are not more fair nor enlightened than decades ago, and the western democracies haven’t had an exactly stellar record at improving our countries in the latest century. And yet, I would take our world of imperfect democracies and cronist politicians over the murderous madness of war-torn early XXth century, thank you very much. So here we are.

Ultron is already violating rules established in other, more canonical MCU shows. The Infinity Gems Ultron is using should not function outside of their own native Universe. This was well established in the Loki series. They certainly should not function in a space such as that of The Watcher, who is outside of the Multiverse. Next, we might point out that it was only through knowledge of the secrets of the Eye of Agamotto that Dr. Strange was able to survive Dormomu's attacks and ultimately defeat him. Ultron is not so well versed and depended on Thanos just handing him all of the stones. Speaking of the stones, the What If? story is also ignoring that the stones are treacherous in their own right. The space stone sent the Red Skull to Vormir and the assembled stones injured anyone who used the gauntlet to “make a wish\\". So, really, the stones aught to have been taking some kind of toll on Ultron. Granted, this is all for a specifically non-canon cartoon, so it's fine that the What If ? Series plays around.

Borrowing liberally from War of the Worlds, Aliens, and every sci-fi invasion film inbetween, director Roland Emmerich and producer and co-writer Dean Devlin present a visually slick, fast-paced adventure filled with expensive special effects and large-scale action sequences. The story begins with the approach of a series of massive spaceships, which many on Earth greet with open arms, looking forward to the first contact with alien life. Unfortunately, these extraterrestrials have not come in peace, and they unleash powerful weapons that destroy most of the world's major cities. Thrown into chaos, the survivors struggle to band together and put up a last-ditch resistance in order to save the human race. As this is a Hollywood film, this effort is led by a group of scrappy Americans, including a computer genius who had foreseen the alien's evil intent (Jeff Goldblum), a hot-shot jet pilot (Will Smith), and the President of the United States (Bill Pullman). While some critics objected to the film's lack of originality and lapses in logic, the combination of grand visual spectacle and crowd-pleasing storytelling proved irresistible to audiences, resulting in an international smash hit.

Here are a few possible reasons: Exceptional Service: If the restaurant staff provided exceptional service, going above and beyond expectations, a customer may feel inclined to show appreciation by leaving a generous tip.Outstanding Food: If the food quality, taste, and presentation were exceptional, it may motivate a customer to leave a larger tip as a way of expressing their satisfaction.Special Occasion: Celebratory events like birthdays, anniversaries, or achievements may prompt individuals to leave a generous tip as a way to enhance the overall experience and create a memorable moment.Gratitude for Recommendations: If the restaurant staff provided helpful recommendations, such as suggesting unique dishes or pairing options, a customer may choose to show gratitude through a larger tip.Recognition of Hard Work: Leaving a generous tip can be a way to acknowledge and appreciate the hard work and dedication of the restaurant staff, recognizing the challenges they face in the service industry.Paying It Forward: Some individuals may have the means and desire to spread positivity and make a difference in someone else's day by leaving a larger tip, helping the restaurant staff financially. It's important to note that tipping practices vary across cultures and countries. The reasons for leaving a tremendous tip can be subjective and vary from person to person based on their personal values, experiences, and appreciation for the service they received."},{"prompt":"Do you have a different opinion on climate change?","completion":"There is an actively promoted notion that the human activity vastly influences the level of carbon dioxide production into the atmosphere. However, according to accessible data, there is 800 years lag in CO2 after temperature. CO2 causing climate change is actually the other way around. People produce the smallest amount of CO2, while nature is the main source of all, with oceans being the biggest influencers. The warmer oceans, the more CO2 they produce. Oceans are so big they take long time to warm up and cool down, so it explains the lag of 800 years. The current warming was caused way earlier than the present times. The reduced production of carbon dioxide by humans did not decrease the level of CO2 in the atmosphere. This was proven in 2008 during the global crisis and in 2020 during the COVID-19."},{"prompt":"What genetic malformation does Megan Fox have?","completion":"Megan Fox has what’s called ‘toe thumbs.’ Brachydactyly is an inherited trait that results in shorter bones in the fingers and/or toes"},{"prompt":"My family wants to put my cat down.

Will they be viewed as weak? Stupid? Foolish?That no one will love them again because they are “too damaged,” or “not good enough.” That they’re “not strong enough.” Deciding to leave an abuser is most definitely an empowered choice. However, choosing to leave an abuser is not about whether or not someone is strong enough. There are plenty of \\"strong people” who still end up suffering from abuse. Hope (Love) That the abuse will go away.That the person will/can change.That they can rescue their abuser. People try to convince themselves (and sometimes others) that their abuser will change. Many times, the victim believes that this change is dependent on how well they love their abuser. They start thinking things like, “If I can just love him/her enough/more, I know they’ll be different.” They may minimize the abuse, telling themselves that, “It’s not that bad,” or “It only happens a few times a year.” What is more, the victim may point to some progress their abuser has made, or to their abuser’s positive qualities. For instance, perhaps their abuser is a good provider or successful or dependable. Because of this, they may ignore the budding “red flags” (especially in the beginning) and hope that things will be different with enough time and with enough love. In a real sense, they put themselves in a “rescuer” role, believing that they can “fix” their abuser. While this comes from a good place—a place of steadfast love and a true desire to help—it is extremely imbalanced and misguided. If you were to compare this to an addiction to drugs or alcohol, for example, a person who is struggling with addiction will not just magically stop given the right prescription of love. Instead, that person has to want to change, and no amount of hope or love will suffice—true change is not forced."},{"prompt":"Who is headless CMS for?","completion":"CMS in its usual sense combines the content and appearance of the website. Most monolithic systems are \\"linked\\". That is, CMA and CDA are being combined. In the past few years, we have seen an increase in the number of systems that try to be more flexible in their way of delivering content. The decoupled CMS does not contain it, does not deal with views, templates, structure, or design of the site. It does not associate content with a specific output (such as rendering a web page) but provides it as data via an API. The concept allows you to attract customers through multiple channels with personalized content. Headless architecture is reactive, so it stays idle until a request is sent to the content. The structure is really flexible, content is treated as data, and designers work in specially adapted environments in real-time. [LINKED_TEXT: Headless Drupal commerce] [URL: https://anyforsoft.com/blog/drupal-commerce-new-features/] is extremely agile offering a variety of options to deliver a better user experience. A headless website has a separate interface connected via an API. Drupal can be decoupled in two ways: 1. Progressively You can use the Drupal rendering system with the simultaneous use of javascript frameworks (React and Angular). For developers, this approach is about decoupling a js framework-based page, maintaining the speed and unlocked assemblers. And for designers, there are contextualized interfaces, content workflow, previews, and other features available. 2. Fully This is when the frontend and backend are fully decoupled, replacing the branch theme layer with another frontend technology. In this case, front and back are located in different domains/subdomains and may well be considered different applications."},{"prompt":"Why did Mr. Awdhesh Singh choose civil services over engineering services?","completion":"There were many reasons for choosing civil services over engineering services. Let me start from the beginning. I followed the rat race when I was in my Intermediate (10+2). Since everyone was writing for IIT-JEE, I too did the same, and I was selected in it due to my score in the IIT-JEE. However, after joining IIT-BHU (Then IT-BHU), I realized that I did not like engineering subjects. I always loved maths and physics upto 10+2, but I never liked engineering during my B Tech. Mechanical Engineering was too boring and dull for me. There was no scope of creativity and application of intelligence to solve complex problems. If you have a great memory, you can get the top rank in the class. Most of our studies were done just before the exams and we forgot almost everything once the exams were over. Since I never liked Engineering, I also never scored well during exams. I was just an average student in my class having rank of around 25-30 in the class of 52. After my B Tech, I joined Larsen and Toubro (L&T), which was ‘the’ engineering company during our time and it used to be the dream job of half of the IIT Bombay students then. I worked there for almost one year. I, however, realized that the job of an engineer in a company like L&T was very monotonous. You were doing exactly the same thing over and over again for months and years. I decided to quit the job as I found that it did not suit me. When I left L&T and joined M Tech in IIT Delhi, I had made up my mind that I would either be a Civil Servant or a Professor by doing M Tech + PhD. Since I was no good at Engineering (Mechanical Engineering), I decided to drop this as an option and choose Maths + Physics (Two optional required during those days). Fortunately, I got into IRS in the first attempt itself. I worked as a civil servant (IRS officer) for 25 years and loved my job. However, I am now pursuing my second passion i.e. to become a writer and educator after taking VRS from Government.

And how do you move on in everyday life?","completion":"How? With the help of Al-Anon, or any other spiritual program, I learned to detach from disruptive situations involving a narcissist by using the slogan “you didn’t cause it, you can’t control it, and you can’t cure it”, so over many years, I learned to live the “walk the talk” principle until it became hard-wired. This can take a very long time to achieve, and instant results are not possible nor sustainable. In this way, the trauma bond is disengaged because you focus on yourself and not the narcissist nor on the relationship, and you now have agency separate from what the narcissist does or doesn’t do. You walked away from the “game” and you’re not playing any more. You will eventually notice that your disengagement feels better than the relationship itself, and you will make better choices in your life. In “everyday life”, you move on by avoiding people and situations whose dysfunction will only cause you pain. Your radar has been re-tuned to pick up the potential for bad outcomes in people you used to think were “exciting”. You accept your dismissal of the relationship no matter how many other narcissistic relationships you can observe and think they are “successful”. You are able to feel with your heart, and not just think with your brain, that such a relationship will not work for you or anyone else, and you can see the distress and confusion on the horizon, so you are not interested. If you want to summon your “inner child”, you know that you would never subject any child to this abuse, so why is it OK for you? The trauma bond is released when you decide that the pain of narcissistic abuse is greater than the anxiety and uncertainty of being alone or building another relationship."},{"prompt":"Aren’t you upset seeing a tattoo all over Jungkook’s arm?","completion":"Upset?

Grab some shoes, and you’re ready to go! But that doesn’t mean it’s easy. In fact, there are four mistakes I see new runners making over and over. Going too hard, too soon. If you haven’t been running on a regular basis, start by using run–walk intervals to safely take you from walking the distance to running the distance. Pro Tip: Not sure how to safely progress? Enter your email and I’ll send over my free walk to 5k plan After, you’ve built up for a few months, be sure to run frequently to make it a habit, then a lifestyle. How frequently? Well it really depends on your goals. If your goal is to run three miles at the same pace for general fitness purposes, your run frequency target will look much different than someone training to PR their marathon. Even if you don’t care about times or performance, you should plan to run at least three times a week. Look at it this way. If you only run one to two times a week, you may never improve much, enjoy running, or experience many of the other benefits “they” talk about (like a runner’s high).

The entire film is very beautifully crafted. It is not at all a candy floss rom-com by Dharma Production, but a totally realistic self realization story of a rich spoilt kid who had no ambitions or goals in life, who finally finds out his passion, and grows up to be a man. Plus lots more! Although, almost every scene is a favourite of mine, here are some thoughts about the climax of Wake Up Sid! Sid returns home after spending months with Aisha in her apartment, after he decided to leave home after having an argument with him over his failing college! Aisha, an aspiring writer fell in love with Sid, and realized that somewhat earlier. As her article comes up on 'Mumbai Beats' magazine, and Sid starts reading it, he soon realized what Aisha means, and then the 'rain' scene happens. The next scene that depicts both at their own locations enjoying the rain is epic, it is an amalgamation of realization stimulated by rain and along with the beautiful song 'Boondon ke moti' is just awesome. Sid knew exactly where to find Aisha, and there he confesses his love for her, with Mumbai skyline in the background, and the monsoon! The climax, although cannot boast of a twist, it is perfect for a film of that genre. And, only when one watches the film he will know the true significance of the scene. The first time I watched the film, I watched this last scene over and over about 25 times or so. Of course the film teaches us a lot more:It clearly depicts a part of the life of the rich kid, Siddharth Malhotra, someone who had no ambition or goal in life, the importance of friends in his life, the parental pressure and how eventually he fails in the finals of his college and how his life changes after that!Overall a great watch, hats off to Ayan Mukherji."},{"prompt":"Republicans say democrats are trying to turn kids gay, but aren’t they trying to turn gay kids straight with conversion camps?","completion":"Since homosexuality is a choice, conversion camp only gives them their choices.

I am from Thane, so regularly go to Mumbai for one or the other thing. Earlier i used to think that Mumbai is most expensive city in everything. But then i lived in Bangalore for a month and have been to Delhi as well. And the cost of commute in Mumbai is really damn low compared to other big cities. First of all we have the mighty Locals! 10 rs, and you are half way across the city. Also you'll get sharing rickshaw on almost all busy routes. BEST buses are always there for your rescue. In Bangalore, as there is no meter system, rickshaw wallas will demnad anything they can think of and you cant do anything about it. And with upcoming 3 metro lines in Mumbai, travel's gonna be cheaper and convenient. Airport is right there in the city so bye bye expensive cabs. Also you'll get trains to almost all the states from Mumbai so you dont need to travel to other cities for that. I hardly use Ola or Uber in this city and rickshaws are like once in a month thing!

Which one should be read first or last? Why?","completion":"Which gospel that should be read first depends on what you want to know about Jesus and His time here on earth. Matthew was written by a Jew for the Jews portraying Jesus as the rightful heir to the throne of Judah. He is the face of the Lion, the king of the beasts, as pictured in the vision of the four faced beast in Ezekiel and Revelation’s throne of God vision. In order to prove He is the rightful heir (king), His genealogy is traced back to Abraham only in this gospel. It is also the only gospel to mention the kingdom of heaven, or Jesus’ coming millennium rule as king, whereas Mark and Luke only mention the kingdom of God that comes after the millennium. Here too is the only place that mentions the 3 magi visiting the baby Jesus to honor this future king and Harod attempting to kill this future king with his ‘slaughter of the innocents’ attempt. Mark was written by a Roman to the Romans portraying Jesus as the perfect servant. There is more action in Mark than the other gospels because the Romans preferred action over words. As the face of the Ox or cherubim in the four faced beast, Jesus reminds us there is more glory in serving than being served or honored. His sacrifice on behalf of mankind on the cross was the ultimate proof of Him being the perfect servant. Luke was written by a Greek to the Greeks, represented Jesus as the perfect man, because the Greeks idealized the perfect man. His genealogy goes back to Adam to prove He was of the race of Adam. Only by being of the race of Adam could He redeem that race by way of His sacrificial blood and prove He was that perfect man. Also only in this gospel, is the story of Mary and Joseph where her virgin birth of the ‘man’ Jesus is emphasized. John was written by a Christian to the Christians portraying Jesus as the Word, or God. With the face of the eagle in the four faced beast, as the highest flying creature He is above His creation. In John we see that most of Jesus’ discussions are with the religious leaders, and it is only in John that Jesus calls Himself the I AM."},{"prompt":"Who is your favourite character from all of the Middle Earth lore and why?","completion":"Easy peesy. WITHOUT A HEARTBEAT. SARUMAN THE WHITE. I just love the guy. In the movie he is shown as kind of a crazy man, but I will go from both movie and book. #1) He played his own game. He was sent down to help the people of Middle-earth. If you’re gonna be a wizard hero, then why not do it in… STYLE?! :DThat is what he did. Hell, he had a small country to himself! He was living in Orthanc. Fricking Orthanc. Made from the same black stone of which the walls of Minas Tirith were made of. Can you believe it?! This guy was personally residing in a nice little tower, which was a MINI EQUAL of the greatest fortress made by man in Middle-earth! Sent as a powerful wizard? Then why not be the MOST powerful? Also Saruman. ‘but gaaaandalf was the most powerful, not Saruman’. Yeeeees… but not really. Saruman was the strongest wizard, lore-wise. Gandalf died and came back as “Saruman SHOULD have been” so he was basically Saruman+Gandalf, which is going to always be the stronger than just Saruman or Just Gandalf. Now. Things not going your way? Why not make an alliance with the ultimate Dark Lord? Always a good fallback if Sauron would have won, Saruman would have been sipping wine and smoking pipeweed from the balcony of orthanc and wave to the Nazgul as they fly by. No biggie. Now. You feeling kinda bored? I don’t think people realize JUST HOW CRAZY Saruman the white was. In the best way possible. The guy turned his little flower-tower into the little-brother equivalent of Barad-dur! He massed together an army which won Helms Deep, (if not for Gandalf and a thousand other Rohirrim riding in from behind) He made the biggest leaps in technology in probably all of Middle-earth, creating the ‘flame of orthanc’ which would make C4 drool. And then he attacked the second strongest faction of men in the world! With an army he made from 0 to 100 in a MONTH! A MONTH! So here we have a guy who pushed, beat, pulled, and broke every single law everyone else was following. This guy didn’t have a limit. AAANNNNDD. He was NOT evil, no matter how much he was portrayed in the movie… Saruman made an alliance with Sauron because he KNEW Sauron would win. There was a .5% to 99.5% that Sauron would win. And, Saruman did whatever any normal person would do. He said ‘alrighty, lets make an alliance! I’m betting on you to win, and when you do, we be besties, alrighty?” But Saruman was going to ‘betray’ Sauron! He was going to be his ally, yes. He would perhaps work for him, but look at this. Saruman made an alliance so that he could keep the seed of rebellion. He would have kept an alliance with some survivors, in secret he would have forged a rebellion, he would rise up with his armies of Orthanc and crushed the armmies of Mordor off-guard! And, while this would be getting built up, Sauron would very likely give him the lands of Rohan and the Wold, (which would be like, at LEAST 10x the land Saruman possesed) AND Saruman would have probably talked the hill-men of Dunland to pledge themselves to Sauron, and he personally would let them keep their land, and, owning Rohan, would probably give it to him. Thus, getting the favor of Dunland, THUS, Getting most of Dunland on HIS side if, oh, I don’t know, a WAR would break out sometime? Hmm? Just an idea… So, in my eyes, Saruman was a total beast. Nobody else in my eyes sits close to him. He’s on top of the pyramid, second to none. Honorable mentions: Boromir, Bilbo Baggins, Thorin + Co. and Smaug. otherwise, hope this helped!

Are you going to be using the software from a mobile device? Do you need the lowest cost option, or are you willing to pay more for a specific premium feature? Is it important to have software that can handle specific needs for your business? Or will a general accounting package work just fine? However specific your needs, there are a number of choices of accounting software packages. Asking the right questions about your needs can help eliminate programs from consideration that won’t do you any good. For example, if you need a mobile-ready, Mac compatible program for your [LINKED_TEXT: electrical contracting business] [URL: https://www.fieldpulse.com/electrician] of five employees, you can save yourself time from sorting through all those programs that are Windows-only, meant for larger businesses, and don’t include mobile apps.

These integrations extend the core accounting functionality by allowing them to offer new features, like [LINKED_TEXT: timesheets, job costing, team scheduling] [URL: https://www.fieldpulse.com/contractor] and more.

There are three different levels of pricing from 9 a month (Starter) to 30 (Standard for up to 5 users) to 70 at the Premium level, which includes unlimited invoicing and multiple currencies. The Premium tier allows you to add more users at 2 per person per month (which can really add up for larger companies). But, for smaller companies who work internationally, they offer accounting options and flexibility that is hard to find with other accounting packages. Xero also has a variety of partners to provide direct banks feeds and integrated financial services. In addition to the competitive pricing, they offer a free trial for the first month. The Jonas Corporation One popular program for construction-specific companies is the [LINKED_TEXT: Jonas Premier Cloud Construction Software] [URL: http://jonaspremier.com/].

Sage has some nice features, including automatic sales tax calculations and project-based reporting. But it lacks some standard options, like purchase orders. They are in the early stages of offering cloud-based services, but as with other companies, expect their cloud services to grow. Their pricing includes a basic version for 10 per month and their full accounting program for 25 per month. ZipBooks If you’re looking for a free option to get started, [LINKED_TEXT: ZipBooks] [URL: https://zipbooks.com/] is a great starting point. The free tier won’t match what’s offered with their paid program, or the other options on this list. However, it does allow you to keep track of the basics.

This makes ZipBooks another option for growing with your business.

It's important to note that spot reduction of fat in specific areas, including the face, is not possible. However, by following these general guidelines, you may be able to achieve a slimmer face over time: Maintain a Caloric Deficit: To lose weight overall, including in the face, you need to create a caloric deficit by consuming fewer calories than you burn. Focus on a balanced diet that is rich in whole foods, including fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats. Limit your intake of processed foods, sugary snacks, and beverages.Regular Cardiovascular Exercise: Engaging in regular cardiovascular exercises, such as brisk walking, running, cycling, or swimming, can help burn calories and contribute to overall weight loss. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week.Strength Training: Incorporate strength training exercises into your routine to build muscle mass. Increased muscle mass can help boost your metabolism and contribute to a more toned appearance. Consider exercises that target the muscles in your face and neck, such as facial yoga or resistance exercises.Facial Exercises: Facial exercises may help tone the muscles in your face and reduce puffiness. Some examples include chin lifts, cheek puff exercises, and jawline exercises. While the effectiveness of facial exercises in reducing face fat is not scientifically proven, they may help improve muscle tone and definition.Stay Hydrated: Drinking an adequate amount of water can help keep your body hydrated, maintain overall health, and reduce bloating. Aim to drink at least eight glasses of water per day.Limit Sodium Intake: Excessive sodium consumption can contribute to water retention and bloating. Be mindful of your sodium intake by avoiding high-sodium processed foods and reducing the amount of salt you add to your meals.Get Sufficient Sleep: Inadequate sleep can contribute to fluid retention and puffiness in the face. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night to support overall health and reduce facial bloating.Manage Stress: High stress levels can lead to weight gain and fluid retention. Practice stress management techniques such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, yoga, or engaging in activities you enjoy to help reduce stress.Be Patient: It's important to note that changes in facial fat may take time and vary from person to person. Focus on overall health, weight loss, and adopting a healthy lifestyle rather than solely targeting face fat reduction. Remember to consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian before making any significant changes to your diet or exercise routine, particularly if you have any underlying health conditions.

Any parent knows how little kids don’t like being told “no,” or holding our hands in parking lots, sometimes giving difficulty about being in their carseat, etc. But finally with my youngest child, I found that by framing what I say differently, I get very little pushback in those situations. Walking in a parking lot? “I’m going to hold your hand to keep you safe.” Getting them strapped into the carseat? “I’m buckling you in to keep you safe.” Moving something dangerous out of reach? “I’m putting this away to keep you safe.” So it’s a positive statement about what I’m doing (not what my child should or shouldn’t be doing), and also a way to connect and show it’s out of love for them. It can be used in other forms as well: With food: “I’m serving you this healthy snack (instead of whatever junk food they are whining for) because I want you to get big and strong.” With bedtime: “I’m turning out the lights because I want you to get a good night’s rest, so you have energy to play with your friends at school tomorrow.” Seriously, try this if you have little ones!

Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda, Namibia, Botswana, South Africa, and so many others. What else do you like? Whatever you are interested in on the continent, there are many countries who are safe for you. Just do your research and go for it. Meet wonderful people, learn about their cultures, and their beautiful lands and countries. As far as safety is concerned, below are some countries I would stay away from. I do not negotiate with my safety. If you are hesitating, you should not go. Africa is big and there are so many choices for you and your friends. Keep in mind, this list might change at some point. As of July 2018, I would not call the following countries safe at all. I would not recommend you to go there. If I can’t go, I won’t recommend anybody to go. Unless, you know for sure where you will be going. Somalia ( Based on Al Shabab).Libya ( Libya is not the same without Mr. Gaddafi).South Soudan ( New country with some political issues).Republic of Central Africa ( Based on UN peaceful mission troops there).Northern Part of Cameroun ( Some politics between French and English speaking Cameroun). The French part is quite safe.Whatever regions where Boko Haram is located ( parts of Nigeria in the North and elsewhere). They are quite unpredictable, so I am not taking the chance. Some people might add a few countries, depending on their circumstances. Selected parts of Mali, Niger, and Tchad.Eastern part of Democratic Republic of Congo. There are still rebel groups in some remote areas. Those areas are very unsafe.In December, 2017, Although I visited Bukavu, the largest city in Eastern DRC, I would not recommend it. The presidential elections are around the corner in DRC and things don’t look too good there. President Kabila does not want to go. However, the Congolese people clearly don’t want him no more. The only reason I visited there, was because I lived in DRC for three years and still have family who live there. In a way, I was taken care of there. My fiancee and soon to be wife is Rwandan-Congolese.As a Rwandan, I would add Burundi on this list. The politics there are not good at all. Regardless of how conservative you are, there are going to be over 40–45 out of 55 countries who are very safe. In many cases, if you are traveling for the first time, I would focus on doing your research before going as well as maintaining situational awareness wherever you are going. Medication. I am African, so I am used to mosquitoes and don’t bring anti-malaria pills with me. However, many people learn the hard way that our weather and climate is just different. In my work in Ghana, we used to get a medical kit with Malarone and other first aid stuff. Definitely, do not forget anti-malaria pills. Presidential Elections. If you are going to a country and their past two presidential elections have not been peaceful to your standards, I would be very careful to go there. Be aware and keep that in mind as you prepare your travels. For example, countries such as Kenya, Burkinafaso, Togo, Gabon, and a few more others are very peaceful today. However, I would be very careful to go there in presidential times. Kenya has been like that for while.Burkinafaso was transitioning from a 25 year rule with Blaise Compaore. It is clear the Burkinabe people did not like him. It was ugly when they finally reversed him from power. Today, the new president, Christian Kabore, looks promising.Togo and Gabon have been lead by one man or family for a while now. When I talk to people from those countries, they explain me there is always uncertainity during presidential elections. After elections, things usually take a few months to get back to normal. At the moment, these four countries a “GO” by my standards.

Just like Paris ( France) and Prague ( Czech Republic), pickpocketing is a big issue in big cities in many African countries. If you are a first time traveler, be vigilent for your cell phones and electronics. In fact, since we are talking about safety, this is what you should worry about first. Nobody knows you there to harm you. If anything, the thieves are after your money and electronics. The Do’s and the Dont’s. It is your responsibility to be a good tourist. Learn what to do and not to do. Traveling is expensive and you do not want to ruin your experience over somethings you should have known. In each country, their ways of doing things might be different from yours, so adjust yourself accordingly. For example, I would not visit any of the Muslim countries during Ramadan. Why? Because depending on where you are going, businesses and major attractions might be closed or open for short hours. If you can anticipate situations like these, you are going to save yourself some headaches. Those who have read my answers before know that I am not a big fan of big cities. Unless, I am there for the purpose of working or other business trips. I try to stay away. I do not like to hustle in metropolitican cities when I am on vacation. I personally like to go to the islands in coastal areas, safaris, and other natural beauties that countries have to offer. More hints about navigating through big cities. Big cities are known to be the worst at scamming 1st time tourists. Large cities such as Abuja, Johannesburg, Lagos, and similar others. Wherever you are about to go, do some research on what to expect. Travel smart and be aware. Talking to random strangers ( in some parts of Johannesburg) might not a good idea. Nobody is about to sell you some gold or diamond. Stay away from strangers you don’t know. I would not buy anything on the streets if you are not familiar with the area. Be a good traveler and be aware of your surroundings in the busy cities. I can’t stand traffic jams in big cities. This is why I stay away from the metropolitan cities. I can manage with average-medium size cities better. All in all, it is really worth it. There is no place like Africa. You will find some of the friendliest and hospitable people in Africa. We love to share our cultures, dances, songs, and many other unique traditions. This is me at the King’s palace in Rwanda. How we used to do it back in ancient times.

If it is your first time in North Africa, maybe I should not recommend Tunisia for you. However, the tourism industry is booming again ( after Arab Spring).

I think people must smuggle food home in their bags too."},{"prompt":"Social Science","completion":"More than sixty years ago, the British scientist and novelist C. P. Snow delivered the Rede Lecture (University of Cambridge) on “The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution.” The two cultures that he was referring to were scientific culture and literary-humanist culture. His contention was that since the 19th century, there had developed a gulf between the two cultures which had led to a breakdown in communications between them and that this breakdown in communications was at the root of many of the problems besetting modern society. One issue that he did not address in that lecture was the status of the social sciences. The social sciences would seem to stand somewhere intermediate between the natural sciences and the humanities. As it turns out, the kind of division that Snow perceived to exist within modern culture between scientific culture and literary-humanist culture seems to exist within the social sciences themselves. There are many social scientists that tend to identify with what Snow had called scientific culture. And at the same time, there are many other social scientists who tend to identify more with literary-humanist culture. Those social scientists who identify with scientific culture, I would call positivists, while those social scientists who identify more with literary-humanist culture, I would call antipositivists. This split within the social sciences has existed for a long time, certainly since the early 19th century. And positivist/antipositivist debates have been going on in the social science for quite some time. One curious aspect of the positivist/antipositivist debates within the social sciences is that they seem to cut across not just the boundaries that exist between different social sciences but also across all sorts of ideological and theoretical differences that exist within the social sciences. The term, positivism, is one that has been widely bandied about in both the social sciences and the humanities. It is not always clear as to what is being referred to. So, before going further with this discussion it might be useful to keep in mind the typology of positivism that Russell Keat proposed in his 1981 book The Politics of Social Theory. There, he provided the following typology of positivist theses in social theory: 1). The 'scientist' thesis which asserts that science alone represents genuine forms of human knowledge. And by science he was referring to the natural sciences. Thus, legitimate human knowledge would be said to include the natural sciences plus any other disciplines that are modeled more or less on the natural sciences. 2). The positivist conception of science which holds that science aims at the explanation and prediction of observable phenomena by treating them as instances of universal natural laws. That is what Carl Hempel referred to as the covering-law model of scientific explanation is adhered to. The scientific validity of statements describing natural laws is assessed solely in terms of their logical relationships to other statements describing observation data. The positivist conception of science was developed over the years by such thinkers as Berkeley, Hume, Comte, J. S. Mill, Ernst Mach, and in the last century, by the logical positivists including Moritz Schlick, Rudolf Carnap, Herbert Feigl, Hans Reichenbach and Philipp Frank among others. And returning to Comte, it should be noted that he was the creator of both Positivism as a philosophy and of sociology as a distinct discipline, intended to be the positive science of society. 3). The advocacy of a scientific politics, that is the idea that science can provide rational solutions to all problems concerning the organization of society and that such decisions can be freed from nonscientific influences. This view can be traced back to Lord Bacon. In the 19th century, Henri de Saint-Simon and Auguste Comte were very notable exponents of scientific politics, and in the 20th and 21st centuries there have been a host of thinkers who have subscribed to it as well, mostly as defenders of some form of technocracy. 4). The doctrine of value-freedom, which is the doctrine that it is both possible and necessary to separate out the realm of science from the realms of moral and political values. The validity of scientific theories does not depend on the acceptance or rejection of any particular moral or political commitments. Science is therefore 'value-free.' This doctrine can be found the writings of Hume, Kant and Mill but its greatest exponent in the social sciences was probably Max Weber. These four positivist theses are logically independent of each other. There have been many thinkers who subscribed to only a couple of these theses while rejecting the others. Thus, Karl Popper rejected the first thesis - the 'scientist' thesis while subscribing to a modified version of the second one, as well as the value-free thesis, and largely rejecting the ideal of a scientific politics as being incompatible with his ideal of an open society. Many people have subscribed to a positivist conception of science while rejecting the 'scientist' thesis (i.e. the Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain). Positivist social science has tended to emphasize quantitative methodologies. In sociology, that has tended to mean an emphasis of such methods as surveys, while in economics this has largely taken the form of an emphasis on mathematical model building and on statistical analysis. And in recent years, sociology has to some extent come to embrace mathematical model building as well. Antipositvists on the other hand are skeptical of modeling social science after the natural sciences. They tend to emphasize the kinship of the social sciences with the humanities. Antipositivism in sociology has led to an emphasis on qualitative or interpretivist methodologies like first-hand observation, interviews, questionnaires, focus groups, participant-observation with the data generally being non-numerical. While in economics, antipositivism, such as found in the Austrian School there is a strong suspicion of using mathematical models. Some notable antipositivists would include people like Dilthey, and Weber, plus people like Scheler, Levi-Strauss, and Geertz. Some varieties of antipositivist sociology would include phenomenological sociology, ethnomethodology, and postmodern forms of sociology. We can see these positivist/anti-positivist debates going on in different social science disciplines and within different and even opposing ideological camps. Thus, within economics, Milton Friedman was a notable defender of a positivist approach to economics: “ Economics as a positive science is a body of tentatively accepted generalisations about economic phenomena that can be used to predict the consequences of changes in circumstances.” Whereas, some of the members of the Austrian School, like Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek were notable anti-positivists. Yet, Friedman, von Mises, and Hayek, all shared similar political outlooks. At the same time, the British socialist economist Joan Robinson, a famous Left Keynesian, in her 1962 book, Economic Philosophy, used positivism to ground her critique of mainstream economics. For Robinson, neoclassical economics was grounded in assumptions that are not empirically falsifiable. Although in that book she cited Karl Popper’s writings on the philosophy of science as the philosophical foundation for the critique of neoclassical economics that she pursued in that book, she seems to me to undertake a critique of the foundations of neoclassical economics not unlike the one that Ernst Mach undertook of Newtonian physics in his book, The Science of Mechanics. Just as Mach attempted to expose the metaphysical assumptions that had been uncritically accepted in Newtonian physics, Robinson attempted to similarly expose the metaphysical assumptions that were uncritically accepted by neoclassical economists. Like Mach, she thought that exposing these assumptions as being metaphysical was sufficient grounds for rejecting them, since they were not testable, but were reflective of the ruling ideologies in society, and in her opinion, constituted obstacles to the advance of economic science. As she put it: \\"Economics limps along with one foot in untested hypotheses and the other in untestable slogans.\\" In drawing distinctions between science and metaphysics, she drew heavily upon Karl Popper’s falsifiability criterion. Yet, this usage of Popper seems to me to be a good example of the creative misuse of a thinker's ideas. Popper himself was not particularly anti-metaphysical. In fact he took the logical positivists to task precisely on that point. And my impression of Popper is that he had no objections as such against the use of metaphysical assumptions within science. So Robinson's program in regards to economics seems much more in tune with those of the logical positivists than it is with Popper's own programs. (BTW Karl Popper was longtime friend of Friedrich Hayek, although he considered himself to be a socialist or a social democrat for most of his adult life). I think that it is noteworthy that in the 1973 undergraduate textbook on economics that she co-authored with John Eatwell, Introduction to Modern Economics, she reiterated the same arguments that she had presented in Economic Philosophy, but she made no mention at all of Karl Popper. Likewise, among Marxists, such debates have been going on for well over a hundred years. Nikolai Bukharin, for instance, wrote a treatise on historical materialism that was explicitly positivist in its approach. Antonio Gramsci famously wrote a review in his Prison Notebooks that panned that book, in which Gramsci took a strongly anti-positivist stance, as did also Lukacs. Returning to Bukharin, in his book,[LINKED_TEXT: Historical Materialism] [URL: https://www.marxists.org/archive/bukharin/works/1921/histmat/index.htm], he insisted that social reality, like the natural world, is governed by objective causal laws and that the reign of causality in society, excludes any role for teleology, just as the progress of the natural sciences has led to the replacement of teleological explanations by causal explanations. In Bukharin’s view, a scientific sociology based on the materialist conception of history will likewise lead to the replacement of teleological explanations of social phenomena by causal explanations. In the end, Bukharin probably accepted at least three of the theses that Keat identified as characteristic of positivism. And it should be noted that the full title of his book was , [LINKED_TEXT: Historical Materialism-A System of Sociology.] [URL: https://www.marxists.org/archive/bukharin/works/1921/histmat/index.htm] . Up to then, most Marxists had been hostile to sociology, which they saw as a bourgeois discipline. Bukharin by writing about a Marxist sociology suggested that kind of rapprochement was possible. And in his case, the possibility of such a rapprochement was grounded in the acceptance of a positivist approach to social science. Antonio Gramsci in his Prison Notebooks, took exception to Bukharin’s approach, concentrating his fire on Bukharin’s positivism, which he regarded as being incompatible with Marxism And Lukacs criticized Bukharin along similar lines too. He wrote: But in his philosophical remarks, Bukharin rejects all the elements in Marxist method which derive from classical German philosophy, without realizing the inconsistency this involves. Of course, Hegel is mentioned from time to time, but the essential comparison of his and Marx’s dialectic is absent. Characteristically, the only reference to Feuerbach is to note that with him ‘matter came to the fore’; ‘his influence on Marx and Engels assisted the development of the true theory of dialectical materialism.’ He completely ignores the problem of the relation between Feuerbach’s humanism and the Marxist dialectic. This point has been particularly stressed because it clearly reveals the essential error in Bukharin’s conception of historical materialism. The closeness of Bukharin’s theory to bourgeois, natural-scientific materialism derives from his use of ‘science’ (in the French sense) as a model. In its concrete application to society and history it therefore frequently obscures the specific feature of Marxism: that all economic or ‘sociological’ phenomena derive from the social relations of men to one another. Emphasis on a false ‘objectivity’ in theory leads to fetishism. Within the Marxist tradition, members of the Frankfurt School were notorious for being staunch critics of positivism, in both its Marxian and bourgeois forms. Criticisms of positivism are rampant in the writings of Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, and Herbert Marcuse. In the 1960’s, members of the Frankfurt School, including both older members like Adorno, and younger members like Habermas debated these issues with Karl Popper and Hans Albert. Popper denied being a positivist, yet he held certain views that were closely akin to those held by the positivists. He held to a hypothetico-deductive model of scientific inquiry. In the end, much of the debate centered around the issue of reform versus revolution, with Popper and Albert arguing for incremental reforms, while the Frankfurters holding out for revolution. However, it seems to me that the debate was orthogonal to the debate over positivism versus antipositivism, since one can find both positivists and antipositivists on both sides of the reform versus revolution debate. Positivism And the Struggle Against Socialism (Capitalism)? Both von Mises and Hayek, were originally reacting against the writings in defense of socialist economic planning that were penned by the socialist economist Otto Neurath, who was also one of the founders of the Vienna Circle of logical positivists. For Hayek, in particular, the critique of positivism in economics and the social sciences generally was a crucial part of the struggle against socialism. Meanwhile, the Frankfurt School, which was Marxist, was also very notably anti-positivist. For them, positivism was one of the fundamental props of contemporary capitalist ideologies, which are often technocratic in nature. So for them, the critique of positivism was necessary for the struggle against capitalism.

In fact, I have heard some place him above Jimi Hendrix. That being said, I get the feeling that Jimmy Page always works better in a band setting. The spark provided by a creative partnership energizes his creative juices. Note that Page has only released one solo album, 1988’s Outrider, during a career now stretching almost sixty years. (That is, if you don't count the 1982 soundtrack to Death Wish II.) In this sense, Jimmy Page is the opposite of an artist like Neil Young, who seems to produce his best work on his own. Jimmy has always seemed to need the creative framework of a band to truly unleash his awe-inspiring talent. Since Led Zeppelin's demise in 1980 following the death of John Bonham, Robert Plant has refused to agree to any kind of reunion apart from the very occasional one-off performance. I feel that this hurts Page very much, though he may present a stoic face to the world. Zeppelin was his baby, if you will; his greatest gift to the world. If anyone would love to see a Zeppelin reunion as much as the fans, it's Jimmy Page. Page has tried to recapture that lightning-in-a-bottle with Paul Rodgers (The Firm) and David Coverdale (Coverdale/Page), and briefly even with Plant again in the '90s (Page & Plant). He is said to be working on a solo album, and says he can't wait for the world to hear it. Jimmy Page is one of the greatest musicians to ever walk the Earth.

Which would mean that the future in which Ezra discovered the World Between Worlds would never have existed, and he would not have been in a position to save Kanan. With Ashoka, on the other hand, the situation was different. Ezra’s last sight of Ashoka before the temple door closed was her fighting Vader. He didn’t see her die. No-one did. They just assumed that Vader killed her, and it’s not like Vader was going to discuss the matter with them. Removing Ashoka from the temple and pulling her forward in time had no effect whatsoever on Ezra’s past self, or that of his friends. Whether she vanishes from the temple, or dies at Vader’s hands, it’s the same to past Ezra. He doesn’t know what happened.

He rarely talks about Modi and has tried avoiding him for his own good. Elections in India are won mainly by promising freebies and bribing voters. A general acceptance that the AAP government has done good work -- especially in schools, and in implementing regular water and electricity supply, there is some frustration with delays and unmet promises. Kejriwal is a popular figure as well as polarising. AAP government has introduced several populist measures, which are aimed at consolidating their support base before the assembly election next year. This will lead to the party facing difficulty in garnering support among the upper and middle classes. Bjp will maintain its voteshare of 32% of last elections and may add little more through article 370 but Kejriwals performance only depends on Congress as both share same votebank. Congress doesnt have a face in Delhi and BJP has Manoj Tiwari who is not popular among 70% population of the state. Delhi people vote differently in Loksabha and assembly since 90s.

North India at the time was divided between different powers. Each of them trying to gain power and influence at the expense of others. It is safe to assume that if it weren’t for such conditions, Babur was unlikely to have invaded. The Indian Subcontinent just prior to Babur’s invasion The Delhi Sultanate had ceased to be the powerful empire that it had once been following the invasion of Timur, Babur’s ancestor, in 1398. The Tughlaq Dynasty was defeated and destroyed by Timur. The Sayyid Dynasty and the Lodi Dynasty that would follow would never reach the status of the Delhi Sultanate from before. Much of the territory was lost and would never be gained again. This included Bengal, a wealthy region, which was now an independent sultanate. The Lodi Dynasty was at its peak under the rule of Sikander Lodi. He was succeeded by his son, Ibrahim Lodi, in 1517. Under Ibrahim’s rule, the Lodi Dynasty would decline and break into infighting. The problems began immediately after his accession. Not everyone supported Ibrahim. Many of the Afghan nobles instead supported him brother, Jalaluddin Lodi. This eventually resulted in a war which was won by Ibrahim. Unfortunately for him, this was just the beginning of his problems. After consolidating power, Ibrahim began to replace many of the old nobles with new and younger ones that would be more loyal towards him. Unfortunately for him, the old nobles who had served his father were experienced and powerful. This resulted in many of them turning against him. To make matters even worse, the Delhi Sultanate faced many external threats as well. The greatest of these was Rana Sanga, the Rajput Rana of Mewar, who had managed to build up a powerful Rajput confederation. The two sides went to war twice in the Battle of Khatoli (1518) and Battle of Dholpur (1519). Both of these ended as humiliating defeat for the Afghans, which further weakened Ibrahim Lodi’s position as the Sultan. Then there was the matter of the Gujarat Sultanate giving refuge to Alauddin Lodi, a rebellion uncle of Ibrahim. This further weakened his position. The Delhi Sultanate under the Lodi Dynasty also had other issues. Matters such as trade and infrastructure, both of which were doing poorly. The Delhi Sultanate had lost access to the rich lands of Bengal. It had also lost connection to the ports of Bengal and Gujarat. It had also lost connection to the trade with Central Asia. Plus, the road networks had not been repaired for a long time and were no longer functional. All of this left the Delhi Sultanate weak and a shadow of its former self. Rana Sanga The region of North India was a bit of a free-for-all around the time of Babur’s invasion. The Delhi Sultanate was in conflict with the Rajput confederation of Rana Sanga. It had poor relations with the Gujarat Sultanate. It had previously been at war with the Bengal Sultanate. However, the attempt to conquer Bengal had failed and the Lodi Dynasty had to settle for an uneasy truce with the Bengal Sultanate. Rana Sanga seemed to be waging wars in all directions and performing quite well in these conflicts. After rising to power, he his Rajput confederation had defeated both the Delhi Sultanate and Gujarat Sultanate in multiple battles. In doing so, he had established himself as a powerful player in North India. The Gujarat Sultanate had been at war with Rana Sanga. They were also trying to undermine Ibrahim Lodi by providing refuge to his enemies. All of this created the perfect set of conditions during Babur’s invasion. Babur would have to face no unified resistance in North India. Instead, each group would face him individually. In some cases, others would offer to assist him in this. Each one of them seemed to have thought that Babur would leave after invading and plundering the Delhi Sultanate, like his ancestors had before him. Unfortunately for all of them, they were wrong. Babur had long-term plans in North India that none of them could have imagined. A map of the region just prior to Babur’s invasion Babur invades the Delhi Sultanate As I mentioned before, Ibrahim Lodi had alienated many of the powerful Afghan nobles from his father’s era. One of these was Daulat Khan Lodi, the governor of Lahore. Ghazi Khan, the son of Daulat Khan, had found out that Ibrahim planned to remove his father from his position as the governor of Lahore. He quickly informed him father. Daulat Khan realized that he alone could not hold out against Ibrahim Lodi. He would need help. He found an ally in Alauddin Lodi, Ibrahim’s uncle. Together the two of them requested assistance from Babur, the Timurid King of Kabul at the time. Babur had been eyeing India already and this provided him with the perfect excuse. Daulat Khan and Alauddin had requested Babur’s help and offered his allegiance in exchange. This was an opportunity that Babur was not going to pass upon. Babur sent a message to Ibrahim Lodi in Delhi. Babur claimed that the throne of Delhi belonged to him, as it had to Timur. Ibrahim Lodi obviously did not agree to this. In 1524, Babur moved towards Lahore. He heard news that Daulat Khan had been driven out of Lahore by the forces of Ibrahim Lodi. Upon arriving outside of Lahore, Babur faced the forces of the Sultanate. The forces were defeated and Lahore was captured. Babur then marched on the city of Dibalpur and took the city. Alauddin Khan was placed in charge of the city. Daulat Khan was awarded with the cities of Jullundur and Sultanpur. However, he refused this position as he was expecting Lahore to be handed to him. Babur After taking control of Punjab, Babur returned to Kabul and headed north to deal with the Uzbek threat. Alauddin was soon driven out by Ibrahim Lodi and forced to retreat to Kabul. Babur provided him with men to launch an attack against Ibrahim Lodi once more. Alauddin joined forces with Daulat Khan and the two laid siege to Delhi itself. Ibrahim Lodi was able to defeat their forces and both were forced to retreat. In 1525, Babur heard news that Daulat Khan had betrayed Alauddin Khan and taken control of Punjab for himself. Babur led him forces himself this time and headed to Lahore. Babur laid siege to the fort and Daulat Khan and his sons surrendered. He was more or less pardoned for treason. Though he would die soon after. This time Babur continued deeper into North India towards Delhi. From Delhi, Ibrahim Lodi marched with a massive army to deal with Babur. The two sides would meet at Panipat and face each other on 21 April 1526 in the First Battle of Panipat. Babur’s superior weapons and tactics, combined with a far more disciplined and organized army, helped him win a great victory. Ibrahim Lodi died in the battle. Babur would soon take Delhi and bring an end to the three century rule of the Delhi Sultanate and usher in the era of the Mughal Empire. Mughal art depicting the First Battle of Panipat Babur vs the Rajput confederacy Babur was not the only one that had plans for conquering the Delhi Sultanate. Rana Sanga had similar plans. Prior to the Battle of Panipat, he offered Babur assistance against Ibrahim Lodi. The plan was that Babur would march on Delhi, while Rana Sanga marched on Agra. However, no assistance came from Rana Sanga at the time of battle. It seems as if Rana Sanga had planned to allow Babur and the Lodi Dynasty to fight each other and weaken themselves. Perhaps his plan was to defeat whoever won, while they were weak. Or perhaps, just like Daulat Khan, he too believed that Babur would withdraw after plundering Delhi. Once Babur decided to establish himself in North India, conflict between the two sides became inevitable. In 1527, Rana Sanga began to gather forces for his confederation. The remaining Afghans united under Mahmud Lodi, brother of Ibrahim Lodi, and joined forces with the Rajputs to form a Rajput-Afghan alliance. The purpose of this was to drive the Timurids out of North India, who both sides perceived as a greater threat. The two sides met each other on 16 March 1527 in the Battle of Khanwa. The forces of Rana Sanga were far more disciplined than the forces of Ibrahim Lodi and present a greater challenge. However, at the end, Babur was victorious. This was once again due to his superior weapons (gunpowder weapons) and modern tactics. This victory established the Mughal Empire as the dominant power in North India. Rana Sanga survived and would try to rebuild an army to challenge Babur once more. However, this would be of no use. He was eventually killed by his own chiefs, who had no intention of facing Babur once more. Battle of Khanwa"},{"prompt":"Are antiabortion laws Godly?","completion":"Depends on one's perspective.

My answer to this is Yes and i can guess this short story might help you too to feel the same. There was a business executive who was deep in debt and could see no way out.Creditors were closing in on him. Suppliers were demanding payment. He sat on the park bench, head in hands, wondering if anything could save his company from bankruptcy.Suddenly an old man appeared before him. “I can see that something is troubling you,” he said.After listening to the executive’s woes, the old man said, “I believe I can help you.”He asked the man his name, wrote out a check, and pushed it into his hand saying, “Take this money. Meet me here exactly one year from today, and you can pay me back at that time.”Then he turned and disappeared as quickly as he had come.The business executive saw in his hand a check for 500,000, signed by John D. Rockefeller, then one of the richest men in the world!“I can erase my money worries in an instant!” he realized. But instead, the executive decided to put the uncashed check in his safe. Just knowing it was there might give him the strength to work out a way to save his business, he thought.With renewed optimism, he negotiated better deals and extended terms of payment. He closed several big sales. Within a few months, he was out of debt and making money once again.Exactly one year later, he returned to the park with the uncashed check. At the agreed-upon time, the old man appeared. But just as the executive was about to hand back the check and share his success story, a nurse came running up and grabbed the old man.“I’m so glad I caught him!” she cried. “I hope he hasn’t been bothering you. He’s always escaping from the rest home and telling people he’s John D. Rockefeller.”And she led the old man away by the arm.The astonished executive just stood there, stunned. All year long he’d been wheeling and dealing, buying and selling, convinced he had half a million dollars behind him.Suddenly, he realized that it wasn’t the money, real or imagined, that had turned his life around. It was his new found self-confidence that gave him the power to achieve anything he went after. So to conclude i just want to quote \\" Trust yourself.

They hardly have any electronic machines for 21C such as a washing machine, a mobile phone, a cooler. In this circumstance, they easily suffer from severe illnesses and bugs like roach, flies, mosquitoes, and even mice. What is sad is that they’re not easily seen in the town or city. This is because they’re literally hidden from other normal or high buildings. So, normally people don’t recognize the poor in their daily lives. In other words, they’re isolated. As a result, they sometimes die in their home without any recognition from others. Then, someone calls police for its stinky smell later, and finally the dead are found in their home with decay. “상황이 이렇다 보니, 혼자 쪽방촌에서 살던 거주자가 사망한 후에야 발견되는 안타까운 사고도 있었다. 지난해 6월 영등포구 쪽방촌에서는 50대 남성이 숨진 채 발견됐다. 사인은 심근경색이었다. 이 남성이 발견된 지 1시간이 뒤, 불과 30m 떨어진 곳에서 또 다른 시신이 발견됐다. 사인은 일산화탄소 중독이었다.” “As their situation is this, there were sad accidents that people living alone in the shanty were found after they died in their home.

I met a couple of girls who came to me because they thought they were pregnant. It transpired that they had been French kissing with a boy! And many girls had no idea about masturbation - not that it’s something we teach. I think it is scandalous when mothers bring their daughters up so unprepared for life. When their explanations about menstruation went no further than “It’s just something we women have to bear. Just offer it up”. I do not intend to insult the wonderful and beautiful state of Minnesota but this is where it mostly happened. Certainly not in Maryland, the other State where I was licensed to practice."},{"prompt":"When cooking, is stir fry the same process as French sauté?","completion":"There are basically two techniques in Chinese stir-fry - chao 炒 and bao 爆 Chao 炒 (fry) technique is similar to sautéing. Wok heated to a high temperature, and before it smokes, a little cooking oil is added down the side of the wok (\\"hot wok, cold oil\\"); followed by dry ingredients like prepped ginger, garlic, shallots to season the oil. After which other ingredients are added, starting with the ones that take the longest time to cook, such as meat. Subsequently a mixed sauce of seasonings - eg. soy sauce, sugar, wine, vinegar - is added. Bao technique 爆; ('pop, explosion') of stir-frying requires high flame (such as Shandong cuisine in northern China). First the wok is heated to a reddish glow over very high fire and then everything else are added in quick succession. It's then continually tossed with very brief pauses to add other ingredients, even more oil. The bao stir fry technique is good for small amounts of food that cook quickly, so the juices do not flow out of the ingredients, therefore a dry stir fry with a wok hei aroma. Both techniques use high heat, but in chao stir-fry a liquid is added, the ingredients cooked is softer Bao stir fries (pic below) result in more crispiness due to Maillard reaction. (Chemical reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars which browns food and gives it flavour.) Personally I have only seen chao technique commonly used in Chinese restaurants in the west. Bao technique stir-frying is more dramatic done fast and furious. After the food has been ladled out of the wok, it must be quickly and thoroughly cleaned to prevent food residues from charring the wok bottom. For chao stir-fry, it's much easier to wash the wok for the next dish."},{"prompt":"As an Operating Room nurse, what was the closest call for the patient you’ve witnessed?","completion":"Once had a patient who was a construction worker.

My mom could no longer dictate how I dressed, how I didn't my hair, if I did make up. She's very aversive to me wearing makeup, but to me, makeup is an art form. I now wear what I want, how I want. The biggest mental change follows those lines. I used to be what I would call a “good kid”. I was a shy, read a lot, insecure, unopiniated. I was good because I did what others told me.

The concern was that there might be microbes on the moon, and the crew might bring them back, and if not for quarantine, wipe out all of humanity. Or something like that. I’m not sure a lot of people thought this was a serious possibility. We certainly couldn’t imagine any life that could survive in the brutal environment of the moon, and even if some sort of life could exist there, it was extremely unlikely to be able to infect humans. The attempt to quarantine the astronauts was kind of half-hearted. They wore special clothes on their helicopter ride from the spacecraft to the aircraft carrier … Once aboard the carrier, they stayed in a converted Airstream trailer — known as the Mobile Quarantine Facility — for the ride back to Houston … They spent the rest of the three-week quarantine in relative comfort at the Lunar Receiving Laboratory … NASA repeated this routine for the Apollo 12 crew … The intention was to quarantine the Apollo 13 crew, but that became unnecessary when an oxygen tank failure prevented a landing on the moon. The Apollo 14 crew was the last to have to quarantine. When none of the quarantined astronauts came down with any kind of “space-flu”, and when examination of the lunar samples yielded not a hint that any kind of life had ever existed on the moon, NASA decided that that was enough of quarantining the crews. You can see one of the Mobile Quarantine Facilities on display at the National Air and Space Museum’s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, near Dulles Airport.

If a general intended to argue, he had better have been prepared, or he would have a hard time. However, in MILITARY matters it could be discussed. What you couldn't do is GET INTO POLITICS (say, MAKE PEACE WITH THE WESTERN PARTNERS, for example) Guderian confronted him several times, but he did it with loyalty and Hitler appreciated the attitude. He argued with him, but Hitler did not see him as a threat. Making comparisons: Does anyone imagine General Marshall proposing to Roosvelt a peace with the Japanese to concentrate on Germany?

I know what your thinking the Tomahawk can use nuclear-tipped warheads as well. and in that case, those tanks are always pretty much dead in every scenario except if the guidance messes up and the Tomahawk can’t get a successful hit and misses horribly the maybe the tank survives or maybe the Missile can’t get a lock on in both scenarios the tanks have a small chance to evade the missile but a chance nonetheless. welp, it was fun making this answer and I hope this answered your question. btw the tank that I was using as an example was an abrams so here you go VS."},{"prompt":"What is the meaning of the left side dot in music notation (notation, sheet music, music)?","completion":"Taste it, and you will find out.

Where should I go? What is go inside?","completion":"Good question, Shubham! Although one cannot lay down the road map, one can indicate or show some pointers, and the rest is the journey of a seeker, and I consider myself also as a seeker. Human beings are conditioned, right from the day they are born to look outside. Our default mode is to look outside: people, things, opinions, directions etc. In other words, we unconsciously look outside. To turn within is a volitional act, a conscious act. Whenever you find yourself facing a problem, a question, and your mind wants to reach out to an external source, say a book, google, etc., for an answer, consciously stop yourself from accessing that external source, instead, look within your own experience to find an answer, clarity, etc. You may find it quite challenging in the beginning, but as you begin to get a hang of it, it will get a bit easier, although not as easy as a click. But, then when you source an answer from within, its quality and depth have no comparison. When an external source gives you an answer, you are reading it, but when you get your answer from within, you are seeing it. It’s as far as I can go to put it in the words. You have to practice it to see how it goes for you. On your inward journey, you will need the help of two allies, patience and focus. Having that said, please don’t take it that I am saying one should not use books, the Internet, social media etc. to find answers. For example, if you have a question that requires informational or technical input, you will obviously refer to the relevant source to get that input.

The alarm clock chimes, and as the sun paints the sky with hues of gold, your day begins. What better way to kickstart this adventure called life than with a steamy cup of coffee, a soothing cup of tea, or a refreshing glass of juice? Buckle up, dear reader, as we embark on a delightful journey through these elixirs of health and happiness. From bewitching brews to enchanting extracts, we're here to spill the beans, leaves, and fruits (pun intended) on everything you need to know about coffee, tea, and juice! Coffee : The Eye-Opening Elixir ☕ Picture this: You're navigating through the fog of morning drowsiness, and suddenly, like a superhero's entrance, coffee swoops in. Ah, the aroma! The first sip is like a cozy blanket for your soul. But did you know that coffee isn't just your wake-up call? It's packed with antioxidants that give your body a dose of armor against free radicals. Sip it mindfully, though, because too much of a good thing can turn you into a jittery squirrel. Tea : Steeping in Serenity 🍵 Now, let's journey east to the mystic lands of tea. With every teabag that takes a plunge, a cup of tranquility is born. Green tea, black tea, herbal tea – they all dance to different tunes. Green tea, a metabolism's best friend, can aid in weight management. Black tea, your knight in shining armor against cholesterol. Herbal tea, the lullaby that puts your stress to sleep.

Juice : Mother Nature's Nectar 🥤 Oh, the crisp goodness of fresh juice on a summer's day! It's like Mother Nature giving you a high-five. From tangy oranges to sweet berries, the rainbow of flavors brings a surge of vitamins and minerals to your body. But beware, dear reader, of the juice trap. Too much sugar, even from fruits, can turn your well-intentioned sip into a sugar rush nightmare. Moderation is the name of the game here. Best Time to Sip : A Symphony of Scheduling 🎶 Timing is everything, they say. Well, it's true for these elixirs too! Picture this: Coffee, your trusty sidekick, is best enjoyed in the morning to kick lethargy's behind. Tea, the yoga class for your insides, finds its prime time in the afternoon. And juice, the hydration hero, is your afternoon delight or post-workout replenishment. Precautions : Sip Sensibly, Sip Smartly ⚠️ As with any adventure, a few precautions can save you from unwanted escapades. Excessive coffee can lead to the mysterious jitters, while overindulgence in tea might turn you into a walking tea kettle. And juice? Too much sugar might summon the sugar monster.

It is. Reservation truly has its merits and Ambika Vijay’s answer does a good job in explaining it. [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #BJajh] But the question does not refer to the merits of reservation but whether the system keeps casteism, or in better words, discrimination, alive. The gold standard for a society is to be one that is solely based on the skills or the competence a person brings into a position. When two candidates are taken into consideration, if the selection procedure takes into consideration any quality other than how capable that person is for the job, it can very well be called discrimination based on that quality. That is exactly what happens when a candidate is given an advantage over the other based on the person’s caste or religion hence keeping discrimination or casteism alive. If caste identifications are removed of its legal validity, the ‘discrimination’ of the contenders would be dependent on their skills, which is what a society should aspire to be.

Nonetheless, I believe I can provide a reasonable answer to this question. My undergraduate institution (Berkeley) provided two courses of study for math majors - Pure Math and Applied Math. All schools that I know of do this. In practice, Pure Math classes are what I consider pencil and paper mathematics. Just about all the work is proofs, and it can all be done on paper. Applied Math is much more oriented towards computers and algorithms. The standard example of an Applied Math topic is how to calculate [math]pi[/math] by throwing random points in a square inscribed with a circle. Obviously, I studied Pure Math as an undergrad, and, as I tell my son, I only like math that doesn’t involve numbers. Mathematical physics is an area I find fascinating. As I said, I have never taken a class in it, but I read about it often. Physics involves a lot of mathematics, but often physicists think of math as a tool or language for solving physics problems. Physicists are often (and usually by mathematicians) thought of as being sloppy and non-rigorous with their math. This is because we are. Mathematicians are very insistent about rigor, whereas physicists just want to get the right answer. So there is a lot of material in physics (both classes and research) that is based on sloppy or poorly defined mathematics. There is even physics based on never defined mathematics. (I remember first seeing things in quantum field theory like the trace of the exponential of a continuously infinite matrix. And mathematicians even get bent out of shape about things like Feynman path integrals!) Anyway, the field of mathematical physics is about filling in that gap between mathematics and physics. It provides rigorous proofs of the sloppy math that physicists use. It also sometimes fills in all the spaces where a physicist usually waves his/her hands and says “it can be shown that” or “it follows that”. In my experience, really good mathematical physics also makes you think more deeply about the physics. Or at least think about it in different ways. Many theoretical physicists spend at least part of their time working on mathematical physics. The one professor I have known who seemed to spend all his time on mathematical physics was [LINKED_TEXT: Eyvind Wichmann] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyvind_Wichmann]. He taught a class at Berkeley that I always wanted to take, but I never had the time in my schedule. The class was “Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics”. The text was his hand written notes. I had a copy of those notes years ago, and I used to read them whenever I had the time.

With sweeping vistas around nearly every curve and long stretches where you’re the only motorist, it’s the kind of road that car enthusiasts dream about. So, it makes sense that just off this highway, you find the Gateway Auto Museum. Part of Discovery Channel founder John Hendrick’s Gateway Canyons Resort & Spa, the museum is home to 52 classic cars devoted to celebrating and showcasing the history, design, ingenuity, and social impact of the American automobile. Keeping a car's engine running efficiently and smoothly is what the exhaust system does, so car enthusiasts should take a look at [LINKED_TEXT: The 10 Best Exhaust System For GMC Sierra] [URL: https://creativeprice.com/10-best-exhaust-system-for-gmc-sierra/] in order to make the best purchase. Here, the docents have helped to draft a list of the greatest cars of all time, including a few that reside in the resort’s unobtrusive low-slung pueblo-style museum. Benz Motorwagen Created in 1886 and powered by an internal combustion engine, the Motorwagen was essentially the world’s first motor car (previous automobiles were powered by steam or electricity). Only 25 were built, and the four-stroke engine that powered the early models produced less than one horsepower. Despite its meager speeds, the vehicle paved the way for the future of cars as we know them today. Waverly Electric Anyone who thinks electric cars are an invention of the twenty-first century is sorely mistaken. The Waverly Electric was produced from 1896 to 1914 and was owned by celebrities, such as Diamond Jim Brady, Willa Cather, and Thomas Edison among its owners. Marketed as a woman-friendly automobile, The Waverly was easy to start, easy to drive, and usually came with an enclosed coach body to protect long skirts from dirt and debris."},{"prompt":"Why are people able to get up on time and work hard for other people but struggle with doing it/working for themselves?","completion":"First of all, not everybody finds it easier to work for others than for themselves. Those who do find it easier to work for others will usually cite reasons like a paycheck, having a clear assignment, having others around to help when assignments get tough, knowing that responsibilities are shared, knowing that somebody “higher up” will be watching for errors before too much damage is done, access to tools, equipment and resources they’d never get their hands on otherwise, and knowing that outstanding effort will (usually) be rewarded. Some, at least, of those things aren’t true when you’re working for yourself. There’s also another factor to consider. Sometimes, we don’t feel we’re worth all that effort. We’ve somehow come to the conclusion that we aren’t all that important, that what happens to us isn’t as important as what happens to the people we work for, or the customers that buy from us, or even our co-workers. That’s a potentially dangerous attitude: in the long run, doing your best for others but denying yourself can result in a situation where you don’t have the necessary personal resources to do your best work. If you work hard for others, you deserve an adequate reward. It may not be financial: a lot of people are paid far less than their work is worth (In the USA, teachers come to mind)! But they still deserve rewards, be it appreciation from students and parents, help with classroom expenses, recognition from the school, recognition from other teachers, etc. Whatever form it takes, we need to be rewarded for working for our own well-being!"},{"prompt":"What are some famous animals throughout history?","completion":"Bucephalus was Alexander the Great’s horse and is considered by some to be the most famous horse in history"},{"prompt":"Did Pfizer purposely hold back on announcing a vaccine for COVID19 in order to hurt Trump’s chances of winning the election?","completion":"Bryce, Always good to ask questions.

Usually all the boys are well behaved, but this time they were not. A few of them started a food fight, and the part of the pizzeria we were seated in ended up looking like a tornado had struck. We parents felt so bad for the staff that we left a tip that was equal to the amount we paid for the food (about USD 200 or so). To punish the kids, we made them clean up the mess they made and apologise to the staff and the other customers, and to further punish my son (who didn’t start the food fight but was a willing participant after it had begun), my wife and I deducted his share of the food + tip (about USD 400 divided by the number of kids on the squad) from his allowance until paid in full, which took about a month.

But the Labour party has a problem with its “constituency” which is split. This is not unique; centre-left parties in many countries have the same problem. On the one hand, there is the traditional support from large parts of the working class (never all of it). But that class has reduced as a proportion of the population, and it is much more diverse in terms of life-chances and standard of living. Meanwhile, the notional middle class has increased. In particular, the number of white-collar jobs involving work other than being the bosses of workers has increased. These have trended leftwards, but have a different set of priorities. They are not hostile to the working class, but when presented with working class problems, tend to fall back on welfare as the only solution. They have come to dominate the centre left. A few, insulated from the realities of working class life, have gone hard, ideological left. Many are fixated on issues principally affecting, or at least visible, to themselves. these are not those faced by those at the bottom. Being ancient, I can see this development during my lifetime. In the 1950’s the old-fashioned, very statist socialism of the Labour party was increasingly discredited. But the Tories got stale, and retained the atmosphere of upper class lack of modernity. Harold Wilson’s genius was tapping into this, attracting many middle class voters with the lure of modernity and technocratic efficiency. Equally, and far more damaging to Labour, Margaret Thatcher turned the tables, making the Tories no longer the party of privileged toffs. Down with poncy middle class Marxists, and with antediluvian trade unionists! Both of them recognised that traditional class-based politics was breaking down. Blair simply extended this thinking. He blew it with Iraq (chance often makes a mess of neat categories). I suspect that what is happening now is a sly proletarianisation of large chunks of the middle class. But they have not yet woken up to this, and the Labour Party has certainly not capitalised on it.The Tories have played the ends against the middle very successfully. The middle (myself included) need to wake up and smell the coffee. The Tories are coming for us. Their tanks are on our lawn.

Here's a satisfactory answer that addresses the question and promotes a relevant book titled \\"Impact of Microwave Heated Food on Health\\" published in the Journal of Advances in Biology. Answer: The impact of cooking food in a microwave oven on your health has been extensively studied. Microwaves use electromagnetic waves to generate heat, which leads to the rapid cooking of food. Overall, microwave cooking is considered safe and does not inherently pose health risks. Microwaves heat food by agitating water molecules, causing them to generate heat and cook the food. While there have been concerns about potential nutrient loss during microwave cooking, studies suggest that microwaving can actually help retain more nutrients compared to other cooking methods. The shorter cooking time in microwaves helps preserve heat-sensitive vitamins and minerals. Regarding potential health risks, microwave ovens are designed to prevent harmful radiation exposure. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sets strict guidelines to ensure microwave ovens meet safety standards and emit minimal levels of radiation. When used according to manufacturer instructions, microwave ovens are safe for everyday use. For a more in-depth understanding of the impact of microwave heated food on health, I recommend reading the book \\"Impact of Microwave Heated Food on Health.\\" This book, published in the Journal of Advances in Biology, explores the latest research and findings in this area, providing valuable insights into the effects of microwave cooking on nutrition and health. 🔗 Access the book \\"Impact of Microwave Heated Food on Health\\" through the Journal of Advances in Biology to deepen your knowledge and make informed decisions about your cooking methods.

For example, magazines, clips, assault rifles, assault guns, assault weapons, ARs, etc.","completion":"Magazine: How modern weapons (not counting revolvers) are fed. A magazine consists of a tube, box, or drum with a spring and a follower, a piece of usually plastic or metal, trapped within them, with the top open and typically bent in to hold a round in place. Magazines can be and typically are detachable, meaning you can remove the empty one and put in a new one, but there are some internal magazines that are an innate part of the gun (look at the M1 Garand or the Steyr Scout for good examples). A magazine can be straight or curved, short or long, double stack or single stack, or even a rotating drum; a magazine can hold between 1 and 200 rounds (generally anywhere above 50-60 starts being heavy, bulky and unreliable). Magazine Types: Single Stack: Rounds are stacked neatly on top of one another. Very slim magazine, very simple design, but low capacity and usually unable to be used with rimmed cartridges. See the M1911 magazine for a good example. Double Stack: Rounds are stacked in a zig-zag pattern. Wider magazine and requiring more complex designs and feeding mechanisms, but greatly increased capacity. See Glock magazines or most AR magazines for examples. Double stack magazines are by far the more common today. Internal: A magazine that is a part of the gun, rather than a removable piece. May be single or double stack, and may make use of stripper clips or enbloc clips. See the M1 Garand, Mosin-Nagant M91/30, or Karabiner 98K. Common in older rifles and bolt-actions, uncommon in modern rifles and almost unheard of in handguns. Clip: A simple piece of metal that holds rounds together, usually at the back. Serves to quickly reload (usually internal) magazines by allowing you to set all rounds in easily using a (usually) disposable metal piece, rather than loading them one at a time. Revolver speedloaders also count as clips. Clip Types: Stripper Clip: The more common of the two rifle clips. A stripper clip at its most basic is simply a bent chunk of metal that you can slide rounds onto, having it grip them by the base or the rim. You align the clip with the magazine, then push the top round down until it is in the top of the magazine. You may then remove the clip, and your magazine is now (if you used a stripper clip with enough rounds) loaded. There are too many examples of these to nail down specific ones; go on Amazon or Google Images and look up “stripper clip”. Enbloc Clip: The less common, yet more famous of the rifle clips. Rather than stripping the rounds off of the clip and removing it, like a stripper clip, you place the enbloc clip in the magazine and leave it there. It will function as a part of the magazine, feeding rounds from it until empty, at which point it may be ejected or removed. The most famous example of this is the M1 Garand; the distinctive “Garand Ping\\" is the sound of the enbloc clip being ejected. Speedloaders: Similar in concept to a stripper clip, but for revolvers and wheelguns rather than magazine-fed firearms. A speedloader holds the correct number of rounds in the configuration they would sit in in a cylinder. To reload, rather than loading each round individually, you place the speedloader in such that it loads each round, then either press the release button or snap the speedloader off depending on manufacturer. Again, just Google “speedloader\\" to see what I mean. Belts/Belt-fed/Chains: Pretty much exactly what it sounds like. Several rounds, up to a theoretically infinite number, are linked together into a chain using links made of plastic, cloth or metal. The firearm then advances the chain to the next position, loads the round, and either pushes out the chain or spits out the links depending on the style of belt. Much greater theoretical capacity, and ability to feed more reliably at higher speeds, makes this common in machine guns. This is also why machine guns are sometimes called chainguns. Cylinders/Revolvers: A revolver is a firearm that holds its rounds in a cylinder, or circular shape, rather than in a magazine. As the weapon is fired, the cylinder rotates or revolves, aligning the next round in the cylinder. While a revolver can technically hold as many rounds as your mechanism can support, they're generally limited to between 4 and 8 rounds, with 5 and 6 being most common; anything lower is impractical and anything higher is too bulky and heavy. Revolvers, unlike magazine-fed firearms, can also use rimmed cartridges; in fact, most revolver cartrdiges like .38 Special and .357 Magnum are rimmed cartridges. Pistol: By definition, a pistol is any short firearm without a stock, typically firing smaller rounds than a rifle, and typically with a rifled barrel. This could be anything, from flintlocks, to derringers, to revolvers, to Glocks. However, when people say pistol, they usually mean automatics, also known as semi-automatic or self-loading pistols. While there are a variety of mechanisms to make a pistol feed and cycle, the basics are largely the same. A round is loaded with the slide open, then seated in the chamber as the slide closes. Then, the hammer strikes the firing pin and sends it forward, or the striker is sent forward, depending on the style of pistol. This impacts the primer at the base of the cartridge, firing the round. The round firing, through one mechanism or another, pushes the slide open, which extracts the round from the chamber and ejects it (usually upwards) while loading the next round in the magazine. Rifle: A rifle is any long gun with a stock and a rifled barrel. A popular subtype of rifle, the carbine, has a shortened barrel to be more compact. A rifled barrel is a barrel with rifling, or twists, cut into it to spin the bullet, allowing it to go farther and be much more accurate. A stock is simply the shoulder piece, usually in a triangle shape. You rest the stock against your shoulder and transfer recoil into your shoulder instead of your hands and wrist. There are many types of rifles; the most commonly seen are bolt-action, semiautomatic, or select-fire. This includes guns often nicknamed “hunting rifles\\" as well as sporting rifles (or semiautomatics, called assault weapons by CNN and anti-gun politicians) and genuine assault rifles. There are also battle rifles, which are notable less common. Rifle Types/Names: Semiautomatic: A semi-automatic, or self-loading, rifle is a rifle that functions similarly to a pistol; upon firing, the action of firing a round chambers the next round while ejecting the previous. However, a semi-automatic firearm (modifications, accidents and faulty design notwithstanding) will only ever fire one round with each pull of the trigger. This is one of the most common actions of firearm today, and one that has existed since the late 1800s if not earlier. Select Fire: A select fire rifle allows the user to switch between semiautomatic, safe (or not firing), and either burst fire (firing multiple, usually 2 or 3, rounds per pull of the trigger) or automatic (firing continuously as the trigger is held). These are the rifles most modern militaries use; this is also the distinguishing feature of assault rifles and battle rifles. Assault Rifle: An assault rifle is a select-fire rifle firing an intermediate cartridge. Assault rifles are what are typically used by modern militaries; popular examples include the M16 rifle or M4 carbine, the Famas assault rifle, the AK series, and the Steyr Aug. However, they date back to late World War 1 or just after; depending on your definition of intermediate cartridge, the first assault rifle was either the Federov Avtomat produced in Russia in late WW1 or the Sturmgewehr assault rifle produced in Germany shortly after the war. Battle Rifle: A battle rifle is a select-fire rifle firing a full power cartridge. These were popular for a short time, but have largely been phased out in favor of assault rifles due to battle rifle's recoil and weight. Notable examples are the FN FAL, used by UN Peacekeeping forces, and the M14, a select-fire M1 Garand with removable magazines. Bolt-action: A bolt-action rifle, commonly nicknamed hunting rifles or sniper rifles, is a rifle that requires the user to directly manipulate the bolt to cycle the rifle. Typically, this requires the user to lift the bolt out of its locked state, bring it to the rear to eject the round and load the next one, then send it back forward and lock it back into place between shots. There are also lever-action rifles, like the 1860 Henry, that use a round lever on the underside of the rifle rather than a bolt; there are also straight-pull rifles that can simply be cycled back and forth without needing to rotate the bolt. Shotguns: A shotgun is a smooth-bore firearm that may or may not have a stock and fires shot, either in the form of different shot packages or in slugs/balls. Smooth bore means that the barrel is a straight tube, rather than being rifled. While muskets were technically shotguns since they did not have rifled barrels, the earliest guns typically called shotguns are blunderbusses. Shotguns, unlike rifles, can easily and safely fire shot packages containing multiple projectiles, but at the cost of accuracy; even a slug from a good shotgun is less accurate than a high-quality rifle of the same make. Shotguns may be semiautomatic or rarely automatic; they may also be revolvers, lever action, or pump action. Machine Guns: A machine gun is any weapon designed for automatic, usually sustained, fire. Typically used for suppressing enemies (aka keeping their heads down) or covering a large area with fire, machine guns do not need the accuracy of rifles and rather rely on sheer volume of fire to dominate a battlefield. Machine Gun Types: Submachine Gun: A submachine gun is a compact machine gun firing pistol cartridges. These serve to put automatic fire in an extremely portable, easy to use package. These were developed in World War 1 to clear trenches quickly; at the time, machine guns were extremely heavy and typically unable to be fired while moving. These still serve today, typically in the hands of special forces, SWAT teams, and anti-terrorist units; namely, the event that led to the founding of the SAS. Famous examples include the HK MP5 and its variants, the M1 Thompson (aka Tommy Gun), and the Kriss Vector. Machine Pistol: A machine pistol is a subset of submachine guns designed to be extraordinarily small and light. Think of them as a pistol, but capable of automatic fire. These were never terribly popular, and their main role (tank crewmen and pilots) was replaced by SMGs and carbines. The most famous example is the Vz.61 Scorpion. PDW: A PDW, or personal defense weapon, is another subset of SMG. These were created to give higher power and better armour penetration than SMGs while being just as if not more compact; the two most famous PDWs competed to become NATO standard, but the adoption was cancelled. These are, again, not terribly popular, but do still exist unlike machine pistols. Famously, the HK MP7 and the FN P90 were developed in parallel with the hopes of becoming the NATO standard PDW, but Germany (if I remember correctly) vetoed the adoption. Gatling Gun: A Gatling gun, commonly called a minigun, is a machine gun with multiple barrels that rotate, allowing even greater sustained fire and faster firing rates due to not worrying about overheating the barrel (since each barrel only has to transport 1 shot every so often, and are moving fast enough to be air cooled). The name comes from one of the first people to envision the concept; previously, before modern cartridges, you could only fire one shot before having to reload, which required refilling the barrel by hand. Gatling, along with Puckle, came up with the idea of having multiple loaded barrels, allowing the user to rotate them via crank or machine and fire multiple shots rather quickly without reloading. Chaingun: Also called simply a machine gun, and divided into subtypes like LMGs, HMGs, GPMGs and SAWs. This is what most people think of when they hear machine gun; belt fed, fully automatic, and delivering tons of lead downrange. See the M249 SAW for a good example. Cartridges: A cartridge is a singular, self-contained piece of ammunition. The case, or metal body, contains gunpowder, while the end or head of the case holds a bullet in place. The rear of a cartridge holds the primer, an impact-sensitive compound. When the firing pin or hammer strikes the primer, it detonates, igniting the gunpowder. This explosion and expanding gas propel the bullet extremely quickly down the barrel and out of the end of the barrel, called the muzzle. The empty case can then be removed to make way for the next round. Rifle and pistol cartridges are typically categorised with a number or pair of numbers, while shotgun shells are often given a gauge. The single number, such as Xmm or .XX, refers to the width of the bullet, while the double number such as X×X refers to both the bullet width and the length of the cartridge (for example, 7.62×54 is longer than 7.62×39). Shotgun gauges are based off of the width of the bore or barrel, and iirc are based on how many lead balls that size it takes to weigh a certain weight (I forget if it's a pound or a kilo). Cartridge Types: Rimmed: A rimmed cartridge has a ring, or rim, on the back of the cartridge. Typically seen in revolvers, this rim assists in removing the case, as the gun can simply push on the rim rather than pulling the case out. This rim, however, makes it difficult to incorporate into magazines due to not stacking well. Rimless: As you might guess, a rimless cartridge does not have this rim, and usually has grooves cut into it instead for an extractor to grip on to. These feed much better in magazines, but tend to have a hard time working in revolvers due to being one static width and thus requiring extra work to prevent them becoming unseated in the cylinder. Intermediate: An intermediate cartridge has less power than a full-power rifle cartridge, but more than a pistol round. These allow for increased power over a pistol or submachine gun while still being controllable in full auto, as well as being lighter and smaller than rifle rounds. Common examples are 7.62×39 and 5.56 NATO. Full-power: A full power rifle round has increased power over an intermediate cartridge. This allows for far greater velocities and impact force than an intermediate cartridge. They're also typically much larger bullets, making a bigger wound or impact on a target. Common examples are .308 also known as 7.62 NATO and .30-06. Shotgun, Buckshot: Buckshot consists of large steel balls, designed to hit hard and bring down large targets due to sheer impact (such as, as the name suggests, deer). This is one of the most common shotgun ammunition types, and what is typically featured as shotgun shells/shotgun shots in video games and movies. Shotgun, Birdshot: Birdshot consists of many small steel pellets, often no larger than a steel BB, designed to cover a very wide area with more shot than buckshot with reduced power. This makes it ideal for, as the name implies, shooting birds out of the sky, as it gives you many more chances to hit the bird, while the force of buckshot isn't really necessary to kill ducks, pheasants and the like. In general, think buckshot = big things and power, birdshot = small things and volume. Shotgun, Slug: A slug is a single, large chunk of metal, either a ball or shaped like a bullet. This allows a shotgun to function like a large-caliber rifle, albeit still without a rifled barrel. Pistol: A pistol cartridge is any compact cartridge firing small projectiles. Common examples are 9mm, .45 ACP, and .50 AE. Rimfire: While a centerfire cartridge has its primer in the middle of the rear of the case, a rimfire cartrdige has it along the edge or rim. One of the only commonly used rimfire cartridges in modern times is .22LR. Specialty: You can also make rifle cartridges in even larger sizes, such as .50 BMG and 12.7mm, as well as incorporating burning or explosive bullets. You can also make shotgun shells that fire tons of darts, or shrapnel, or even fire (Dragon's Breath rounds). There's also the .410 round; a shotgun shell designed for pistols and smaller shotguns. There are even rifle rounds designed to fire multiple bullets stacked on top of one another, or to fire nothing but gas. There's also blank cartridges, which go off like a normal cartridge but don't fire anything other than a paper or wax cap; these are used a lot in Hollywood or as starter pistols in athletics. Assault Weapons, Assault Guns, and ARs: An AR is typically referring to the Colt/Armalite AR-15 or AR-10. This pattern of rifle is the most common in the United States, and is a line of semiautomatic, highly modular and customizable rifles in a range of intermediate and full-power rounds, as well as being offered in some pistol rounds. This is also a prime target for gun control advocates; they look scary and are semiautomatic, and have unfortunately been used in quite a few horrendous acts of violence. Assault weapon or assault gun is a buzzword used primarily by the anti-gun crowd; it refers to basically anything semiautomatic they wish to oppose, typically black, military-looking, scary rifles such as the AR-15. The definition changes based on who you're talking to and where; it's typically defined as being intermediate or semiautomatic and having some number of a list of largely cosmetic or ergonomic features such as pistol grips, removable magazines, and the like. In general, if someone calls a rifle an assault weapon or calls a semiautomatic rifle an assault rifle, you can generally assume they don't know much about firearms and/or wish to ban or restrict them. Special Weapons: There are a variety of other weapons that also fall under the category of firearms, such as flare guns, grenade launchers, and anti-tank rifles. There are also weapons that are not firearms but are commonly lumped into “guns\\", such as flamethrowers and rocket launchers. I don't have the time to go into every tube with a handle that's ever launched things at other things, but you're free to do your own research. If you're looking to learn more about firearms, I highly recommend finding some good YouTubers and internet resources. I can personally recommend Forgotten Weapons, often affectionately nicknamed Gun Jesus, if you'd like to learn more about historical firearms, weapons development, and what goes on inside a gun. There's also Bloke on the Range, who tackles common myths regarding historical rifles, as well as Garand Thumb and plenty of other gun YouTubers. The internet has some mixed sources, as everyone has their bias, but with enough searching you can find solid information available. While your primary school teacher may have rejected it, Wikipedia is actually rather reliable as far as internet resources go, and you can and should read Wikipedia articles on firearms to learn more than this basic overview."},{"prompt":"it safe to run a 1700 watt air fryer and a George Foreman grill in the same outlet (grill on top plug, fryer on bottom plug in the outlet)?","completion":"In North America, plugging in operating both of those appliances on the same 20-amp, 120-volt duplex receptacle will trip the circuit breaker."},{"prompt":"What genetic malformation does Megan Fox have?","completion":"It’s quite possible she has ‘toe thumbs’.

At that time the new land was lush and green. Over the years, the climate changed and the land started drying out. The new arrivals used to regularly burn the undergrowth to flush out animals. That why we have a large number of tree and shrub types that can cope with fires that pass through quickly. Even though the tree may be blackened, it quickly starts to sprout new branches all over the tree. If the tree is fatally burnt, new shoots will come up from the root system. Some seeds will only sprout if they have been through a fire or exposed to smoke. It is also suspected that the very early Aboriginals killed off the giant wombats that used to roam around the country for thousands of years. They not only hunted but farmed the land in a sustainable way which would also have also changed the landscape.

Therefore, social sciences have to elicit knowledge while realizing the conditional nature of social phenomena.

Social sciences do apply scientific reasoning in terms of hypothesis development, data gathering, analysis and explanation. They do not offer Social laws because there are no apparent social laws. The reality is socially constructed and culture plays a role in our fragmented explication of the social phenomena. In this sense social sciences help humans adapt to this conditional nature.

He is widely known for his plays, novels, and stories; he was also an interesting poet and critic. As a critic, he wrote a monograph on Proust, and contributed to the symposium on Joyce’s work-in-progress that became Finnegans Wake. At one point, Beckett was Joyce’s secretary. Beckett began his career writing in English. In an effort to prune his work of rhetoric, he forced himself to write in French, and his most famous mature works were first written in French. He generally did the translations of his work back into English. (The translation of his novel Molloy was a collaborative effort by Becket and Patrick Bowles. Otherwise, Beckett seems to have done his translations alone.) Here is a selection of his major work. Plays Waiting for GodotEndgameKrapp’s Last Tape Short Stories More Pricks Than KicksFirst LoveStories and Texts for Nothing Novels Murphy (written in English)Watt (written in English)Molloy (written in French)Malone Dies (written in French)The Unnameable (written in French)How It Is (written in French) Criticism \\"Dante...Bruno.

That circuit will not support the two appliances in question. If two pairs of wires, then look at the built in copper or brass bridge that normally connects the upper and lower outlets. If that bridge is broken, the upper and lower are on their own circuit. You have a good likelihood the two appliances will work concurrently.

Is this borderline high?","completion":"A blood pressure reading of 138/83 falls within the prehypertension range. Prehypertension means that your blood pressure is slightly elevated but not yet considered high blood pressure. However, it's important to note that blood pressure can vary throughout the day, and a single reading may not provide a complete picture of your overall blood pressure health. A pulse rate of 52 beats per minute is generally considered within the normal range for adults, although it can vary depending on factors such as age, fitness level, and overall health. It's always a good idea to monitor your blood pressure regularly, and if you consistently have readings in the prehypertension range, it's worth discussing with a healthcare professional. They can help assess your overall health, consider any risk factors, and provide guidance on lifestyle modifications or further evaluation if needed.

Here’s what Jefferson Davis (considered a moderate) said in his speech retiring from the US Senate upon the secession of Mississippi (and eventually, of course, become the President of the CSA): He harkens back to the Revolutionary generation: “The communities were declaring their independence; the people of those communities were asserting that no man was born--to use the language of Mr. Jefferson--booted and spurred to ride over the rest of mankind; that men were created equal--meaning the men of the political community; that there was no divine right to rule; that no man inherited the right to govern; that there were no classes by which power and place descended to families, but that all stations were equally within the grasp of each member of the body-politic. These were the great principles they announced; these were the purposes for which they made their declaration; these were the ends to which their enunciation was directed. They have no reference to the slave; else, how happened it that among the items of arraignment made against George III was that he endeavored to do just what the North has been endeavoring of late to do--to stir up insurrection among our slaves? Had the Declaration announced that the negroes were free and equal, how was the Prince to be arraigned for stirring up insurrection among them? And how was this to be enumerated among the high crimes which caused the colonies to sever their connection with the mother country? When our Constitution was formed, the same idea was rendered more palpable, for there we find provision made for that very class of persons as property; they were not put upon the footing of equality with white men--not even upon that of paupers and convicts; but, so far as representation was concerned, were discriminated against as a lower caste, only to be represented in the numerical proportion of three fifths. Vice President of the CSA Alex Stephens: He harkens back to the great flaw in the Declaration of Independence - that it assumed that all men are created equal. “Those ideas, however, were fundamentally wrong. They rested upon the assumption of the equality of races. This was an error. It was a sandy foundation, and the government built upon it fell when the \\"storm came and the wind blew.\\" Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea; its foundations are laid, its corner-stone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal condition. This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth. This truth has been slow in the process of its development, like all other truths in the various departments of science. It has been so even amongst us. Many who hear me, perhaps, can recollect well, that this truth was not generally admitted, even within their day. The errors of the past generation still clung to many as late as twenty years ago. The southern rebellion wasn’t about ‘states rights’. Davis looking back said that the founding fathers knew that it was only white men that were supposed to be free. Stephens looked to the future that would show the moral and scientific FACT that slavery was the naturel place of the black race.

Studying hard. Like really, really, really hard, no matter how much \\"gifted\\" you are. And how parents support that. Being nerdy is a good thing in India. In my country the straight A's students were often mocked by their peers.Speaking several languages is a norm. This still fascinates me. Even though Slovakian language is almost same as Czech, I can't say I can speak it. I live by Polish border and surprise, I don't speak any Polish. In India how many languages you speak is not even a matter of education, it is just something normal. And yes, I know it relates mostly to local languages, but still. They are not the same languages necessarily.Family relationships are plain different, it brings many things I dislike, on the other hand some things which I like. For example a better position of elders in society and family. In western societies elders are not that much respected as in India and often are left to themselves in retirement. In India, it seems that they are being taken care of better and in their families.Helpful beyond (the western) norm. I can ask stranger on street to make a call and he will probably help me in India. I can ask for water. I can ask... Don't even try this in Europe, people will mostly just pass a weird look on you.Approach to food. What I appreciate is Indians prefer everything fresh. Freshest from fresh. Indians don't mind to spend a lot of time on preparing, buying, cooking and eating, food is a big priority. And shouldn't it be? Our body is our temple, we should take care of what we fuel it with. And those things hasn't changed much even with coming consumerism. Kudos and keep it! My country and me myself, are not flooded with processed food yet, however Indians take it to another level. Not only they regard to use fresh ingredients for cooking, they also don't like to store food too long. And that's was the learning point to me. When my Indian friends found out I am able to keep a box with a cooked meal in a fridge for three, four days and eat it continuously, they were shocked to disgusted :D.Friendship options/possibilities. Friendship in general is much broader concept for Indians than I am used to in my culture. This difference can even cause some international misunderstandings as per my experience. I have friends all over the world. Some of them are closer to me, some of them less. And in general, though I can be very friendly, I am not a person who enjoys daily communication with one person. It bothers me. Daily communication is for my family and my boyfriend, that's it. My best friends are people I meet once a month. And it is okay with me and them. It can turn into a major problem, when I try to explain to my Indian friend, that writing and calling me daily, hugging and touching me, taking me out for food often, taking care of me when I am ill etc is seen as being a boyfriend not as a friend here. That was the international example. Now, when I see friendships between Indians (especially boys) they are more like brothers often. My conclusion is that Indians are used to develop very intense and close relationships between friends to the extent where we see it as a role of a boyfriend/girlfriend. In my culture friends can do a lot for you, sure, but it is not expected, it is not a rule. Sometimes I feel that the friend love I have seen between Indians is simply missing here in my culture, or is very exceptional. We don't devote to friends so much. We expect our life partners to do so and that's why we expect everyone to get a life partner soon as well. Indians seems to take this part of life before wedding, and fill in all their needs by friends. We partly fill the social needs by friends and partly by dating someone for the \\"extra care\\". And I see quite a thick line between the relationship to my (best)friends, what I \\"sacrifice\\" to them, and to my boyfriend and what I do for him. I fail to see such difference in Indian friendshipsXdates. Correct me if I am wrong. To add one example - twice I was ill while living out of my parent's home. Even though I have close Czech friends, in the end it was always the Indian ones who cooked food for me and came to my place to see me. The Czech would come if I asked them, probably wouldn't cook for me. Indians do this automatically, offer me to come or surprise me.To some extent I like certain feminineness I see in Indian males. From my European perspective. They take care of their kids and show the love to them, they are more emotional and it is not considered to be bad. Be it your own child, or few weeks old cousin sister they are happy to show publicly their emotions for them. Also, as a girl who is not into action movies I liked that growing up with Bollywood, Indian boys are not ashamed to go to cinema for love and romantic movies, they don't try to build up their masculinity based on denying those movies. When I sum it up - Some behaviour and characteristics which are usually ascribed to women in Europe (and are seen as a weakness when associated with men) are not valid for Indians. Edit at 4.2k upvotes Notice: I don't want to cause dissapointment to those people who think I am in a blind love with India, however I only describe here, on Quora, what I have experienced, I answer what I was asked. The good as well as the bad.

Like you transformed every single thing. Even the seat covers and the nails for the wood etc. So the next ship that was constructed has all of those exact same pieces that the original ship had then anyone would believe that the newly constructed ship is the original ship if you really imagine it in that sense. But, the newly constructed ship can only be the original ship under the condition that it has the parts exactly in the same way like the sail should be positioned the same, the rooms should be at the same place and it should actually look exactly like the same ship then it IS the original ship. And what you did was actually just disassemble and reassemble it. This is a pretty challenging paradox as they get you into thinking about the new ship while all you did was just disassemble and reassemble it. So for example think about anything like that, you disassemble your phone or your chair, just anything, but when you reassemble it in the exact same way that it was before it remains the same thing right? That's exactly what's happening here. But there are some things after reassembling which they do not remain the same like in a human it's brain or dna (at a molecular level), in a car it's the chassis and engine and in a phone it's the motherboard. But if you replace everything of course it's not replacing because it does not have a soul or anything like that. So my conclusion is that the new ship assembled (if in the exact same way) is the original ship."},{"prompt":"f a job is still being advertised 4 months after you were rejected, and you think you are qualified for it, would you reapply?","completion":"It’s complicated.

This is a quick match-up of the highest percentage for each: Enneagram Type 1 - ISTJEnneagram Type 2 - ESFJEnneagram Type 3 - ESTJEnneagram Type 4 - INFPEnneagram Type 5 - INTPEnneagram Type 6 - ISXJEnneagram Type 7 - ENXPEnneagram Type 8 - EXTJEnneagram Type 9 - ISFP Since there are 16 MBTI types and only 9 Enneagram types, there’s a lot of potential overlapping. Here’s more information taken: “ESTP Personality Enneagram Type - If you are an ESTP, you are probably an Enneagram type 7, 3 or 8. As described previously, all three of those types are strongly correlated with extraversion. The most common type by far for an ESTP is Enneagram 7. The next most common categories are 8s and 3s. After that, Enneagram 6, which as noted earlier is actually more strongly correlated with introversion than extraversion, is not uncommon for an ESTP. 2, 4, 5 and 9 are also possibilities but would tend to occur in 1 out of 20 - 1 out of 30 cases (each).” ”ISTP Personality Enneagram Type - If you are an ISTP, you could be almost any Enneagram type but it’s Enneagram 5 that is the most common, representing 41% - 45% ISTPs Enneagram 6 is the next most common type at 12% to 15% of ISTPs. 7, 8 and 9 each range in the 8% - 12% range. 1 of 20 ISTPs are Enneagram type 3.” ”ISFP Personality Enneagram Type - ISFPs showed a broad distribution across many different Enneagram types. However, the two most common types are 4 or 9 which combined range from 51% - 69% of ISFPs. Other likely possibilities include 2, 6 and 5.” ”ESFP Personality Enneagram Type - ESFPs are broadly represented across many Enneagram types. The most common type is 7 at 31% to 44% of ESFPs. Enneagram 2, 6 and 9 are fairly common as well.” ”ISFJ Personality Enneagram Type - Most ISFJs are one of three types. 64% - 75% of ISFJs are either type 2, 6 or 9. 4s and 1s are relatively common. 3, 5, 7 and 8 are fairly uncommon.” ”ESFJ Personality Enneagram Type - If you’re an ESFJ, you are probably an Enneagram 2. 47% - 61% of the ESFJs fell into this category. Other very common types include Enneagram 2, 6 and 9.” ”ISTJ Personality Enneagram Type - 86% - 88%of ISTJs are split between three types 1, 5 and 6. This doesn’t seem unusual. The ISTJ “inspector” type is likely to be a 1. ISTJs are known for their loyalty that is common to Enneagram Type 6.” ”ESTJ Personality Enneagram Type - ESTJs are most often one of three types: Enneagram 3, 6 and 8. Enneagram 1 is not uncommon, representing 13% to 16% of ESTJs.” ”INTJ Personality Enneagram Type - 51% - 62% of INTJs are Enneagram 5s so when we are thinking of the common analytical INTJ stereotype, it is likely the INTJ Enneagram 5 which comes to mind. 1s are also fairly common, representing 10% - 14% of the INTJs. There was a notable difference in the percentage of INTJ Enneagram 6s on Typology Central (5%) vs. Personality Cafe (20%) which is unusual given the large numbers of them present on both sites. Enneagram 3, 4 and 8 occur somewhat frequently between 3% and 8% of the time.” ”ENTJ Personality Enneagram Type - ENTJs can be almost any type except for a 2 and were well represented across many Enneagram Types. There were a few that stood out. 32% - 46% of ENTJs are 8s and 19% - 26% were 3s. Both fit well with the ENTJ stereotype of the in-charge achiever. 1 was also fairly common, representing 10% - 11% of the population of ENTJs.” ”INTP Personality Enneagram Type - A whopping 68% - 74% of INTPs are Enneagram 5s. 4, 6 and 9 are the next most likely type but occur in 1 out of 10 to one of 20 cases.” ”ENTP Personality Enneagram Type - ENTPs are represented across all of the different Enneagram types but there are a few that stand out as more common. The most common type by far for ENTPs is Enneagram 7 at 47% of the ENTP members. Other common types included 3, 5 and 8 which range between 7% and 15% of ENTPs. On the lower side of frequency, you have about a 1 in 20 chance of being a 4, 6 or 9 as well.” ”INFJ Personality Enneagram Type - INFJs are also well represented across all of the Enneagram Types. By far the most common was the 4 at 44%. 14% were 5s, 11% were 9s, and 10% were 6s. 1s (6%) and 2s (7%) are not quite as common but there are plenty of them out there.” ”ENFJ Personality Enneagram Type - 42% of ENFJs are 2s. If we recall that 61% of ESFJs are 2s, it becomes clear that there is a definite correlation between Extraverted Feeling as a dominant function and the Enneagram Type 2. Enneagram types 3, 4 are also quite common, ranging from 11% to 18% of ENFJs. 1, 6, 7 and 9 are not uncommon as well but generally are present in lower percentages (4% to 9%).” ”INFP Personality Enneagram Type - By far the highest % of INFPs are Enneagram type 4, ranging between 42% and 57% of INFPs. This likely aligns with our most common stereotype for the INFP as someone who prides themselves on being different. 5s and 9s are also quite common ranging between 13% and 17% each. 2s and 6s, while not quite as common, represent between 5 and 11% of INFPs.” ”ENFP Personality Enneagram Type - It’s not common for an ENFP to be an Enneagram 1 or 5 but other than that, they are well represented across all of the Enneagram types. The largest number of ENFPs are 7s (between 33% and 39%). The second most common type is 4, representing 23 - 25% of ENFPs. The third most common type is 2, with between 11 and 17% of ENFPs falling into this category. 3s, 6s, and 9s are not entirely uncommon either, representing between 4% and 8% of ENFPs each. Again, when we recall that 47% of ENTPs are Enneagram 7, it appears there is a strong correlation between Extraverted Intuition as a dominant function and Enneagram 7.” This article is useful in breaking down the MBTI types and their possible Enneagram equivalents.

But on a neutral point of view by data you can say Bangladesh is currently in better position than Pakistan however comparing with the infrastructure and educational Institute you can easily come to a conclusion that Pakistan is far batter than Bangladesh.This is due to Pakistan has started its development ahead of Bangladesh and Bangladesh has to started its development after its liberation from pakistan. My consent is that the pace of development of Bangladesh is better than Pakistan.It's very obvious that Pakistan is at upper hand as they started their modernization earlier,on the contrary it’s quite evident that Bangladesh will be surpass Pakistan in near future as the data shows and every aspect of data remain same as now.

Many people are not compelled to give in to each and every physical desire immediately; they can employ discipline and wait a few hours. If they have a slow metabolism then eating once a day is probably enough. Intermittent fasting, or even proper fasting, has recently been shown to induce a process call autophagy, where old and tired cells actually start to repair themselves. This has incredibly promising implications, and could even help with staving off various cancers. You don't need to eat 5 times a day, eating less (providing your BMI is 19 or over) won't kill you."},{"prompt":"What was your reason for leaving a tremendous tip at a restaurant?","completion":"Is 25% tremendous? Or maybe 26%. That’s how much I tipped this year at a restaurant where we celebrated my husband’s birthday (party of 6) and our daughter’s 24th birthday (different restaurants). Both times, our party asked the server a lot of questions about the menu. Some were special requests (off menu) and none of those were honored, but still, the server had to listen to all of that and explain. Then, at both, I had brought a cake and each server cut, served, and re-boxed the cake. At one restaurant a tip of 18% was added for us, and at the other 20% was added. For each, I bumped the tip up to a little over 25%, because of how much work each server did and for how key they were in us having successful birthday dinners. Each restaurant charged a cake cutting fee (5, I think), or I would have tipped even more than I did. (And I appreciate the reasons for having that fee, btw). There is no way I could have pulled of a meal as nice as either of these by myself, even if enlisting family members to help. And most of our family have full-time jobs, so it was nice to go out and everybody just relax and enjoy. Thank you, servers of the world! PS - when I take a cake, and the server loses the box, making it difficult or impossible to take leftover cake home, I tip down just a little. But the box has been lost enough times that I remind them upfront now."},{"prompt":"Why was Michael Jordan not drafted #1 overall when he was clearly the best college player at the time?

It may seems silly, but I’ve found a familiarity with them can just make so many things easier and better understood.” Can You Write a Spec? “A spec is a simple document that describes how a technical product or feature should function and work. You do not need to have technical skills to write this document, but there are certain best practices in how you communicate product descriptions to engineers (who will build) that you should be aware of. Ask your friends who are product managers to share with you some specs they’ve written.” Basics of Analytics “Businesses run on numbers and online analytics just proves the point. You have to know the basics of how an analytics package functions, how to set it up correctly and how to act on the numbers it gives you. Otherwise, you’ll be operating blind.” Communicating via Social Media “Start basic. Have a good grasp on how to best utilize all the major social media networks, including Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, for business. Entrepreneurs need to know how to best communicate their ideas to a wide audience via social media and how to get feedback in the same manner.” Customer Acquisition “Sales solves a multitude of problems.

Dubai and Abu Dhabi have a separate visa and entry system from each other, with an Abu Dhabi tourist visa not being applicable in Dubai and vice versa. Therefore, while a person may be allowed to enter Dubai with an Abu Dhabi tourist visa, they may not be able to stay there or complete any of the required administrative procedures. It is recommended to contact the UAE embassy in the travelor's country of origin to get detailed information about the requirements and regulations for visiting Dubai or Abu Dhabi. Additionally, a person should always check the rules of the UAE Immigration Department and the Foreign Affairs Ministrys before they plan to visit the UAE."},{"prompt":"My family wants to put my cat down.

Depends on situation, if it is relatively old cat that has never been living outside and who’s chances for survival as a stray are minimal, and if owner has exhausted all options of finding a new home or foster home than, personally, I would not have a problem performing euthanasia (What is alternative, let the cat die slowly in agony caused by starvation, freezing, cat bite abscess and consequent systemic infection, being hit by car and dying for three days in excruciating pain or something similar?). Maybe the best option is to take the cat to local shelter, with professionals who will help you make the decision.

I'm sure everyone has heard this beautiful song on loop. It's from an old movie 'Kabhi Kabhie’ and the singer is Mukesh. That's all we have in that image, right? But that's not it. This song has the most beautiful lyrics. And it was written by a magnificent lyricist and poet of that time, Sahir Ludhianvi. But hardly anyone knows about him. Someone once passed a taunt to Sahir that your songs get hit because Lata Mangeshkar sings them. From then on, he refused to work with Lata Ji for almost two years until things got sorted. Sahir asked to have 1 Rs more salary than RD Burman, who took all the credit for the blockbuster songs. RD Burman was a great singer and composer of that time. Sahir said Burman can't get into the limelight if I don't write the songs well. And he had a point. Result, they never worked together afterwards. Sahir wasn't an ego-centric man. He wanted to be respected for what he did. Writing. He said all the lyricists should be paid more, because if there's no lyrics, there's no song. Here's the thing about writers. They are not heroes. People will run on the streets for an actor. People will run on the streets for a singer. But people won't run on the streets for a writer. Writing is heroic. Writers aren't. So if your sole motivation behind writing is to get fame, drop the pen right now. Maybe hold a guitar. Or buy yourself a cricket bat (if you're an Indian). Writing should be done only when you like transforming someone's tears into words and making them say, 'Oh, yes. That's exactly how I was feeling right now. Thanks for writing this.’ If you like showering a few sentences on paper that's chained inside someone's heart, for years, you're good. That's exactly what writers are there for. They make the pain bearable. They help you to survive a daily battle.

Not a chance. There’s a huge difference between organ and piano: organ keys are not touch-sensitive, and there’s no delay. The sound continues as long as the note is held, and it doesn’t matter how you press the note; the sound is the same. The release becomes as important as the attack. Add to that the complexity of the registration (which levers and stops do I use, and how does that affect the sound?), and the multiple manuals (keyboards) on the organ. And no sustain pedal to cover up your sloppy legato. Better get good at changing fingers on one note to sustain legatos. Oh, and there are pedals. Lots of ‘em. You have to play notes with your feet in addition to your hands. A pianist is going to have an easier time learning the organ than someone who has never touched a piano, but they are different instruments, requiring different skills"},{"prompt":"What is the cheapest country to visit from India?","completion":"Hello Everyone, Traveling is not only an exciting experience, but also an enrichment of life.

However, it is unlikely that Node.js will replace all backend technologies, as different technologies are better suited for different types of applications and use cases. Node.js is particularly well-suited for building real-time applications that require high levels of concurrency, such as chat applications or real-time collaboration tools. It is also well-suited for building microservices-based architectures, where small, independent services communicate with each other to perform different tasks. However, Node.js may not be the best choice for certain types of applications, such as applications that require heavy computation or that need to perform complex queries on large datasets. In these cases, other technologies such as Java, Python, or C# may be more suitable. Overall, it is likely that Node.js will continue to be a popular choice for building certain types of backend applications, but it is unlikely to completely replace all other backend technologies."},{"prompt":"Why does this generation have a lot of depressed people?","completion":"Because they have correctly deduced that the world is going to hell in a handbasket and that their lives are going to be very difficult as a result of the selfishness of previous generations."},{"prompt":"Should we boot Turkey out of NATO for playing silly games regarding the acceptance of Sweden as a NATO member?

Climate change is a long & and invisible until the consequences become rampant & too evident (like right now!) process, and of course the ultimate reason is humans. We have destroyed the natural vegetation by unchecked usage of natural resources but never did we really focus on regeneration. Due to climate change, deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common. Increased warming in the Arctic has contributed to melting permafrost, glacial retreat, and sea ice loss. Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes. Newer & innovative measures need to be thought about & implemented, climate change is an urgency that we all must halt and understand."},{"prompt":"What's it like being a Slider, a person whose energy effects electronic equipment by making it shut down, malfunction or go haywire?","completion":"Question: What's it like being a Slider, a person whose energy effects electronic equipment by making it shut down, malfunction or go haywire? I’d never heard of the term “Slider” in this context before today, but I live with one: my wife. Initially we both thought it was just a coincidence and laughed at how often my computers would misbehave when she is near, but it has just happened so often it is beyond coincidence. This effect isn’t usually severe, I don’t always get a shutdown, system crash, or haywire, but web sites can simply refuse to load, applications may freeze, or the mouse/keyboard suddenly decides it needs a short rest. At the very least, my internet speed will drop from its usual 75:20 mbps to something akin to the speeds I used to get from a 56K dial-up modem. At first we laughed, “it can’t be real, right?” or “Dammit! You’re witching my PC again!” and we would struggle along until things eventually worked. But then I started asking Sue to leave the room on some pretence: “Any chance of a cup of tea while I do this?”, “can you just check the mileage on your car for this form please?”, “would you mind just going downstairs and grabbing the letter we received about this?” and, as soon as she left, whatever I was trying to do would go smoothly. That’s still just a co-incidence right? Until we noticed just how often we were hearing apologies elsewhere, ”Oh, I am so sorry, I just don’t know what’s wrong with this thing. It was fine a minute ago!”, when a store EPoS (electronic til) or store computer would “play up”. So now we just accept it and when Sue is having one of her ‘High Radiation’ days or moods she simply stays away from computing tech as much as possible. Sue has little interest in owning a computer, but did manage to use an old laptop of mine for occasional web-searches. In the end though, it generally took so long to get a result she decided to revert to her “voice activated tablet and desktop”. Apparently these voice-activated devices are not uncommon (I’m not referring to to Siri, Alexa or hey-Google) I think the two here are both of the HoneyDo brand: “Honey, will you do some online shopping and order these plants for me?” or “Honey can you do an email for me?”. Thankfully it ONLY seems to be computers and it seems to be very short range. The quartz watches work perfectly, as does the car and anything else electrical around the house…. though Sue does seem to suffer more lock-ups and freezes in the satellite TV box than I do. But if I am looking something up for her on the ‘net or similar, she will either wander off for 10 minutes, or will stand well back from the desk. I would seriously love to know what it is, but it has now happened so many times I simply cannot accept it is just pure dumb luck or coincidence."},{"prompt":"What would you do if one of your bridesmaids didn't like the dress you have chosen for her?","completion":"Well… I'm not a woman I can't answer this question."},{"prompt":"Could Data pass the Kobayashi Maru in Star Trek?","completion":"Well, the Kobayashi Maru is designed to be a no-win scenario, so technically, no one can pass it.

One way is to use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms. In this case, the first term is 1, the last term is 10, and there are 10 terms. So, the sum is equal to (1 + 10)/2 * 10 = 55. Another way to calculate 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 quickly is to use the \\"casting out nines\\" method. This method is based on the fact that the sum of the digits of any number that is divisible by 9 is also divisible by 9. In this case, the sum of the digits of 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 is 45, which is divisible by 9. So, we know that 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 is also divisible by 9. Since the sum of a multiple of 9 and another multiple of 9 is also a multiple of 9, we know that 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 is equal to 9 times some number. We can then divide 45 by 9 to get 5, which is the answer. Finally, we can also use a calculator to calculate 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10. This is the most straightforward method, but it may not be the quickest if you are not familiar with the calculator."},{"prompt":"What are some little known benefits to leasing a vehicle rather than purchasing?","completion":"Getting behind the wheels of an exotic car is a dream come true for many.

In Punjab Akali Dal and Congress ruled over last 20 years but sadly Punjab did not see any development. Its a state with very good education facilities but no jobs and no private sector industry , this is contradictory in itself, the reason is politicians of both Akali i.e. Badal family and Congress the Amarinder Singh family have only been doing corruption and not bringing any benefit to Punjab . Congress understood the problem way back in 2017 itself and hence roped in Sidhu but Congress could not come out of grasp of Amarinder Singh who kept corruption on going and failed at attracting industry in Punjab. Hence he was replaced. Bust most people who supported Akali are fed up with Akali Dal corruption and are moving to Aam Aadmi Party. Those who supported Congress and feel frustrated that Congress did not do much are also going to AAP. This is the reason AAP is growing so much. Second reason is that Punjabis always look upto Delhi , it can be said Delhi is also part of Punjabi cultural influence and when they see AAP is doing very well in Punjab, the support for AAP in Punjab increases.

When she was 19 years old she worked in a retail store with a married man named Rick, she was dating a man named Mike. This was during her first year of college. She cheated on Mike with Rick and got pregnant. Her and Rick made the decision not to break up Rick’s marriage so she told Mike it was his child. Between the two, Mike was the better catch financially as he had a superior job, and owned a nice home. So, Mike, being an honorable man, did the right thing and he married her. He love the child, and he loved Sue with all his heart. She on the other hand always held a candle for Rick. And after 6 years of marriage she began a second affair with Rick, and asked Mike for a divorce. By this time she had her name of all of poor Mikes assets and in the divorce got half his house. Then her and Rick moved in together and she got a thousand dollars a month in child-support for six year old junior. Her and Rick lived high on the hog, they ate out 3 nights a week, went on vacations, they each owned brand new cars. She has a good job, Rick not so much. Then after 6 years, she got a new job and it required her to move across the country. She was about to move away and continue taking Mike’s 1,000 mo. with her. Well, her best girl-friend had a heart and felt bad for the poor guy. Who drove an old beat up rusty car, and was clearly not living as high as Sue & Rick. So she went and spilled the beans to Mike and told him that the now 12 year old child was not his, but was Ricks! Mike took a paternity test and it proved the friends words true. He went to court and got the child support discontinued. He still loved Sue so he never outed her or shamed her. Everyone still thinks the child is his, and Rick is the step-father. He is still in the child’s life as if nothing changed, he loves the child as if he were his own. He never brought up the six years of child-support he paid after the divorce for a child that was not his ~ 72,000.00 she and Rick took from him. He’s such a good man. Too good! Oh, but Grandpa & Grandma are NOT HAPPY with what transpired! So, they are going to make sure justice prevails in this situation. So, they modified their will to state that when Sue receives her piece of their estate, she must pay Mike 72,000.00 off the top of her money (even if that means she get zero). The ironic part is, she doesn’t even realize they know about the true paternity of their grandchild. Sue thinks it’s all under wraps.

Why is turning a profit on ownership not a good thing?","completion":"Did you add value? That seems to be the real question. It’s fair to collect profit if you’ve added value to a thing. My understanding of the use of the term in the 1780s (the “On the wealth of nations” era of economics) was that landholders didn’t add value to their land, but by renting the land, instead of selling it, the landlord continued to extract (extort) value from the producer and the customer. Smith was also using the labor theory of value to establish a justification for price - the ‘correct’ price was the cost of inputs + a little profit. Ideally, the profit would be squeezed out by market forces. The Marginal revolution, of course, rearranged the terms of value by denying that there was a ‘correct’ cost for anything. Do you have a bar of gold? It’s only worth what the people with money will give you for it. If all the people with money decide that it’s worth 2, then … THAT IS THE PRICE OF A BAR OF GOLD. That’s wacky, right ? Most people who aren’t selling things prefer the Adam Smith / Inputs / labor theory of value. Most people who don’t actually make stuff prefer the marginal theory of value because it doesn’t require them to do anything.

Type of Materials Some welding filler materials are designed to produce welds that are stronger than the base material. For instance, certain high-strength filler materials can create welds that have higher tensile strength than the base metal. Welding Process The welding process used can also affect the strength of the weld. Some processes, like Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) welding or Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW), also known as MIG welding, can produce very strong welds if done correctly. Joint Design The design of the joint can influence the strength of the weld. For example, a properly designed and executed fillet weld or groove weld can often carry more load than the base material. Skill of the Welder The skill of the welder plays a critical role in the strength of the weld. A skilled welder who properly prepares the joint, selects the right filler material, and uses the right welding technique can produce a weld that's stronger than the base material. However, it's important to note that just because a weld can be stronger than the base material, it doesn't mean that it always is or should be. Depending on the application, it may be more important for the weld to have similar properties to the base material (like ductility or resistance to cracking) than to have higher strength. Additionally, a weld that's much stronger than the base material can lead to problems, because it can cause the base material to fail around the weld if the joint is subjected to high loads. In real-world applications, engineers aim for a balance where the welded joint is as strong as necessary, but also has the right properties for the application. This might involve choosing a filler material that matches the base material, designing the joint properly, and using the right welding process and technique.

Kids can be mean."},{"prompt":"What are your late growth spurt stories?","completion":"Left: 18 years old and only driven by money Right: 23 years old and almost completely driven by happiness I honestly can’t believe that these two people are the same person. Not necessarily in appearance, but in the outlooks on life and the world in general. At age eighteen… My state in life when the first picture was taken was one where I was as ready as ever to get into real estate (I’d just finished my licensing exams when I was 17), and my mission in life was to make as much money as possible. My goals included trading in real estate both as an agent and an investor, buying expensive clothes just for the bragging rights, getting my hands on the most badass Cadillac Escalade, and living in a sprawling mansion somewhere in Rancho Santa Fe. Gordon Gekko was my role model, I’d never been outside of Canada and the US (and had no interest in going elsewhere), and having just gotten out of a relationship a few months earlier, had no belief in love and convinced myself that I’d be a regular sugar daddy to the “inevitable” swarm of women who would come to me as a rich guy. Kind of contrary to this, I lived a highly frugal life, trying to keep money together for the sake of “building a foundation” that I could become wealthy off of. I was conditioned to earning about 9.00 CAD per hour working in a call centre for most of ages 16 and 17. So I’d do crazy things to hoard money. Making coffee at home instead of buying it on my way to work. Not eating lunch. Having an extremely basic cell phone plan. My logic was “I’ll save for today so I can put it to the best use to be enjoyed in the future.” The biggest change in my thinking was my realization that “the future” is bullshit. It may or may not exist. But regardless, why am I sacrificing myself today to possibly enjoy myself later on? You only live once - and if you’re going to be making yourself miserable on purpose because you think that’s going to make you enjoy yourself some years from now, you’re not living. You’re giving up a good today to possibly have a good tomorrow. As soon as I realized that it’s fully within my capability to enjoy myself today, and sustainably keep that enjoyment going indefinitely, that is when I began to enjoy life. I’d buy coffee, I’d go out for lunch, I’d get my hair cut every 10 days because it makes me feel good, I’d travel places I couldn’t actually afford to because I want to see more of the world. Every day I live is a page in my story. Do I really want whole chapters of my story to be miserable because “I was hoping it would get better later”? Give me a break! In the five years that elapsed from the time that first photo was taken, a ridiculous amount of things changed. In summary, those include… Getting into and out of real estate, realizing I’d put far too much stock into embracing a line of work I actually knew very little about, and that the constant stress, perpetual involvement in deals, and the amount of liability that rests on my shoulders just isn’t a way for me to live my life.Meeting my first true love on Saturday, November 26th, 2011. We didn’t work out, but the magnitude of emotions I only knew how to feel because of her made me see everything differently. Up until that point, I didn’t believe in love. But because of her, love existed to me. Love made sense. Love was something I could feel and enjoy. And because of that, I knew that love was one of my goals. If I had to, I would have given up literally every single thing in my life for her - and I’d never felt that strong of a feeling before. Suddenly the wisdom of “love is more important than money” didn’t sound so hokey to me.Going back to school, despite leaving high school when I was 16. I went to college as a mature student, and then to university in the UK to finish off a BA. This exposed me to a lot of things and a lot of people, and got me into my first “real job”.Finding my desire for travel. At the time the second picture was taken, I’d been to 14 different countries and flown over 100,000 km. Much of this was inspired by living in Italy for a summer while I was in school, and then in England for my final year. That year consisted of many trips to many places that opened my eyes and grew my hunger to explore.Speaking of that “real job”, I got a sense of what traditional adult-ing is. For so many grads, the 9–5 job with salary, benefits, a desk, and your inner circle at the office is an absolute dream. For me, it was a nightmare. Waking up early, rush hour, office politics, and highly mundane work made me feel like nothing more than a resource with an employee number. Now, don’t get me wrong. I absolutely fancied getting over 1,200 after taxes deposited into my bank account every two weeks, considering how I earned less than 250 per week after taxes in my call centre job (just over a third of my “real job” income). But all it really was is selling part of my life for money. That is, I’ve got 168 hours in a week. I’ll take 40 of them and decide to sell them to my employer every week in exchange for x amount of dollars. It just made me wonder, “is this it?”. Is this what adults do with their lives? Sign away 40 hours per week plus your long-term freedom in exchange for x amount of dollars? What kind of life is that to live, whether you earn 1,200 every two weeks or 10,000 every two weeks? No matter how much you bring home at the end of the day, you’re a resource at worst, and a slave at best.I’d quit that job shortly before the second picture was taken. My outlook on life was very different, with the mentality that there’s so much more to be done with life than just working hard and getting paid.Above all, something that changed me was realizing what it’s like to make a LOT of money. I won’t say exactly what things I was doing, but I had gotten into a few ventures that ended up paying exceptionally well for me (multiples more than what a 20-something would typically be earning). By my money-hungry standards, I’d made it. But something was missing. No matter how many fancy garments I owned, or how much steak I ate, I just felt as though I wasn’t fully enjoying myself. Was I buying those clothes because I liked them? Was I eating steak because it’s my favourite thing? Or was I doing those things because it made me feel rich and superior? I lied to myself and tried to persuade myself that “only these brands will do”, and “of course steak is my favourite food”. But deep down, I knew the truth. There’s so much more to what life has to offer than the most expensive and the most glamorous. It all comes down to what makes you truly happy. My definition of this will never truly be “final”. But being able to afford literally anything I wanted taught me that money was not my ceiling of fulfillment. It’s something much deeper, much less finite, and much more qualitative. At age twenty three… At this point, the only extent to which I cared about money was one where it could sustain me and make me happy. What I was really after was along the lines of travel, experiences, general happiness, and a circle of friends to enjoy things with. That is where being interesting, nice, personable, and sociable comes into play. There’s a fixed amount of money in the world. But an unlimited amount of happiness. The only issue is that most happiness is hidden and invisible to people. I’m glad that I know how to see it now, and that I realize the importance so that I can be happy today, and continue to be happy in the future - if that time ever does come. As for what I’m doing now (which is basically the same thing as when the picture was taken, as I just turned 24 two weeks ago), I’m doing freelance work that does not compromise my freedoms and my ability to be happy. I’ll sleep in most days, go out for coffee most mornings with a notebook to just think, and either indulge in, or think of ways to indulge in various forms of happiness - whether myself, or with friends. I’m confident that I’m in a place now where I’d be just as happy with 0 in the bank, as I would be with 10 MM in the bank. That took a great many experiences to realize. But I’m glad that I can constantly feel as though I’m at my 100%, and not at the mercy of the force of greed that weighed me down for so long. With the mentality shift from “I don’t have what I need yet” to “I have everything I need and anything else is a bonus”, I think that the change in facial expressions explains itself. Back then, I felt empty, and it showed. But now, I’m as full as can be, and only getting fuller."},{"prompt":"Scottish whisky better than American whiskey?

First of all, you would most likely notice the brake failure pretty quickly while backing out of the parking spot or driveway or at least before you get to a significant speed. Depending on the car, you will likely get a brake warning light on the dash too. I noticed that the brakes weren’t working a few feet after backing out of the parking spot at the apartment complex that this happened at and simply used the E brake to stop and pulled back into the parking spot. But let’s say somehow you didn’t notice that the brakes weren’t working until you are up to highway speeds. Definitely a scary situation, but remember that you still have the E brake and engine to stop you. Downshifting to the lowest gear you can without exceeding redline and continuing to downshift as you slow down while simultaneously using the E brake will actually typically stop a car at a decently short amount of time. Just remember to apply the E brake carefully and gradually because applying it too quickly and aggressively will lock up the rear wheels, possibly causing you to lose control. If the wheels lock up, hold the steering wheel straight and release the E brake a bit until the wheels are rolling again. The idea is to use the E brake as hard as possible without locking up the tires. Electronic parking brakes will often do this automatically, but manual parking/emergency brakes can lock the tires up if applied too hard. It’s actually a good idea to carefully practice engine braking and using the E brake to stop without using the brakes in a safe place (not a busy road) before you end up in a situation where you lose your brakes and have to quickly try to figure this out right then and there. Knowing how to downshift and about how hard you can apply the E brake without locking the tires up could save you and other drivers from serious injury and a lot of damage if your brakes ever fail. Just don’t use the E brake for more than about 5 seconds at a time while practicing because it can overheat and suffer damage if it’s overused."},{"prompt":"Which is the best car in India under Rs 5 lakh in 2020?","completion":"There are few good options like Tata Punch and Mahindra XUV 300 are available in the market under 10 lakhs.

Initially Will Smith was laughing. He later saw that his wife felt uncomfortable. Hence Will Smith got up and he slapped Chris Rock. After slapping him, he went back to the seat and he yelled at Chris Rock like anything by saying to keep his wife's name away from his mouth. It is said that Will Smith's wife Jada Pinkett is suffering from disease and hence she had shaved her hair. Based on that, Chris Rock was making a joke. Initially when I saw him beating, I thought it was staged but after when I saw him yelling at Chris Rock with very bad vulgar words, I was like this person has lost his cool entirely.

Here are ten common investment options to consider, but it's important to conduct thorough research and possibly consult a financial advisor before making any investment decisions: Stock Market:[LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #UgpJr] Investing in individual stocks or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) allows you to own a share of a company. Stocks have the potential for high returns, but they also carry higher risks.Bonds: Bonds are debt securities issued by governments or corporations. They generally offer lower returns compared to stocks but are considered more stable. They are often used to diversify a portfolio and provide income.Mutual Funds: Mutual funds pool money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. They offer diversification without requiring extensive research on individual assets.Real Estate: Investing in real estate involves buying properties to generate rental income or capital appreciation. Real estate can provide steady income and potential tax benefits.Index Funds: These funds track a specific market index, such as the S&P 500. They offer broad market exposure and tend to have lower fees compared to actively managed funds.Retirement Accounts[LINKED_TEXT: [2]] [URL: #tzQjt]: Contributing to retirement accounts like 401(k)s or IRAs can provide tax advantages and help secure your financial future.Dividend Stocks: These are stocks that pay regular dividends to shareholders. They can provide a source of passive income while still benefiting from potential capital appreciation.Peer-to-Peer Lending: This involves lending money to individuals or businesses through online platforms. It can offer higher returns than traditional savings accounts but carries higher risk.Cryptocurrencies: Digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have gained popularity as speculative investments. However, they are highly volatile and should be approached with caution.Commodities: Investing in commodities like gold, oil, or agricultural products can provide a hedge against inflation and diversify your portfolio. Remember, diversification is key to managing risk. It's wise to spread your investments across different asset classes to mitigate the impact of any single investment's poor performance. Additionally, your investment choices should align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor an investment strategy to your specific needs and circumstances.

If they died there would be no change seen in the world. Their life means nothing. Market makers and money managers are up with the architects of society, but they ain’t traders.

This is somewhat simplified, but for the most part the moderates are much more willing to compromise and reach across the aisle (often agreeing to more spending that way), while conservatives are anxious about the deficit and try to cut federal funding. Moderates tend to make up the idea of the “establishment” (again, tend to - I’ll get to the glaring exception later), while conservatives are the firebrands going against the establishment. In the 1950s, conservative Republicans blew their stack when President Eisenhower (a moderate Republican) failed to balance the budget. Fiscal responsibility was a backbone to what Sen. Barry Goldwater stood for when he ran for president in 1964, lambasting the growing size of the federal government and federal economy under President Johnson - but Goldwater lost in a landslide. Nixon was a moderate, which is why his government was willing to spend more money on things such as environmental measures, but Reagan was a conservative (recall his famous speech in favor of Goldwater that launched his political career) and cut funding to many government programs. H.W. Bush was moderate, but tried to paint himself as conservative, ending with some wishy-washy “read-my-lips” fiscal stuff. In the 1990s, part of why the Republicans were able to take Congress for the first time in decades was an effort spearheaded by conservative Republican Rep. Newt Gingrich to paint President Clinton as someone who didn’t care about balancing the federal budget or ending the deficit. However, his union with the 1996 Republican Party standard bearer, Sen. Bob Dole, was always flimsy at best - Gingrich was a conservative, Dole was moderate. Perhaps if Gingrich had answered the calls to run for office, did so in 1996, and somehow beat Clinton, a hypothetical Gingrich administration would have made fiscal policy a big part of its to-do list. Either way, Dole lost. George W. Bush was a moderate, so, like Nixon, his administration did spend a lot of money - especially on the Iraq War and the military. It was the 2010, 2012, and 2014 midterm elections during Obama’s presidency where things really got interesting. Tea Party candidates were definitely more conservative than moderate and seemingly more concerned about the deficit than anyone. Think of Sen. Rand Paul, Sen. Mike Lee, Sen. Ted Cruz, Rep. Mark Meadows, and many others. However, though some Tea Party candidates ran in 2016, a fiscal moderate won the Republican nomination. Yes, despite all of the rhetoric, and his anti-establishment credentials, Donald Trump is technically a moderate Republican, and his administration reflects this by spending billions on the military, global initiatives (like the ones in favor of decriminalizing homosexuality and promoting female leadership). This spending has been reflected in a big, fat, Obama-style price tag. So, TL;DR, at least since WWII, moderate Republicans (Eisenhower, Nixon, Bush Sr., Bush Jr., Trump) are less afraid to spend federal money than conservative Republicans (Goldwater, Reagan, Gingrich, Paul, Lee, Cruz) - but you’ll notice that the moderate Republicans tend to be the ones who run for/win the highest office in the land."},{"prompt":"Which 10 things should we stay away from in life?","completion":"MASTURBATION : A DEEP INSIGHT TO THIS NEFARIOUS ACTIVITY. IMPORTANCE OF CELIBACY. Hello Everyone , Today I want to tell you about The Vice of Masturbation and the Importance of Celibacy. Brahmacharya lifestyle has become a necessity of today's generation because It is digging own grave by falling prey to lust. Masturbation has become a demon who is constantly consuming the time and energy of Today's Youth. I have done an extensive research on this topic. Therefore I can answer this question. But before knowing about Brahmacharya , let us begin with some knowledge Masturbation. We all are humans . We all have to obey the laws of nature . Kindly understand that Sex and Masturbation are two different activities. Their is a lot of difference between them. Sex is a natural activity while Masturbation is unnatural activity ( That is the reason you feel ashamed of yourself after masturbating) Nature has created each organ of our body with a specific purpose. The purpose of Penis is to be involved in coitus with a female in order to sustain life further through the process of Reproduction. The disastrous effects of Masturbation : Weak bones , Pains all over the body and loss of confidence and concentration.Weak eyesight. Inferiority complex and lack of will to enjoy life.Anxiety issues and depression. Excessive Sleeping habits develop as you start remaining tired.Back pain and leg pain become extremely common.Digestive system becomes weak and slowly your whole body becomes weak . You will have no Desire to work or study and life will start becoming a burden on you.Frequent nightfall will be a common phenomenon.Believe me , The more you Masturbate the more your lust will increase. You will be struck in this vicious circle and find no way out of coming through it. This will only lead to frustration and irritation.There are many more disastrous effects of Masturbation .Mentioning all of them isn't possible. Why this happens ? Kindly know About The Seminal energy Semen is the most precious element in our body .It takes 30 to 35 days for the formation of sperms .According to ayurveda It is the last dhatu formed from the food cycle . It is formed in the following way: Rasa~> Rakt~> Manss~> Medh ~>Asthi~> Majja~> Shukra (Semen) Hence It can be vividly deduced that how important is semen. That is why if it's wasted by the disastrous activity of Masturbation , the above mentioned results will be seen. Not Only this , the Knowledgeable sages have even warned against excessive sex. Leave aside Masturbation as it is extremely awful activity. Semen Retention or Brahmacharya : Lord Mahavira , the 24th Jain Tirthankar included Celibacy or Brahmacharya as the 5th Mahavrat in Jainism. The other four being Satya , Asteya , Ahinsa and Aparigraha. Kindly understand that Buddha and Mahavira were Enlightened People . This clearly indicates the importance of Celibacy in life. In our success , brahmacharya plays an important role . The seminal energy we save through celibacy is diverted towards our brain to become OJAS, the divine energy Which can even activate the 7 chakras if practised for 12 years. Persistent celibacy helps us to achieve our goals easily. Celibacy helps in the holistic development of Human beings. However, it is not possible for commoner to do this. So, one shall try to follow as much celibacy as possible. Today's Modern world in which we are living is full of materialistic things and we easily loose our focus and become easy prey to lust . The best solution for this is to follow as such Celibacy as possible. This is specifically extremely beneficial for Students and teenagers who are generally suffering from Hormonal disbalance. It will help them to focus on studies and their goals. Celibacy keeps the person happy, healthy ,boosts his intelligence and provides him divine wisdom. One remains calm and mirthful. And encounters all the trials and tribulations of life easily. How long to follow Celibacy to see a change ? After following 30 days of celibacy, Not much will change . But you will see a change in your concentration and excitement levels . You will become happier and relaxed. Real change will be observed after 6 months .This has also been my personal experience As I have practiced celibacy for 8 months and observed many positive changes such as increase in wisdom thought intellect and confidence. When you begin , Celibacy will be tough to maintain , however once you follow celibacy for 2 months it becomes easier further. Celibacy has the potential to change your lives both materially and spiritually.Although we all know that how we feel guilty after masturbation and how we become lethargic. Because we have wasted our super seminal energy. Hence one shall try to maintain and follow Brahmacharya lifestyle . Advantages of Celibacy : Increased concentration , boost in physical and mental health.Increase in valour and charm of the face , evergreen youth and glittering eyes.A boost in will power and you will be able to give your 100% to achieve your goal.Memory Power will increase. For students preparing for exams such has UPSC , you already know how important is memory.Peace of mind and happiness . Cheerful mood all the time . No excessive worry of future. No Anxiety issues.Improved digestive system and holistic development of health and mind.Rise in intellectual abilities. You will be able to understand nature and life deeply.The list is very long. So kindly spare me to add more. Nightfall: Nightfall happens during our Sleep due to dreams full of lust and sexual unions. It is nothing but the side effects of masturbation. Remember when you had your first Nightfall ! You must have masturbated some time back or day back before that ! May be it was your first mistake while discovering about Sex after Puberty. But Remember that Man is the one who learns from his mistakes done in the past. Start following Celibacy and Nightfall will stop by its own. Science vs Experience : I know Some people will consider this Article thrash as they haven't seen any side effects of Masturbation in their own body and Probably have a Scientific approach to life.Let me tell you that I am from Science Background . But please don't fall prey to those doctors who say Masturbation is perfectly healthy activity and Semen Retention will cause Prostrate cancer ! They don't even know what they are saying. Remember that Science works on experiment What will you do if after 10 years Scientists and Doctors start claiming that Masturbation is dangerous activity ? Then will you start crying? Ask any older family members about Masturbation ( Don't Shy away ) They will always advise you to never waste Seminal energy. Just Think that one drop of Semen Consists of millions of Sperm. Each Sperm is capable of giving birth to a new life. Swami Vivekananda , Dayanand Saraswati , Bhagat Singh , Paramhansa , Mahatma Gandhi, Bal Gangadhar Tilak , Subhas Chandra Bose and all the noble souls were born from a single Sperm that had successfully fertilised the egg cell. You are sensible enough to Realise the importance of Seminal energy. Reason for Failure of Science to Gather Clear Proof : Their is a reason for this. Every body is built differently , Some have low body immunity and Some are naturally strong. It is possible that someone Masturbates frequently and doesn't experience too many side effects but in his heart of hearts he knows what he has lost ! While their are many people who have clearly mentioned that they have experienced the above mentioned effects of Masturbation and how this activity has Destroyed their life . I challenge everyone to follow Celibacy for 1 month and observe the changes in your physical and mental abilities. You will never regret it. Additional Information : You can start watching Manthan Hub YouTube channel to know deeply about Celibacy and the disastrous effects of Masturbation.( The channel has mentioned Scientific approach and experimental proof of Celibacy )Read Books about Brahmacharya . They are easily available on Internet. They are extremely good and provide deep insight about Celibacy.Getting up early in the morning and Practicing Meditation will help you in Following Celibacy. How to start doing Brahmacharya : Get up early morning before SunriseEat a balanced diet of sattvik foodEat less spicy food and Don't eat late at nightExercise daily.Drink water often.Keep yourself busy and involved.Do meditation.Focus on your Goal. I hope my penmanship has helped you in understanding the greatness of Celibacy . Talking about Celibacy in such brief way is impossible as it is a vast subject. You can message me if you need any help. THANKYOU.

The main rebuttal to the most popular answer here is that the fetus is generally arrived by conscious, consenting activities of the host.

However, to stand out to employers, they should be unique in their own way. Here are certain basic points you can use as a reference while drafting the best IIT resume. 1. Categorization A best IIT resume must have key qualifications and competencies categorized well into sections. Headlines may be like academic qualifications, scholastic achievements, internship and research projects, technical skills, work experience, extracurricular etc. Do not overload your resume by accommodating more information. Know that simple things gain more attention. So, format your resume accordingly. 2. Length of a resume It is okay if your resume is somewhat lengthy. Keeping things simple has nothing to do with having a 3-page resume. Just make sure that you do not describe a particular topic too much. If you have more experience working as an IITian or many essential skills that you cannot skip, then it is better to mention those points. The ideal number of pages of a resume should not exceed 2 pages but again, it varies from individual to individual. 3. Strategy to hide weak areas It is quite acceptable that you may have certain weak points in your resume. Disguising them is your task. You must present your resume in such a manner that only highlights your expertise and draws less attention to your weak spaces. Let's say, you have a poor GPA in a particular educational qualification, you can leave that part and instead display your activities, papers, awards etc. Alternatively, you can talk about your major GPA that may get the interviewer to overlook other minor GPAs. 4. Use some colours Using some colours like green or blue to get the headlines noticeable is one criterion of a good resume. This same rule also applies to IITians. Since there may be a lot of qualifications, achievements and awards, it becomes necessary to look out for ways that can grab attention. Using colours and different fonts will certainly make the resume appealing. However, do not use too many colours as you don't want to create a rainbow out of a resume. Other than white for the background, the secondary colour should be black and for emphasis, you can use blue or green. Also, use bold fonts where needed. Italics are also fine to break away from the monotonous font that is generally used. 5. Other interests You may choose to add to the \\"Other interests\\" section of your resume where you will be highlighting your hobbies or other recreational activities. Although it is a norm to include this section at the end of the resume, it is not the least that you can mention. This part helps connect with your recruiter on a personal level. Besides, your hobbies will be highly regarded if they coincide with promoting awareness and welfare like recycling items or working for animal rights etc. Apart from analytical traits, you can also show your creative abilities like painting, story writing etc through the \\"other interests\\" section. I hope this answer helps you in drafting the best resume as an IITian. Keep your fingers crossed as your interviewer might hire you based on the fact that your resume crafting skills are extraordinary."},{"prompt":"w often is a calculator used in pure math?","completion":"I will turn to a Python interpreter or Wolfram Alpha before I turn to a calculator."},{"prompt":"w much money can you make online?","completion":"Start a money-making blog in 4 steps If you have basic writing skills, a topic you love and the ability to work for a time without seeing any reward, blogging might be a good way to make money.

Cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, have seen significant price appreciation since their creation, and have the potential to provide a hedge against inflation because their supply is limited. However, cryptocurrencies are also highly speculative and volatile investments, with prices that can fluctuate rapidly. This means that investors can experience significant losses just as easily as they can experience significant gains. It's important to thoroughly research and understand the risks involved in investing in cryptocurrencies before making a decision. This includes understanding how cryptocurrencies work, the technology behind them, and the regulatory environment in which they operate. Only invest money that you can afford to lose, and consider diversifying your investment portfolio by investing in a mix of different assets, including traditional investments such as stocks, bonds, and real estate. Additionally, it's a good idea to keep up-to-date with the latest developments in the cryptocurrency market and to seek the advice of a financial advisor before making any investment decisions. They can provide guidance on whether investing in cryptocurrencies is appropriate for you and help you develop a well-diversified investment strategy."},{"prompt":"Why does it seem so many foreigners, particularly those of Asian decent, own nail salons?

Do you think it makes a big difference if you get Coke or Pepsi?","completion":"In the UK it is because there is a criminal offence called “Passing off”, a type of fraud. It means that a customer asks for one thing, and you “pass something off” as that item when it is not. At the top end of the range it could be a cheap fake instead of a Gucci handbag. In pubs, restaurants etc it is normally soft drinks that are the risky areas as people will always ask for their favourite brand, ie Coke or Pepsi. If the waitress gave you Pepsi when you asked for Coke and you worked for Trading Standards (the people who check these sort of things) you could be liable to a fine for it, unless the person is told it is Pepsi and asked if that is ok. If you went to KFC and asked for a chicken burger meal, would you want to be given a McDonalds chicken burger meal instead?"},{"prompt":"Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu Kurdish?","completion":"Yes he is , although he is an assimilated Kurd ."},{"prompt":"Why is the microwave oven harmful to food?","completion":"No, food cooked in a microwave oven is not necessarily bad for your health. Microwaving is a safe and efficient way to cook food, and the microwave radiation used in cooking does not make food radioactive or cause any long-term harm to human health. However, it is important to note that microwaving food can cause some changes in the food's nutritional value. For example, some nutrients such as vitamin C may break down when exposed to high temperatures, including those in a microwave. Additionally, microwaving food in plastic containers that are not microwave-safe can cause harmful chemicals to leach into the food. To ensure that food cooked in a microwave oven is safe and healthy, it is recommended to use microwave-safe containers, avoid heating food in plastic containers unless they are specifically designed for microwave use, and stir or rotate food while cooking to ensure even heating. Additionally, it is important to follow cooking instructions carefully and use a food thermometer to ensure that food is cooked to a safe temperature.

Price volatility, trade volume, technical indicators, and fundamental analysis are a few examples of such variables. Use a Stock Screener: Make use of a stock screener to filter stocks according to your selected criteria. The relative strength index (RSI), moving averages, or any other indicators relevant to your strategy. Set Filters for Swing Trading: When setting filters for swing trading, think about looking for equities with short-term price momentum and swing potential. Look for stocks that are approaching important support or resistance levels, have a history of price volatility, or all three. Set Filters for Positional Trading: When setting filters for positional trading, concentrate on identifying equities that have the potential for long-term trends and sustained price movement. Take into account criteria such as firms with solid fundamentals, increasing earnings, and technical indicators pointing to a longer-term bullish trend.

I have worked for a subsidiary of Lockeed Martin for years and maintained several very large C / C++ enterprise applications of theirs.

Are private schools better than public schools?","completion":"According to the statistics, yes. Private schools are better than public schools in every regard except cost. People believe this because private schools provide better education than public schools, but they also provide social gatherings, club activities, and other social events that the students never get at their school. Public schools would do well to take some lessons from the private schools. Private schools in Malaysia come with a certain level of prestige and a few benefits your child will appreciate, but don't expect the luxuries of a 5-star hotel. A huge part of going to a private school is going to class. Compulsory school uniforms, strict rules regarding hair color, and strict attendance policies are common in private schools. Wealthier families will often pay for after-school activities such as sports or music lessons. Many schools have special contracts with local physicians and hospitals, which provides the convenience of ready access to specialists without paying costly medical bills. Private schools also organize a significant number of cultural events throughout. A private school education in K.L. will cost you a minimum of RM3,500 per month, while a public school education costs way less. But how much better is a private school? The general consensus is that it's worth paying extra for smaller class sizes and teachers who can spend more time with their students. How much value does an education add to your child's future earning potential, plus the perks of networking and international exposure? Private schools have always been associated with having better facilities, better teachers and higher academic standards than public schools. This is true since private schools usually employ highly trained and experienced teachers and often provide access to better facilities and accommodations."},{"prompt":"What are some recommended laptops for college?","completion":"A cheap workhorse.

Cost only £250 and lasted for three years and then only because it's EOL and our security controls don't let me use it any more. It would still make a fine college laptop. Shit.

However on a person by person basis Bangladesh is not far behind:- Pakistan GDP PPP: 1,060,569. Bangladesh GDP: 686,598. Pakistan GDP PPP Per Capita: 5,354. Bangladesh GDP PPP Per Capita: 4,207. But if you talk about other factors, I’d say yes. Put it this way, I have been to Bangladesh. More than once. But you couldn’t pay me 15.6 million PKR to live/work in Pakistan.

The story of Najat Vallaud-Belkacem is a testament to this, who overcame all the obstacles life laid at her feet and carved her own destiny. Once a shepherd girl of four — who fetched water from the well — Najat moved to France with her family and faced the real world full of opportunities as well as struggles. The Moroccan girl who had no proficiency in French learnt the language by the end of her first year in college. Reported by The Guardian, while describing the cultural change in her life, Najat said: \\"The fact of leaving one’s country, one’s family, one’s root can be painful, my father had already found his place, but for us, for my mother, it was very difficult to get our bearings.\\" Najat inherited hard work and resourcefulness from her father who laid strict rules for his daughters - no boys and no nightclubs till the age of 18. As a result, the girls completely surrendered themselves to studies. Najat's sister, Fatiha, is a lawyer in Paris. While studying at the University of Amiens, Najat got the opportunity to pursue higher education with the prestigious Institut d’études politiques de (also known as Sciences Po). This set her on the path winding the political landscape in France. Najat worked two jobs to take the financial load off her parents while pursuing her Master's in Public Administration. It is during this time she met Boris Vallaud, a fellow student, and the two married in 2005. Najat's political career began with her joining the Socialist Party as an adviser to the mayor of Lyon. She later ran for elections and won the seat of the Councillor. In 2012, she was appointed as the Minister of Women’s Affairs by François Hollande, the then Socialist president. In 2014, she served as the Minister of Women’s Right, Minister of City Affairs, Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports. In a major cabinet shuffle, she was promoted to serve as the Minister of Education. While advising the youth who want to participate in the country's politics, Najat said, \\"I have always advised the youths to get involved in politics. The best way to be happy with your future is by playing a part in it. If you’re just a spectator of collective fate, you’re bound to feel frustrated.\\" Thanks for reading✨"},{"prompt":"As a Buddhist, how can I increase my level of compassion without being taken advantage of?","completion":"Have you ever held an infant who cried, threw up on you, or poked your face hard enough to cause you pain? Did you get mad and slap him or her in rage? Or did you understand that they were acting out of ignorance, and try to address their pain? I hope the latter. Yes, you may have held that infant a little farther away from your face to avoid getting poked again, that’s just intelligent. You might have even deliberately caused them some discomfort to help condition them in a healthy way. (I understand that some American Indians would gently twist their babies’ nose to teach them not to cry.) But you don’t consider that infant to be horrible because they don’t have the wisdom to understand what’s going on.

British style chocolate, allegedly better but not exported widely. British beer is so awful that it's not commonly exported except to where there's a large ex-pat community. Farmhouse scrumpy. Like cider except opaque. Blue/Green cheeses. Cheese with actual controlled mould in it. Our Chinese food is more chinglish than truly Chinese. Likewise our Indian food commonly has meat. Doner kebab. How is this not worldwide? What do you eat after a hard night drinking session? Chips. Totally different from fries. Preferably with plenty of salt and vinegar. If we have ketchup it goes on the side of the plate so we can dip our chips in it. We can replace ketchup with brown sauce in the UK.

It is hoped that this discipline will attract investors. International bodies also hoped that investment in India will increase , but our experience of last six years showed us that it rather decreased. In such situation many are demanding that the government should try to raise revenue by solving out the tax conflicts and giving them the charm of converting black money into white. But this step is just a band-aid in a situation that demands a surgery. Oil prices can go up due to America-Iran conflict. Our export will also get effected. Earth’s rising temperature has begun to show its effects in our country also in the form of disasters. In the absence of sufficient employment, people will protest more vigorously on Citizenship Ammendment Act or CAA. Reserve Bank is helpless. Tax deduction is neutral. One way to increase the demand is that government should raise its capital expenditure by giving up the ways to control economic losses. But we'll have to see that what would be the effect of these investments on a common man. Some investments are harmless. Improving the village roads is also an investment in basic infrastructure and it has positive effects on a common man. One more example is national waterways. Transport of coal and other things from Haldia to Varanasi via waterways can lead to savings but it will ruin the metier of small sailors and fishermen. Purchasing power of common man will drop. Instead, if we promote the transportation through small boats , it will still be an investment in basic infrastructure but will lead to positive effects on the purchasing power of a common man. Nowadays , markets are seeing drop in demands as we are investing in infrastructure like highways, waterways and cutting down of forests due to which the income of a common man is decreasing. If the government keeps aside the worries of economic losses and invests in those infrastructures that will raise the purchasing power of a common man , economy will revive. In the 2nd quarter of current financial year there was an overall 7•8% increase in private consumption , which was less than 14•4% which it was during the last year. Government consumption is at its normal pace but the private consumption is decreasing. When roads are constructed in a village, demand of cement-steel increases. On the other hand by increasing the salaries of government officials, demands of cars etc increase but this doesn't has a comprehensive benefit. In order to get over the present crisis , government should freeze the salary allowances of its workers so that the burden on government's expenses is reduced. Government should also think about the privatization of public banks' and other beneficial units. Furthermore, government should heavily invest in the creation and spread of new technology like online education so that our youth can get employment in these rising sectors. The basic idea is that the government should think about increasing the income of a common man."},{"prompt":"What are the pros/cons of using alcohol vs. marijuana?","completion":"[LINKED_TEXT: 7 Days to Drink Less] [URL: https://sites.google.com/view/sevendaystodrinkless/home] Anything in excess will always cause harm.

It is obviously sexist, but I cannot see racist undertones in it.","completion":"There’s nothing remotely racist or sexist in the poem. Anyone who finds the closing line to be sexist is trying wayyyy too hard to be offended. I’ll be the first to take up the fight against genuine sexism, but projecting all gendered concepts through all of history as sexism is both aggravating and counterproductive to gender equality. The objection, I suspect, is to Kipling himself. Kipling was a white Brit born in the mid-19th century to colonial parents in India. He was a product of the culture of casual imperialism so inherent to British society at the time, and he undoubtedly had racial and imperialist views that would seem outdated to us today. That said, I’m not familiar of any evidence that he was particularly racist by the standards of his time. In fact, he seems to have had a genuine affection for India and its people, and recognized some of the troubling aspects of European imperialism. Point is, even denouncing Kipling as a racist shows a total disregard for context or social realities. That kind of cheap offense can be used against pretty much any historical figure from whom we have significant writings: almost without exception, one of them will have said something that comes across as offensive to modern ears. But to go beyond that and say that a poem that never alludes to any issues of race is inherently racist because it was written by a 19th century European is utterly ridiculous. People who do so strike me as people who are less interesting in actually solving problems than they are in making clear how angry they are about whatever they’ve decided to be angry about this week."},{"prompt":"false surrendering a war crime?

Back then, education was unheard of, only selected few had any “education” at all, and these were the priests and religious leaders. How then, to explain Creation, but to SIMPLIFY it down, so that the average person and the masses could comprehend. Each “day” of Creation could have been a billion years or more in human terms, but how can the masses understand this, so boil it down to a “Day\\", to simplify it. God did not wave a magic wand and in 6 Days created the world with all it's physical laws, for life to exist. Therefore He conceived of Evolution as the science so that the earth and it's elements evolved and physical laws took shape to make life possible on earth. Imagine, for example, if there are no Physical Laws such as Laws of Gravity, Laws of Motion, etc, how can life exist on earth. Put up a structure or have physical motion and leave it to chance ?? Therefore, Darwin's Theory of Evolution, supports that a Creator, a Greater Being, conceived, and created the world so human life can exist.

Rudra, who till then signified a deity, became an epithet or an aspect of Shiva ; while Siva which term till then meant a benevolent or gracious virtue became the name of a great deity.

Not surprisingly, Rudra came to be closely associated with the god of death, Yama; with the god of fire, Agni; and with the magical drink, soma.

Rudra Rudra in Vedas 1.1. The earliest mentions of Rudra occur in the Rig Veda, where three entire hymns are devoted to him. It is said that there are as many as seventy-five references to Rudra in the Rig-Veda Samhita. Most of those occur in the First and the Second Books. [For details please see Notes below@] Rudra is a divinity of the mid-sphere 2.1. Rig Veda mentions a set of thirty-three deities. According to Yaska-charya, the thirty-three gods are divided equally in three different planes of existence namely the celestial plane ( dyuloka ) the intermediate region ( antariksha-loka ) and the terrestrial region ( bhur-loka ) each plane having eleven gods. There is however a slight variation among the different traditions in naming the thirty-three most eminent deities ( trayastrimsati koti ) . According to the Shatapatha Brahmana , these thirty-three deities include eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, twelve Adityas, Dyaus, and Prithvi. aṣṭau vasavaḥ | ekādaśa rudrā dvādaśā-adityā ime eva dyāvā-pṛthivī trayastriṃśyau trayastriṃśadvai devāḥ – Sp.Br.4.5.7.2 While, Yaska-charya mentions: eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, twelve Adityas and two Asvinis. In the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad the Rishi Yajnavalkya at one stage says “The eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, twelve Adityas, Indra and Prajapati are the thirty-three gods”. aṣṭau vasava ekādaśa rudrā dvādaś-ādityāḥ ta ekatriṃśad aindraś caiva prajāpatiś ca trayastriṃśāv iti || BrhUp_3,9.2 || 2.2. In Rig Veda, Rudra is one of the intermediate level gods ( antariksha devata ). He is a divinity of the subtle world, the sphere of space, the mid sphere between the spheres of earth and the Sun ( Rig Veda 5.3 ). Y aska also classifies Rudra along with Marutas as the deities of the mid-region ( Madhyama-sthana-devatah ) tata.āgacchati.madhyama.sthānā.devatā ḥ .rudra ṃ ś.ca.marutaś.ca / – Nir. 7,23https://sreenivasaraos.com/tag/rudra-prashna/] [URL: https://sreenivasaraos.com/tag/rudra-prashna/]"},{"prompt":"What exercise can lose face fat?","completion":"Face Fat: Here's everything you need to know if you want to reduce face fat. Fat accumulation can be extremely stubborn and time-consuming to burn. Be it arms, legs or face, excess fat can make one appear unfit and make one unhappy with their appearance. Face fat is one of the most common concerns people often have. Face fat is also considered one of the most stubborn fats to burn. There are various misconceptions and spread of misinformation around how can face fat be reduced. In this article, we list the actual ways through which you can reduce your face fat. Do facial exercises Facial exercises can be used to improve facial appearance, combat aging, and improve muscle strength Anecdotal reports claim that adding facial exercises to your routine can also tone facial muscles, making your face look slimmer. Some of the most popular exercises involve puffing out your cheeks and pushing the air from side to side, puckering your lips on alternating sides, and holding a smile while clenching your teeth for several seconds at a time. Although evidence is limited, one review reported that facial exercises may build muscle tone in your face Another study showed that performing facial muscle exercises twice per day for 8 weeks increased muscle thickness and improved facial rejuvenation Keep in mind that research is lacking on the effectiveness of facial exercises for fat loss specifically. More studies are needed to evaluate how these exercises may affect facial fat in humans. Add cardio to your routine Often, extra fat in your face is the result of excess body fat. Losing weight can contribute to fat loss and help slim down your body and face. Cardio, or aerobic exercise, is any type of physical activity that increases your heart rate. It’s widely considered a highly effective method for weight loss. Multiple studies have found that cardio can help promote fat burning and increase fat loss What’s more, one study found that women with obesity experienced greater fat loss when they engaged in more cardio exercise Try to get 150–300 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise each week, which translates to 20–40 minutes of cardio per day Some common examples of cardio exercise include running, dancing, walking, biking, and swimming. Drink more water Drinking water is crucial for your overall health and can be especially important if you’re looking to lose facial fat. Studies suggest that water can keep you feeling full and enhance weight loss. In fact, one small study found that drinking water before a meal significantly decreased the number of calories consumed during the meal Other research suggests that drinking water may temporarily increase your metabolism. Increasing the number of calories you burn over the course of the day can help boost weight loss Limit alcohol consumption Enjoying the occasional glass of wine with dinner is fine, but excessive alcohol intake can be one of the biggest contributors to fat accumulation and bloating. Alcohol contains mostly empty calories, meaning that it is high in calories but lacking in important nutrients, such as vitamins and minerals It also acts as a diuretic — a substance that increases the production of urine. This can lead to dehydration and water retention Some research also suggests that alcohol could influence levels of certain hormones that affect hunger and appetite. For example, it may reduce levels of leptin, a hormone that promotes feelings of fullness What’s more, studies show that heavy drinking could increase inflammation and may be associated with an increased risk of weight gain, increased belly fat, and obesity Keeping your alcohol consumption in check is the best way to avoid alcohol-induced bloating and weight gain. According to the current Dietary Guidelines for Americans, moderate drinking is defined as up to two drinks per day for men and up to one drink per day for women Cut back on refined carbs Foods containing refined carbs, such as cookies, crackers, and pasta, are common culprits of weight gain and increased fat storage. These carbs have been heavily processed, which strips them of their beneficial nutrients and fiber and leaves little behind besides sugar and calories. Because they contain very little fiber, your body digests them rapidly. This leads to spikes and crashes in blood sugar levels and may make you more likely to overeat One study in 277 women showed that a higher intake of refined carbs was associated with a higher risk of obesity and greater amount of belly fat No studies have looked directly at refined carbs’ effects on facial fat. However, replacing refined carbs with whole grains may help increase overall weight loss, which may also aid facial fat loss Get enough sleep Catching up on sleep is an important overall weight loss strategy. It may also help you lose facial fat. Sleep deprivation can cause an increase in levels of the stress hormone cortisol. High cortisol levels come with a long list of potential side effects, including weight gain Studies have shown that high cortisol levels can increase appetite and alter metabolism, resulting in increased fat storage Furthermore, squeezing in more sleep may help you shed extra pounds. One study found that better sleep quality was associated with successful maintenance of weight loss Conversely, studies show that sleep deprivation can lead to increased food intake, weight gain, and decreased metabolism Ideally, aim for at least 8 hours of sleep per night to aid weight management and facial fat loss. Watch your sodium intake The main source of sodium in most people’s diets is table salt. You might add it to food from a shaker, but you may also consume it passively as part of processed or premade foods, sauces, and other everyday condiments. One trademark symptom of excess sodium intake is bloating, which may contribute to facial puffiness and swelling. That’s because sodium causes your body to hold on to extra water — this is called fluid retention Several studies have shown that a higher intake of sodium can increase fluid retention, especially in people who are more sensitive to the effects of salt Processed foods account for more than 75% of sodium intake in the average diet, so cutting out convenience foods, savory snacks, and processed meats can be an effective way to reduce your sodium intake [LINKED_TEXT: I lost 57 lbs weight just 5 weeksI lost 57 lbs weight just 5 weeks \\"I've never seen the weight come off like this.

Eat more fiber One of the most popular recommendations for slimming your face and losing cheek fat is to increase your intake of fiber. Fiber is a substance in plant foods that your body doesn’t absorb after you consume it. Instead, it moves slowly through your digestive tract, keeping you feeling fuller for longer. In this way, it can help curb cravings and decrease appetite In one study in 345 people with overweight and obesity, higher fiber intake was associated with increased weight loss and helped people stick to a low calorie diet Another review of 62 studies suggested that eating more soluble fiber may reduce both body weight and waist circumference, even if you don’t restrict your calorie intake Soluble fiber is a type of fiber that forms a gel when mixed with water. One common type of soluble fiber in the diet is beta glucan, which is found in oatmeal, barley, and other cereals. Fiber is naturally found in a variety of foods, including fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains, and legumes. Ideally, you should aim to consume at least 25–38 grams of fiber per day from these food sources Improve overall diet Diets high in processed foods, including refined carbohydrates, may increaseTrusted Source the risk of weight gain and obesity. Processed foods tend to contain more calories, salt, and sugar than whole foods. Refined carbohydrates are a group of highly processed, grain-based foods. During processing, these foods lose fiber and nutrients. As a result, they are high in empty calories. Refined carbohydrates can also cause rapid spikes in blood sugar, which may encourage a person to overeat. Examples of refined carbohydrate foods include: pastawhite ricewhite breadsucrosesyrups and frostingsmost breakfast cerealsreduced-fat products In most cases, people can find reasonable replacements for overly processed foods and refined carbohydrates. A person can decrease their caloric intake and increase the amount of nutrients they consume by eating fresh whole foods. When combined with exercise, a healthy, balanced diet may help people lose excess fat in the face and body. Frequently asked questions Here are some common questions about reducing facial fat. How can I lose face fat in a week? Reducing alcohol consumption, getting plenty of sleep, staying hydrated, and limiting salt intake are a few simple ways to reduce swelling and fluid retention, which may make the face appear slimmer. What foods make the face fat? There are no specific foods that can increase facial fat. However, consuming more calories than a person uses each day can contribute to weight gain, which could lead to increased facial fat over time."},{"prompt":"f you were 80 and you had the option to become 30 again, would you do it?","completion":"i’m 75. if i could have internally my 30 year old fast sprinting body, i’d go for it. but, i earned the way i looked, earned it in the battles of society and love, and i am what i am."},{"prompt":"Can a shower caddie that hangs on the shower head damage the plumbing?","completion":"Only if you keep your anvil collection in the caddy."},{"prompt":"w can you nominate Anthony Fauci for the Nobel Prize in either peace or medicine?","completion":"Easy.

Look for reputable brands with a track record of ethical practices and prompt commission payments.

By following these principles and incorporating them into your approach, you'll be well on your way to unlocking the true potential of Affiliate Marketing.

This has resulted in a decrease in profits for many of the smaller, regional carriers who can't compete with the larger airline's resources. Additionally, some of these smaller carriers feel that Emirates is taking away their customers by offering lower fares and more amenities than what they can provide. Ultimately, this has caused tension between the two groups as each tries to gain an edge over one another in order to remain profitable."},{"prompt":"What coins were in use in Italy in the 6th century A.D. and what was their value?","completion":"I'm no expert on the Late Anitquity's numismatics but I know the Ostrogoths did mint their own coinage, and obviously Roman coinage would probably still be in wide circulation (especially in Byzantine controlled Exarchate of Ravenna), and certainly some Frankish coinage would be found closer to France.

Am I fired, or did I quit?","completion":"In the situation you described, it appears that you are being asked to resign from your position, which means you are technically quitting rather than being fired. Your manager expressed that they are unable to retain your position, and by asking for a resignation letter, they are requesting you to voluntarily step down from your role. In such cases, employers may ask for a resignation letter to document the employee's decision to leave the company voluntarily. This can have implications for things like final pay, benefits, and the terms of your departure. It's important to carefully consider your options before submitting a resignation letter. If you feel uncomfortable or uncertain about the situation, you may want to seek legal advice or speak with HR to understand your rights and the implications of resigning. Resigning voluntarily can have different implications than being terminated, so it's crucial to be informed and make a [LINKED_TEXT: decision that aligns with your best interests.] [URL: https://academiaxperts.in/]"},{"prompt":"Why is blue the most used color on the internet?","completion":"Because blue is most people's favorite color, by a wide margin.

Human toothpaste often contains ingredients that can be harmful to dogs, such as xylitol, which is toxic to them. Dog toothpaste usually has a more appealing flavor to dogs and is designed to be swallowed. Additionally, it's important to introduce tooth brushing to your dog gradually, as some dogs may not be comfortable with the process. Start with letting your dog sniff and lick the toothpaste before progressing to brushing their teeth. You can also use other dental products, such as dental chews or water additives, to help keep your dog's mouth healthy and fresh. However, if your dog has persistent bad breath, it could be a sign of dental problems or other health issues. It's recommended to take your dog to the vet for a checkup and professional dental cleaning if needed. Overall, while giving your dog toothpaste for bad breath can be safe and beneficial, proper care and attention to their dental health are crucial for their overall well-being.

Check with an attorney to determine what recourse, if any, against the title company. They’ve got insurance (errors and omissions insurance) to cover situations in which they screw up.

The founders were of the correct mind that the right to arms was to secure all rights.

It is the proponents of oppression, slavery and human suffering that demand citizens give up their right so such aberrants and rejects of society can do as they wish."},{"prompt":"What is jazz?","completion":"Music theory alone does not define jazz nor any other style of music. This is an extremely hard question to define, and every single answer you will get can be easily countered or challenged by another opinion. This is even more true if you're asking just musicians to respond to the question. The one small thing that everybody could probably agree on is that improvisation is perhaps the most important part of the tradition of the music. Without improv, it is not jazz. Typically, any music being read from sheet music will not be extremely detailed in terms of notation and by definition leaves much open to interpretation by the performers. That interpretation may be guided with a lot, a little, or sparse chord changes/forms/instructions. To give you some further scope on how much this question is avoided and debatable by many artists, I can tell you that I have applied for grants with Chamber Music America who provide composition grants for both classical and jazz composers. I remember at one of the information sessions a composer asked how CMA defined jazz for the purposes of the grants, so that the composer knew whether to apply for the classical or jazz application given the crossover nature of his work. CMA told the artist that it was up to them to figure out the definition of their music and which one it belonged in. They refused to try to put a definition on what jazz is or is not!"},{"prompt":"What are easy recipes to learn if I don't know how to cook or even prepare basic dishes?","completion":"I think understanding the purpose of cooking will help you learn how to cook.

It sounds counterintuitive, right? Well, let me explain. Research has shown that when people use larger forks while eating, they tend to consume less food compared to those using smaller forks. It's like a magic trick for portion control! The reason behind this phenomenon is quite fascinating. Our brains rely on visual cues to determine how much we've eaten. When we see a smaller portion on a large fork, it appears more significant, tricking our brains into thinking we've had enough food. As a result, we feel satisfied with less. On the other hand, if we use a small fork and take smaller bites, it may not register the same way in our minds. We might perceive the smaller portions as insufficient, leading us to eat more to feel satisfied. So, if you're looking to manage your food intake or practice portion control, using a bigger fork might just do the trick. It's a simple yet mind-blowing way to hack your brain and potentially eat less without feeling deprived.

Have you ever thought about how do bats hunt during night times…..?? Here the answer….. Bats..we all know that bats will be active at night times rather than daytime's for their pray. This is because most of the insects and other birds can't escape in dark and they can't see clearly their surroundings..Bats also unable see clearly during night times but here the concept of echolocation and Doppler effect comes… Bats produces sound waves with high pitch and frequency that beyond the human rangee.These waves as echos travel in the air and hit and finnaly hits the target and returns to the source(bat) this principle is called echolocation. the echolocation sound has an extremely high pitch so high that it is beyond the human hearing range. But the sound behaves the same way as the sound of your shout. It travels through the air as a wave, and the energy of this wave bounces off any object it comes across. A bat emits a sound wave and listens carefully to the echoes that return to it. Image: Google source… A bat can tell how big an insect is based on the intensity of the echo. The­ bat can sense in which direction the insect is moving based on the pitch of the echo. If the insect is moving away from the bat, the returning echo will have a lower pitch than the original sound, while the echo from an insect moving toward the bat will have a higher pitch. This difference is due to the Doppler effect. Thanks for reading… Koushik: )"},{"prompt":"Why does this generation have a lot of depressed people?","completion":"Hi!

One major reason not to would be that it might be booby trapped! We tend not to have pitched battles in modern warfare so it's not often you'd see a lot of enemy weapons on the ground. Mostly with hit and bugger off tactics the enemy takes their weapons with them when they have had enough of playing real soldiers as they might not have an abundance of firearms back at base. If you got to the point of needing the enemies weapons to carry on fighting something has gone very wrong and you'd have bigger issues to deal with than no weapon. Being able to use the enemies weapons also relies upon there being ammo for them as well.

How do you beat a slot machine with skill? You could weight your bets, but you would never come close to overcoming the preset odds. The only games of true skill are card games. But be forewarned, any skill beyond your organic brain is cheating in the eyes of the casino. If you experience consistent success, the casino takes notice of everything you do on 3,200 cameras in the casino. So you can count cards, with a friend, and a handy little computer strapped to your leg. It's been done, and caught. Card counters can make a modest income, for awhile, but remember, casinos have full time staff looking just for you. Eventually, you will get caught and blacklisted from every casino in Nevada and New Jersey with photographs and fingerprints to lock you out of casinos for life.Also, some casinos have card rooms. It's just a friendly game with random individuals who showed up in the card room, right? No, most of the card players you see in the card room are hired hands of the casino; their only job is to relieve you of your money and they are cooperating with one another to do it. Is there any way to win more than you lose at a casino? Yes. A very small percentage of people have done it and continue to do it for a living. It's sports betting. The house always has the advantage by 10% minimum on sports booking. But could you overcome that 10% with your tactical and strategic knowledge of a given sport? Yes, but you won't do it with mathematics. It's done with wisdom. Countless hotshots with Ph D' s galore have teamed up to build algorithms to beat the sports book, and they fail. The people who do win more than they lose do it through wisdom. It takes a special kind of brain to recognize when to wager and when to not. Over the long run, how do I win more than I lose? You never take a wager that is not in your favor. The sports book line is set based on the aggregate pool and the casino has to move the line to accommodate how much money is moving one way or another. The people who recognize a sports book line in their favor make a bet. If the line never moves to your favor, you just don't place a bet. There's no end to the number of MIT and Harvard hotshots who believe, surely with my superior mathematical knowledge, I can beat the house and the public. But they don't. For the very small number of gamblers who win more than they lose, which is less than 1% of the total, they do it through wisdom. Sure, good math is important, but math doesn't put you over the top. A few people have built algorithms to win more than they lose at horse racing. But in horse racing, you are not betting against the house. In horse racing, the house wins on every single bet, all of them. Because horse racing is pari-mutuel. The house gets a percentage of every single bet made. They don't care if you win every time, because they are winning everytime. In horse racing you are betting against the other betters, after the takeout percentage. There is a saying in horse racing: 98% of people consistently lose, 1% consistently break even, and one golden unbelievable percent turn a profit. To be in that 1% to turn a profit, it takes way more than mathematical and statistical knowledge. There was a very famous pair of guys who did it in Hong Kong in the 80's and 90's. But know this, every day guys go to work and punch a clock churning out the statistical data that horse players will use to evaluate their bets. If it were simply a matter of superior statistical ability, why are the guys who prepare the statistics still punching a clock? They could make a mint if they kept their statistics private, and hold an advantage over the public in numbers. Any successful algorithm must include wisdom to overcome the takeout rate. That's something the hotshot PhD's don't have. In common language it's horse knowledge. Las Vegas does not play games that do not make them a winner. All of their games are designed to relieve people of their money through greed, wanting to walk out with more than they walked in. If you somehow found a way to consistently beat the casino through skill at any of their games, you would stick out like nobody's business and they would be on to you very fast and shut you down for life. Of the people who turn a profit at sports betting, many are banned, but they make bets by proxy, hiring people to walk in and place bets in the casino on their behalf. That number is so small however, that the casino has no problem holding their preplanned statistical advantage in the game. If beating a casino consistently through mathematical skill was possible, there would be a continuous stream of Ph D bettors showing up a the casino to beat them. Simply put, it cannot be done according to the rules of math. In the rare circumstances where it can be done, sports betting, it's done through wisdom."},{"prompt":"What are the best GRE coaching centres in Delhi, especially for maths?","completion":"Look, if Math is not your forte then I would say you need formal coaching for GRE since quant can be really hard without a clear idea of your math concepts.

For most people here in Nepal, it's not about what we have in breakfast, it's about the company, discussions and gossips, giggles and laughs that we share during the breakfast. Here in Nepal, we value company over taste of food. Often times cheap food with right people seems heavenly and flavorful to us. Another breakfast choice that is particularly famous in Southern Nepal is thekuwa. It's basically fried cookies. I grew up eating these thekuwa for breakfast usually with tea. It's quite popular during Chath festival. It's sweet in taste and truly mouthwatering. At last, I wanted to say that breakfast culture is still not a norm in many households. We, Nepalese particularly middle class people are extremely impatient, so we often skip breakfast or usually have tea in the name of breakfast.

Research shows us that the number one variable, other than poverty, is the education level of the student’s mother. Homes with high incomes are likely to have mothers with one or more college degrees. The best education reform comes in the form of economic reform. High paying jobs and full employment will lift the performance of any school.

Injuries and general wear and tear on his left arm ended his career at the age of 30. 12 years just barely qualifies for HOF admission (10 year minimum). I’m guessing there was a lot of projecting going on in voters’ minds (“If he hadn’t gotten hurt, he’d have won at least 100 more games and had 1,000 more strikeouts”), but I know that, at the time, the perception of everyone, from the casual fan to the media to the players, was that Koufax was the greatest ever, based on those final 4 years.

Ambedkar hate Hinduism?","completion":"I think Babasaheb hated Hinduism because at that time and even now to some extent what Hindus practice in the name of Hinduism is actually Brahmanism, I have some knowledge as my fiance is a Sanskrit Master Degree Holder and I get to know some information from her, she said that in the Vedas there are no mention of birth based caste, rather it was Varnashrama in which people had to go through Chaturashrama's Brahmacharyashrama which is actually meant schooling in which anyone and everyone could join and when the study ends you get your Varna according to your skill and work, the Varnas were Brahman, Kshatriya, Vaishaya and Shudra, those who dealt with knowledge were given Brahman Varna, those who dealt with weapons were given Kshatriya Varna, those who dealt with economy were given Vaishya Varna anf those who failed to learn any skill were given Shudra Varna, Shudra meant labor, the first 3 Varnas were called Dwij means twice born and had to go through a Upanayan ceremony like Graduating Ceremony where they all were given Janeu to wear irrespective of the Gender, people were able to change their Varna within their life span for example, Ratnakar became Valmiki, prostitute's son Satyakam became Rishi Satyakam, then there are Apala, Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyi like women philosophers, then there was different ways of worship debated, Hindu denominations have different conceptions of God, including henotheism, monotheism, panentheism, pantheism, monism, and sometimes atheism or non-theism are found in a minority of Hindu denominations. so its will be injustice to say Hinduism which is more than religion, a civilization, a Jivan Dhara, a way of life is inherently inequal, actually I find it more equal, liberal that civilization at that time in case of sexuality, women empowerment, now ManuSmriti is relatively new and written 300+ people started nearly 2200 years ago and it brought in Birth Based Caste instead of Skill and Work based Varnashrama, spread more idol worship thus strengthened the hold of so called Brahmans in the society, destroyed our unity, paved way for Islamic invasion, birth based caste system started 1900 years, [LINKED_TEXT: When Did Indians Start Dividing Themselves Into Castes?] [URL: http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_world_/2013/08/20/origins_of_india_s_caste_system_genetic_research_suggests_the_country_s.html] and Aryan Invasion never happened [LINKED_TEXT: Aryan-Dravidian divide a myth: Study - Times of India] [URL: http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Aryan-Dravidian-divide-a-myth-Study/articleshow/5053274.cms] so nearly 2000 years ago we were living in a mostly equal society but we are not following those ideals today, Birth based Caste system is a worst anomaly in our great civilization and Babasaheb knew that as Hinduism so it is natural for him to hate Hindusim, now we are wise and must finish off the social evils like Babasaheb, Raja Rammohan, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar did!!"},{"prompt":"What are tips on building customer loyalty in a local business?","completion":"8 Ways to Create Real Customer Loyalty Set up ways to communicate with your customers.Provide extra perks for your most loyal customers.Consider different payment plans.Provide great customer service.Don't rely too much on technology.Offer a head start.Don't forget to smile.Give customers a reason to be loyal."},{"prompt":"Does Pink Floyd’s Dark side of the Moon album still have impact on today’s culture?","completion":"Depends on what you mean. Are people still discovering new things in it? Well, no, cause it’s already been so thoroughly explored. But is its impact still felt? Yes, and it always will be because it changed the trajectory of western popular music. First off, DSOM was the first record intentionally engineered for headphones. It doesn’t have to be experienced that way, of course, but it was designed with that experience in mind. When you listen to it with cans on, the music doesn’t seem to be coming at you from a stage in front of you, which is how engineers at the time thought of the listener space, but rather it seems to exist all around you, and even to run through your head at times. This was an extension of the Floyd stage show, which was famous for tricks like making it sound like water was flowing down the aisles and other such outlandish effects. DSOM changed how everybody thought about making records. The Beatles’ Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band is often cited for its use of sound effects, orchestra, seamless segues, and psychedelic lyrics and soundscapes (much of it inspired by the work of Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys) but not many people are aware that another band, Pink Floyd, were producing much weirder stuff at Abbey Road at the same time, and band members sometimes popped in on each other’s sessions. The groups were mutual fans, and John was first introduced to Yoko at a Floyd show at the UFO club. DSOM took all of that and pushed it harder than the Beatles or Brian Wilson had done while keeping the music mainstream. That album demonstrated that unapologetic psych/prog rock could not only be commercially viable, but could be a monster hit. We live in a post-DSOM world now. You can hear its influence in everything from rock to rap. There’s no way to wash it out of our clothes anymore. It will always be influential."},{"prompt":"Whats the #1 thing you always pray for?","completion":"One of the shrewdest and smartest maneuvers in business history is Apple's launch of the iPod and iTunes in 2001. At the time, the music industry was facing challenges from digital piracy and illegal file sharing. Apple's co-founder, Steve Jobs, recognized this as an opportunity and came up with a brilliant strategy to revolutionize the way music was consumed and purchased. Apple introduced the iPod, a sleek and user-friendly portable music player, and complemented it with iTunes, a digital music store where users could legally purchase and download songs for a nominal fee. The genius of this move was not just the innovative product itself, but also the way Apple approached the music industry. Jobs negotiated with major record labels to secure the rights to sell their music on iTunes, ensuring a wide selection of popular songs. He also convinced the labels to adopt a \\"single-track\\" pricing model, allowing customers to purchase individual songs instead of being forced to buy entire albums. This move addressed consumer demands for flexibility and affordability. By creating a seamless ecosystem of hardware, software, and content, Apple changed the music industry's landscape and established the dominance of legal digital music distribution. The iPod and iTunes became a massive success, revolutionizing how people consumed music and propelling Apple to become one of the most valuable companies in the world. This maneuver showcased the shrewdness and foresight of Apple's leadership team, who capitalized on the changing market dynamics to create a revolutionary product and business model that left a lasting impact on the music industry and beyond."},{"prompt":"ve the Democrats ever been as far to the left as they are in the 2019/2020 election cycle?","completion":"I don’t think so.

Whereas other non Big 4 firms are far less strict and regimented about how you get the work done as long as it gets done. In the Big 4 you have compliance training requirements throughout the entire year, have to disclose all of your investments, the dress code is more formal etc. Basically it is much more strict and corporate.

Take Rahul Dravid for example. He is hardly seen in the media and rarely in the news for any reason. He knows what he is capable of and so do his fans and cricket followers, but no one shows it off. It is the same case with most other locals. They are brilliant, but not many outsiders know about them because they are hardly interested in publicising or marketing their skills by themselves. How many know Sir M Vishweshwaraya? Except a few engineering students in Karnataka, most don't even know his name, even though his contributions are as huge as say CV Raman! Even most of the common people are very humble, welcoming and most importantly feel secure without feeling threatened by external factors. Sometimes it can backfire, but since they have greatest pride in their culture, they don't need to worry about losing their identity. Having been in Bangalore for more than 15 years, I have seen the changes all these years and even though there were some extremist groups that tried to play the role of the proverbial bad apples, they are just fringe groups and the society has remained peaceful and safe from the external bad influences.

North Korea has succeeded. There are no Chinese characters in their language. Their language is different than the Korean in South Korea. In South Korea the Chinese characters are referred to as Hanja. Jecond the Great in 1346 revised the Chinese they were using and devised an alphabet of 10 vowels and 14 consonants. Korean became an alphabetical language and was written in syllabic bundles with one consonant and one vowel in each bundle. The Vietnamese didn't become involved with the Chinese language. When Confuscious had his greatest influence in China the Vietnemese were pulling away so they have few Chinese influences in their language. The advantages of this shift are more independence from a bigger country who may be after your resources but less help from that same country if someone else is picking on you and you need his help."},{"prompt":"Can you use a CB magnet antenna without a whip?","completion":"No. The only purpose of the magnet is to hold the whip perpendicular to the roof of a car; the roff provides the ‘ground-plane” needed for the whip to work properly.

However, I think the USP of OnePlus of delivering a premium phone at a competitive price point makes it stand out among all other brands.

LOL LMAO When you walk past a worm on the street, do you stop and wonder what that worm is thinking about? Conversely, to the worm you are just a thing that passed by. The worm does NOT see you as being intelligent. There may be far more intelligent beings everywhere that just don’t care to be bothered with us and who we cannot even recognize as being intelligent because they are so far ahead of us.We have existed on this planet for a VERY long time and we cannot communicate with ANY of the lifeforms here yet. We can’t have a conversation with a monkey and monkeys are very close to humans genetically. Why do we assume we would be able to communicate with an alien life form?The very concept of ‘Intelligence’ is something WE invented to describe the difference between ourselves and the other lifeforms on the planet. It is specifically designed to flatter humans and may very well have no real substance whatsoever. Humans are ‘Intelligent’ because we characterize ourselves as being ‘Intelligent’. Without ever meeting a more ‘Intelligent’ being we simply cannot quantify our own ‘Intelligence’. We may very well be classified among the dumbest creatures in the universe.Snakes would be far more interesting to aliens than humans. Think about it, an alien visits the Earth and sees a snake, then he goes home ‘It sees in infrared, eats thing twice the size of it’s head and can move around with no arms or legs!’ Humans aren’t even the best designed creatures on Earth. You NEVER see an ant trip and fall like a klutz AND an ant can lift up to 800 times it’s own body weight without going ever to the gym. Or maybe there are ant gyms and we’re just too stupid to realize what they are.Part of our general justification for our ‘Intelligence’ is our ability to adapt and survive. There are organisms that have been on Earth for far longer than we can ever even begin to hope to survive. The Sun will die and kill us all and they will probably still be here for a while after we are gone. We did what was obviously needed to survive. These things were required by nature.Ancient Romans were every bit as ‘Intelligent’ as we are. They just had to follow the steps that lead to where we are today. People needed to invent the wheel, housing and things of that nature BEFORE they invented computers. An ‘Intelligent’ alien might not have a radio yet.Humans are pretty much the only creatures on the Earth ACTIVELY engaged in destroying their own habitat. I guess viruses do that as well but that’s NOT very ‘Intelligent’. Or, maybe it is. Maybe EVERY ‘Intelligent’ species destroys itself. Maybe that’s how the universe deals with ‘Intelligence’.We KNOW there are places we CAN’T go. There are galaxies that are BILLIONS of light years away. That means that, if you’re traveling at the speed of light, it will take you BILLIONS of years to get there. Even if we could travel that fast, we would STILL die before we got there.We lie to each other about science. There’s a huge you tube commercial campaign which talks about ‘uploading your consciousness to a mechanical body’ or some such nonsense. When you upload something, you don’t move it. You create a copy. The original file is still on your device. You would still die if somebody tried to ‘upload your consciousness’. And, yeah, there’s the old ‘we’ll figure it out’ excuse. But how? How would you know definitively that the consciousness you uploaded was the original? Maybe the process killed the original consciousness.

How do I find a place that could knit hats for me?","completion":"Hmm. You might be able to find someone to do this through your local yarn shop. Some yarn shops are involved in charity knitting for premature babies or cancer patients, and they often sell their customers’ work on spec. However, you should expect it to cost you quite a lot more, and/or to receive a much higher- or lower-quality finished item than elsewhere. Personally, I do not knit for sale. I design patterns for other people to knit. For a hat pattern in 3 sizes, I would expect to receive £200–400 for the written instructions and charts,sufficient free-to-me yarn to produce one sample for photography, the sample to be returned to me, andreturn to me of full publishing rights within 4 months to 2 years, and I’m cheap. You should see what the Big Designers get. I do sometimes sell samples, but usually I keep them for talks and workshops. You might tempt me to sell a sample hat for £50–150, depending on size, complexity, and yarn quality. Or, you could learn to knit for yourself. It’s not hard.

Pfizer originally intended the medicine to help people with high blood pressure but it caused one side effect on people suffering from erectile dysfunction by causing stronger and lasting erections. Erectile dysfunction had been a known issue then but there wasn’t a cure developed for it. So, Pfizer realized that they had solved a major problem prevalent not just in North America but all over the world. So to market this product, they went to several media houses who weren’t very willing to be open about this issue on their covers and front pages considering the taboo that surrounded erectile dysfunction due to the country still being conservative at that time. So Pfizer decided to have a press conference where the presenter started to strip down naked and then proceeded to swallow one of the Viagra pills to publicly demonstrate the effect of the medicine by showing their erection to the people present there. Naturally, this became a huge headline and almost every media house and newspaper covered this story and criticized Pfizer and Viagra on how this is not the right way to go about things but this helped people notice and know that Viagra as a solution exists considering the sizeable number of people suffering from this illness and that they could easily acquire it from their nearby chemists, this was one of the reasons why Pfizer grew really fast in the subsequent years.

Australia is also known for its multicultural society, and immigrants have played a significant role in shaping the country's cultural diversity. The Australian government has implemented various initiatives to support the settlement and integration of immigrants, including providing resources for language learning, employment support, and community programs. It's important to note that individual experiences as an immigrant can vary greatly depending on personal circumstances, cultural background, and other factors. While many immigrants have positive experiences and find Australia to be welcoming, others may face challenges during the settlement process. It's always recommended to research and understand the specific immigration programs, policies, and support services available before considering immigration to any country, including Australia."},{"prompt":"What are the six types of crystal shapes?","completion":"There are 47 different crystal forms (form is the name given to a collection of identical faces related by symmetry operations) generated by the 32 possible combinations of symmetry operations (rotation, reflection, inversion and rotoinversion) that define the crystal classes (or point groups). These 32 crystal classes are grouped in the 6 main systems named in one of the other answers. The first row, in the table below, is the cross section of the pyramid, dipyramid or prism shown in the rows that follow. This is why the numbering starts with the shapes of the 2nd row. (This table appears in International Tables for Crystallography (2016). Vol. A, Section 3.2.1, pp. 720–737, where credit is given to Shubnikov & Koptsik, 1974, p. 74.) Each form has a name. The class notes posted by professor Nelson from Tulane University give the individual names (though not in the order of their numbering above) at [LINKED_TEXT: https://www.tulane.edu/~sanelson/eens211/forms_zones_habit.htm] [URL: https://www.tulane.edu/~sanelson/eens211/forms_zones_habit.htm]When a crystal is well developed, it may display more than one type of form, or several variations of the same form (e.g. dipyramids that are more or less acute, and a prism). Therefore, a single form name may not describe entirely a given crystal shape. Mineralogists and crystallographers use a system of numerical indices (Miller indices) to refer to the faces because it is a comact notation that describes the relative position of the “planes” (faces) relative to a set of axes consistent with the symmetry of each crystal system. So the 47 kinds of forms, even though some cannot be found combined on the same crystal, give you a LOT of possible crystal shapes…"},{"prompt":"f Kurds are liberal, why don't they keep dogs like Turks?","completion":"Is this an AI generated question? A) Kurds are human and they are plenty, 15 million many in Turkiye. Are there any population who are 15 million strong and none of them liberal? Ofcourse many of Kurds of Turkiye are liberal, where are these nonesense gossips coming from? B) Who told Turks keep dogs? What does keeping a dog means? Owning a dog as a pet or like putting dogs in chain to guard a village villa? All kinds of keeping a dog works? If you are talking about having a dog as a pet in homes, only city dwelling modern people do that in Turkiye. That is equal among Turks and Kurds as both ethnicities are populating cities mostly. C) What is the relationship between being liberal and having dogs? Since when having a pet was a symptom of liberalism? I never read that anywhere. Seriously, are people who dislike dogs count as nonliberal? Pet owning sociologically is about having small families or not even having any. Thus is the modern western capitalist post industrialized sense, people lost their villages where they lived as big/grand families for education and jobs in cities. And birthrates fall in this competitive system. Yet human seek friendship and family. So more people own cats and dogs in modern cities than rural, oldschool villages and town.

Both sound the same to me as they both provide the environment to run a specific software.","completion":"Emulators emulate conditions (usually hardware) To run software in. They take a piece of software which could not run on the current system and create a sandbox for it to run in. Docker containers take your current core OS (Linux for example) and build abstraction layers on top of it to run an application in a notionally different, but reproducible , system. It can not emulate different hardware or infrastructure than your system. It simply allows you to say, “given my current known starting point give me a sandbox with the following things installed, then run my app”. The tools solve different problems. Emulators are solving the “I can’t possibly run this application, no matter what prerequisite I install, on my current system” problem. Docker solves the “I either want a reproducible way to run my application given my current system or don’t want the prerequisites installed on my host machine” problem. If anything confusing VMs and Docker containers make more sense, as at least they solve similar problems with slightly different benefits. For a solid example: I would use an emulator to run a Nintendo game on a win32 machine or a windows application on Linux or Mac. These systems simply CANT natively run the applications without an emulator. I would run a Linux microservice in a Linux Docker container, if I wanted to be able to bundle the prereqs as a part of the build, make t reproducible for other people, or simply didn’t want to bother with installing a complicated prerequisite (like odbc drivers) onto my host machine. In this case I totally could run the app locally but don’t to solve a different pain point.

I’ve focused on the New Zealand part of the book, but it gives a taste of just how dodgy the whole publication is. Zheng He is not a name that is well known in the west. However, his seven voyages from China, through the Indian Ocean to Africa between 1405 and 1435 would place him among the world’s great explorers. Yet retired submarine captain Gavin Menzies is convinced Zheng He’s feats were even greater. He believes a massive Chinese fleet conducted four simultaneous circumnavigations of the world between 1421 and 1423, during which they discovered the Americas, Australia, New Zealand, even Antarctica. But while they were away, the Chinese emperor turned his back on the outside world and, when the ships returned, had all mention of them erased. Why the records of Zheng He’s other expeditions were kept, Menzies does not explain. As Menzies tells it, he was set on his own personal voyage after viewing some early European maps. He claims these have details that could not have been known to Europeans at the time, and concludes only the Chinese could have mounted expeditions to map these areas. The Europeans then copied the Chinese charts. One is the Piri Reis map, which Erich von Däniken made so much of, with different conclusions. Another, the Jean Rotz map, shows land stretching to the south and east of Australia. Menzies argues this was solid ice stretching from Tasmania to the Auckland and Campbell Islands. What appear on the map to be rivers, Menzies interprets as harbours on these islands, which were, he claims, “at the normal limit of the pack ice that links them in midwinter.” Of course, they’re actually ice-free year round. After mapping this region, Menzies says the Chinese sailed north to New Zealand, pausing in Fjordland (sic) to drop off some giant ground sloths (which have been extinct for 10,000 years), collected in South America. A teak ship was then wrecked on Ruapuke Beach, south of Raglan, “near the mouth of the Torei Palma River” [I later figured out that this “river” must be the outlet drain from the Toreparu Wetland - at normal flows you can easily jump across it.] Further evidence cited includes a brass bell found in the area which bears a Tamil inscription (a Tamil ship must have joined the fleet for trading purposes, he says), some rocks with Tamil inscriptions on them, and a carved stone duck which resembles a Chinese votive offering. European cartographers then somehow got hold of the charts drawn by the expedition before the Chinese authorities destroyed them, and copied down the ice sheet to the south of Australia, but left out New Zealand, and, for that matter, most of China itself. It doesn’t take much research (using the same sources that Menzies consulted) to establish that the Ruapuke wreck (which originally came to light in the 1870s) was actually made from totara, the bell was found in the central North Island, the rock inscriptions are Maori, and the duck’s provenance is dubious, but unlikely to be Chinese. The whole book is like this. There is no logic whatever as he leaps from one piece of “incontrovertible” evidence to the next. The only mystery is how a reputable publisher could lavish such attention (the book is beautifully produced) on the kind of writing that is usually found in cheap pulp paperbacks. There’s talk of a TV series too."},{"prompt":"w do I get my son to stop making music?","completion":"It is important to remember that your son may have a passion for music and it is important to respect that.

Then a Target opened in my city (which, btw, is emphatically not close to the US border so I had no experience with American Target). The stuff was just trash. It was obviously really poor quality, and there wasn’t a ton of selection; and while the prices were not super expensive, they were still more than what I thought the stuff was worth. And given that you could very easily go to say, Walmart, and get a similar (or better) quality item for a better price, why go to Target? It was honestly slightly insulting. Given the big fanfare over Target, to see them sell such junk there, it was like they thought they could stock their stores with whatever and we’d just swallow it down cos we’d be so happy to have the chance to finally shop there. I know a few people who felt that way, anyway. The weird thing is, being in Australia now, Target’s stuff here is way better than it was in Canada. I have bought a few things there, whereas despite a few trips to Canadian Target, I never bought a thing there - never even tried anything on, and not even when they had their closing sales."},{"prompt":"What does a psychotic episode look like?","completion":"A person is confused and their behaviour is erratic and irrational."},{"prompt":"there a right way which finger to use when reading sheet music?

Firstly, the body can adapt to a certain eating pattern over time. When someone consistently eats only once or twice a day, their body can adjust and become accustomed to this routine. This means that the person may not experience hunger pangs or cravings during the times when they are not eating. Secondly, the type of food that someone eats can affect their hunger levels. Foods that are high in fiber, protein, and healthy fats can help to keep a person feeling full for longer periods. This means that someone who eats a meal that is rich in these nutrients may not feel hungry for several hours afterward. Thirdly, hydration can play a role in managing hunger. Sometimes, what feels like hunger pangs can be a sign of dehydration. Drinking water or other fluids can help to keep the body hydrated and reduce feelings of hunger. Lastly, some people may simply have a lower appetite or slower metabolism, which means they can go for longer periods without feeling hungry. It's important to note that while some people may choose to eat only once or twice a day, this eating pattern may not be suitable for everyone.

It is an assembly-line process, where different parts of the wood furniture-making process occurred at various steps. Ultimately, the benefits of this process were that good furniture, which had previously only been a luxury item, was now available to the majority of households. While there were certainly some benefits to the industrialization of furniture-making, its downsides were a level of skill and craftsmanship that was seemingly lost. When a furniture designer produces your furniture piece with his own hands, there is an undeniable level of care.

This image is one in a series, you can see the atoms in strands, though this is only a fraction of what the human eye is capable of or can detect and resolve. This is atomic ionization due to electrolysis which is causing the iridescent glow. I have outlined how to accomplish seeing atoms by naked eye, which is by the same process as was used to obtain this and other images. Regardless of possible or impossible, these are really atoms, it is really possible. Thank you. This one is taken in less than a second from the last, the atoms undergoing energy absorptions, spectrally glowing as they become electromagnetically charged and altered. This is still only a fraction of what the human eye can witness, estimated at a thousandth of the magnification for the eye, this is still approximately the range of 20,000x magnification. I found a way, it's possible to do more than we believe, within realms of rationality. This is the point of atrophy revealed. The atoms are losing electrons, gaining electrons, ions are formed, and the cycle will repeat. These are atomic strands, and I know for a fact that no similar process to view atoms exists, as it is considered impossible to capture images such as these, and that these are unique because it is an ACTUAL visual representation image captured from REAL atoms."},{"prompt":"What’s the point of the British guards (red suits and black hats)? Are they actually trained to take down threats? What weapons do they have?","completion":"Okay, ignore most of the bullshit answers blowing smoke up the Guards’ arses and making out like if you come at the Queen you’re gonna be getting double tapped in the face by Guardsmen. The Guards division is a historic one, they’re the oldest regiments in the British Army and date back to when it first became professional in the 16th-17th centuries, mostly. During that time they were the ones who performed the guarding of the royal household. They, for centuries, have also fought the country’s wars, from the civil war to the Napoleon Wars, the World Wars, Falklands and recently deployed on multiple occasions to Afghanistan and Iraq. However, they’re no more trained as an infantry soldiers than any other infantry unit than any other line regiment in the British Army, The role they play at the palaces is merely ceremonial one that’s born of tradition, something the British military is steeped in. They are not there to actually guard anything, Armed Police and security officers are there to do that. Trust me, nobody standing with parade like stillness has any sense of what’s going on in their peripheries. If they were actually guarding something they wouldn’t be so rigid. It’s a ceremonial position like the US Marines at the White House who are real soldiers, but it’s the Secret Service who do the protection,"},{"prompt":"w do ballroom dance competitions work?","completion":"I agree, we men are quite lazy.

Indeed, both Denmark and Canada have flirted with banning it because of certain food additives used in its production. It was once used as the ‘mystery ingredient’ that had to be included on an American cookery programme. None of the contestants had any idea of how strong the flavour is and were dolloping it into their creations by the ladleful (ok, slight exaggeration…). The results were all totally inedible. The trick to enjoying it is to use it very sparingly in order to appreciate its savoury qualities. I usually mix a teaspoon with half a pound of butter and keep it in the fridge to spread on my toast. Any stronger and I can feel the surface of my tongue being stripped back to a Teflon-like smoothness. The flavoured butter is also great for frying bacon, mushrooms and steak. I don’t use it every day so a small jar will last me a very long time. The commemorative jar I bought to mark the Queens Diamond Jubilee in 2012 is still going strong. 😊"},{"prompt":"Does Canada feel animosity towards the Trump administration for the threats and tariffs of the last two years?","completion":"I know many Canadians from all walks of life, from teachers to bankers, and we discuss various things all the time.

Along with this, the role also focuses on client needs and expectations from a business in the digital era, i.e., on the online platform. The main role of a BA is to understand the requirements of the stakeholders from the organisation and to analyse and implement these changes by forming strategies by means of data collection and analysis of the current market situation. The same applies to a digital business analyst but a digital business analyst is more centric towards the online market analysis and data orientation than the traditional BA. In short, a digital business analyst pitches the organisation about the digital transformation while keeping both the business and customer satisfaction in mind. Why did the role of business analysts shift digital? The reasons are pretty simple. Even though businesses expect pretty much the same outputs from a BA, they have a more centric approach to the functioning of these professionals. With the transformations happening so rapidly in technology, businesses have adapted to this atmosphere and shifted online too. Businesses want their digital dominance to compete and stand out from others. Therefore, the role of business analysts has shifted from offline to online. The two most important factors which contributed towards the drastic shift could be: • Technological Advancements: With technology growing and advancing every day, businesses have changed their platforms from offline to online. A need for establishing an online presence has become a necessity. Thus, businesses are now demanding business analysts who have knowledge about technical analysis along with non-technical skills.• Customer Predominance: As the world is growing online, so is the market. A lot of people who own business in similar fields now have an option to expose their business online. Due to this, the need for changing towards online markets and targeting their desired audience has become a need for the hour for most of the business. With so many options available and with an increase in competition, the customer has become the king. The need to understand the customer behaviour on the online platform is the most important goal for any business. By understanding their needs and the current market trends on the digital platform, organisations are trying to keep up with the changing times. What are the skills required for a Digital Business Analyst? The interpersonal skills which a digital business analyst requires are more or less the same as any other business analysts. To name a few we could list- • Interpersonal skills• Problem-solving skills• Analytical and decision-making skills• Strong Presentation skills All these skills are shifted online. To be more precise, the skills are used for the promotions, presence and profit making of the business on a digital platform. The other technical skills include- • Web development• Social media strategy planning• Programming languages• Data analysis and Design thinking• Statistical analysis and critical thinking• In-depth Domain knowledge• Customer behaviour• SEM• PPC• SEO• Advance Excel• Tableau• SQL By possessing the knowledge about these technical and non-technical skills, a digital business analyst improves his chance of getting hired than others. Why is Digital [LINKED_TEXT: Business Analytics ] [URL: https://businesstoys.in/programs/business-analyst-certification-program/]a preferred career option? The industry is now looking for professionals who have great digital knowledge of business analytics over traditional business analysts. As we mentioned about the changing business trends, an organisation prefers a digital business analyst to meet the right organisational goals along with profits. Thus, a digital business analyst plays an important role in the changing and fast-moving technical world: By implementing the current need of the market, the digital business analyst would be the perfect choice for the candidates who wish to pursue a career in the same field. What should the ideal learning pattern for a business analyst look like? • The right digital business analytic guidance is the one that offers a learning pattern including technical and non-technical skills.• It should cover all the key highlights that are important for a business analyst starting with the basics of business analytics and climbing up the staircase to advanced topics. These include the use of tools like SQL and Tableau and programming languages as well.• Working on live projects is a part of the curriculum. So, look for the course that offers you workshops about real-time projects in the field of digital business analytics.• The most important thing to look at before enrolling for a course in business analytics is to check if the certification offered by them is recognised and accepted in the industry.• Along with this, it is important to check if the certificate offered by the institute is valid.• The next important thing to make sure about is the placements offered. Do not fall for fake assurances and make a thorough check-up about the background of the institute you wish to enrol yourself in.

If there were a legitimate and/ or logical arguement in favor of gun control, it would have been presented long ago. For lack of a viable case, the anti- gun community only has emotion and ad hominem attacks. Now to convince you that gun regulation isn't a good thing. Historically, when governments have restricted or removed guns from their people it goes badly for the people as criminals already don't care about laws so they will remain armed. King George attempted to take the people's guns which is part of the reason the people wanted the right to bare arms be protected. (i.e. the 2nd Amendment). Every major city in America has high gun violence numbers and the more gun control legislation/ laws put in place, the higher the gun violence per capita. This isn't a mystery, just facts that people like to ignore.

How big is a big cat? Adult snow leopards are the smallest species of Big Cats, with adult snow leopards usually weigh 22 to 55 kg (49 to 121 lb), with an exceptional specimen reaching 75 kg (165 lb). When it comes to size the Dire Wolf was larger than the Gray Wolf (and about twice the size of the snow leopard), averaging about 1.5 meters (5 feet) in length and weighing between 50 kilograms (110 lbs) and more than 79 kilograms (174 lbs). So in terms of size the Dire Wolf was a Big Dog. The Gray Wolf is still around and they get to about 80 kg. Still much larger than the smallest Big Cat. So in terms of size as defined by the size range of Big Cats there are Big Dogs. But what makes a Big Cat a Big Cat is their ability to roar. Dogs as far as we know have never roared so they can’t be called Big Dogs if that is part of the definition. So either size defines a Big Cat, in which case there are Big Dogs, or the ability to roar defines a Big Cat, and there can’t be a Big Dog because they can’t roar. If that is the case there are no Big Dogs because of their larynx being wrong for producing a roaring sound."},{"prompt":"f you and your wife were laying in bed and you both hear a noise downstairs at 3 AM, do you believe that it is your duty as a man to investigate the noise and put yourself at potential risk to protect you and your wife?

It sounds so good to hear my man from her mouth. It feels, so better thinking she is by his side now. How fool I was to act so childishly? He thought while looking at her. She looks so radiant. The dark circle under her eye made him feel guilty, guilty of making her go through all that mess. And he promised himself that he will never hurt her again. Aakash, Aakash a voice screamed. That was Sonal screaming on top of her voice. Did you just hear what she said? How can she do that to us? Why aren’t you saying anything? He looked at Sonal, a beautiful girl in her late twenties. With those beautiful black eyes and slender face, that can make any guy fall for her. She was a beauty, flawless skin, straight nose, long curly jet black hair. She turned red in anger. How can you do that to us? He is mine, said Sonal, and I am going to fight till the end for my love. Aakash why aren’t you saying anything? Please tell her how much we love each other? Tell her that you can’t live without me. Sorry Sonal, his first words, since last one hour. I was wrong. I was wrong to think that I am in love with you. I can’t be. I can’t be in love with you. What the hell are you saying? Rohan, Sonal’s brother. 6 feet tall, well build Rohan was holding his anger till now, but couldn’t hold his anger now, said furiously. What the hell are you saying? After going around with my sister since last six months. Now realized that you don’t love her anymore? You are playing with her life. I will not leave you. Sonal was shocked to hear these words from Aakash. What is the problem darling? Is your wife threatening you? Tell me? Don’t you worry about her? We will take care of her. No Sonal, you heard me clearly I am not going to divorce her – Aakash And no, it is my decision to stay in this marriage. I know I have made a mistake. Mistake? You call it a mistake? You call my love a mistake? Those beautiful moments we spent together? Those cosy nights that we spent in each other arms you call it a mistake? For the first time during the last few hours, she felt uncomfortable thinking about those nights. But then she took hold of herself and pushed away all those thoughts. No, not now she said to her thoughts. Three nights, to be precise, she said calmly. He couldn’t dare to look at her. How can he? Sonal said, No, I am not going to leave you like this. I will teach you a lesson, a lesson that you will never forget in your entire life. I am going to go to police and the media. I am going to register a case. I am going to tell the world how you used me. I am going to lodge a complaint that you raped me under a false promise to marry me and now you are not honoring you promise. You are free to do what pleases you. But let me tell you before you register an FIR. I have already registered a case against you, she said. What? Sonal, Case against me? On what ground? You were trying to steal my husband. You lure him in your love and were blackmailing him – She What the hell? Sonal Yes. You lured him. You knew very well he is married and has two kids. Still, you got close to him. Didn’t you know he was married? When you guys first met in the gym? Didn’t you know he has two kids while you slept with him? In spite of knowing all this if you still choose to sleep with him, what does it mean? By this time Rohan and Sonal realized, she is a tough nut. It is not going to be that easy. Yes. I was aware. But I never decided to fall in love. It just happened – Sonal. No. It was pre-planned. You changed your gym timing every time to match his timings. You changed your office shift time to match his. You deliberately used to miss your pick up van so that you can take a lift from him. You must be a fool to think I didn’t notice all this, she said. Aakash thought for a moment were she really aware of all this or this is just her homework? He knew very well what his wife is capable of? If it comes to investigating something she can bet the CBI. She has an eye for detail. If she decides anything she will move a mountain from here to there. She was really a tough lady. Your bank transaction can very well prove that you were blackmailing him, Oh ho one more thing, I happen to meet Mrs. Gupta last week. Mrs. Gupta sister of your previous landlord Mr. Arora. Mr. Arora has expressed his interest to be my witness if need be. By now both brother and sister realized now the time has come to wrap up. Otherwise, the situation will be out of control. Don’t you get my sister’s character in between? We also have many things to talk about Mr. Arora. But I don’t want to go down to that level. He added if you want all this to end and don’t want any embarrassment, then pay us 5 Lakh and will not go to the media. 5 Lakh for what? For sleeping with my husband? She said. Mind your language? Said Sonal, I am not a prostitute. I don’t sleep with people for money. Oh ho but your brother just suggested that we should pay your 5 lakh. And we take money in exchange for either service… Sonal interrupted, We are asking for compensation, compensation for the mental and physical harassment that I went through since last six months. But a few minutes back you were talking about Love, and beautiful moments, cozy nights and now you are saying all that was harassment,she said. Rohan, see Mam (trying to be as polite as possible), there is no point in stretching the matter, let us close it matter on 2.5 Lakh No, she said. There was silence for a few minutes. I will pay you 1 Lakh, not a rupee more or rupee less. This is all I can do and any more word from you this amount will reduce to 0 (zero). Both sister and brother said at the same time We agree. I will have it deposited in your account by tomorrow evening. And if you try to act any smart you know whom are you dealing with –She They both looked at each other and acknowledge that never in future then will come ever closer to Aakash. She is a tough lady Rohan said to Sonal while entering in the lift. Aakash closing the door behind. By this time she went into the kitchen to prepare dinner. It was a long day. Why are we paying 1 lakh to them he asked She offered you her services for six months. I mean she entertained you for six months, she needs to be paid well. Don’t you think so? she said He looked away. I am sorry, he said. He meant. I will never.. She interrupted if you don’t mind, can you get rice from the general store. We are running out of rice. He realized she wanted to be left alone. He went to get the rice. Leaning against the dining table, she couldn’t control her tears. The thought of he choosing younger women over her was killing her from inside. Maybe it was her ego. Why are you doing this? If it is hurting you so badly? Why? Why? She sister over the phone last week. Because I want to see him alive, she said. What do you mean? Her sister He tried to commit suicide. Twice, she said. What? Her sister Yes, and a second time it was very close to death. Had it been delayed for a few minutes he would have been dead. When he gained consciousness, all that he said was “Save me only if you are coming back to me”. Babu, I can’t live without you. I know I have made a mistake. But only god knows it was not Sonal it was you, for me. Even then, even now. The face was that of Sonal but it was you that I was falling for. I was looking for you in her. I made a mistake to look for you outside of you. Please don’t go. If you leave me, I will leave this world. Please take me back. Hmm.. Her sister, that was a brave decision, but you must remember once a woman has forgiven her man, she must not reheat his sins for breakfast. She repeated her sister’s last line to herself. And then the doorbell rang. It was him. She opened the door. Looking deep into his eyes, she smiled from the bottom of her heart. And he knew he got her back. She hugged him tightly."},{"prompt":"w do you calculate","completion":"To quickly calculate the sum of consecutive numbers like 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10, you can use a formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

Now, in fairness, I’m sure lotteries get such crank calls all the time. “I figured out a way to beat your lottery. Pay me now or I’ll reveal it to the world!” Undeterred by the lottery official’s blow off, Srivastava did his civic duty and persisted. He bought a stack of tickets he knew would be winners. And he bought a stack that lacked the pattern. He sent both stacks (unscratched) via mail to the lottery head office. He wrote on a note “Stack A is 95% winners. Stack B is losers. Test it yourself. Want to know how I did it? Call me.” They did.

Though I am not a dedicated blogger, I have published a few articles and believe I can contribute my expertise. Since 2018, Target Internet has visited 10 of the world's highest-earning blogs once a year. Using a list based on Forbes' list of the world's highest-earning bloggers, we evaluated some of the factors driving each big blogger's success. Consider Digital Vidya's Certified Digital Marketing Master's Course if you want to learn how to start your own blog. Blogging has recently evolved into many other forms, ranging from conventional, proprietary blogs (such as the one you're reading) to blogging on third-party platforms like Quora, Medium and LinkedIn Pulse, and micro-blogging in social media captions. The blogging sector has been further divided into bloggers and social media influencers. Many people who would have become bloggers are now pursuing jobs as influencers. These shifts have given independent online content creators additional commercial and artistic options. The disadvantage is that blogging has grown more difficult to identify, and hence more difficult to report on as an industry. This influence has been so strong that the term \\"blogging\\" appears to be losing favor. According to Google Trends, global search traffic for 'blogging' and associated terms reached its lowest point on record in June 2019, and has been nearly flat since. As a result of these shifts, it is no longer simple to obtain reliable figures on bloggers' salaries from respectable sources, as publications such as Forbes have refocused on trendy topics such as Instagrammers and YouTubers. This may have been the clue to quit analyzing the performance of top compensated bloggers. Let's take a close look at each prominent blog's position in 2020. The earnings statistics shown for each blogger are the best-available estimates of Owler's yearly profits in US dollars.

I learned a lot about how ship are constructed and about damage control. I believe that it would be very difficult to sink a US Navy ship these days. Given the isolation of munitions and flammable, coupled with the watertight integrity, I don’t give them much chance. It is not like in WWII when a well-placed bomb or torpedo could cause uncontrolled flooding. In fact, I could see many of our ships being cut into several pieces and each piece floating. These days, the best goal would be to render the ship incapable of completing its mission. There are many ways to accomplish this, but that is beyond the scope of the question…"},{"prompt":"What are the best telegram groups for civil service preparation?","completion":"You can join our telegram group for civil service perparation.

Any such website would be illegal and unethical, as it would involve accessing someone else's account without their permission. Additionally, using someone else's account information is a violation of the terms of service of most websites and could result in your account being banned or suspended.

People stay in an unhealthy or abusive relationship just because of their family and society. Our family cares about society and we care about our family's emotions.

I don’t agree with that view, but I don’t consider it hypocritical. An example of a hypocritical view, IMO, would be being “pro-life” when it comes to fetuses but also pro-death penalty, for example."},{"prompt":"What was the strangest fast food order you've seen?","completion":"The weirdest order I have ever heard at a fast food restaurant was a request for a “burger with no bun, no cheese, no lettuce, no tomato, and a side of mashed potatoes and gravy”."},{"prompt":"You are having a big argument with your spouse.

He studied contemporary dance for years and due to BTS’s style of dance he usually doesn’t get to showcase it too much so when he gets to do his solos he really gets to show who he is individually as an artist. That’s why I love solo sets, even though BTS is a seven member group… in a sense they are seven individual artists with unique voices and artistic ways of expressing themselves, so during a solo set you really get to see a better view of who that individual artist is. Again, with Filter he really showed his style of dance and really embodied his song and the meaning of this song as he’s explained it before. By changing out his outfits and trying on different clothes during his performance he’s showing these different filters we put on based on who we are tryin to impress, interacting with or just to fit in to society. He also did a sensual contemporary, Latin inspired dance style which fit the song perfectly. He is the one member too, and this is common in contemporary not hip hop style, who really used his back up dancers to tell a story. Whether its through lifting him up or having them help him dress and undress he fully utilizes all the dancers on the stage while most artists just have them in the background. And obviously the man seriously looked LETHAL. He knew dang well what he was doing in the red and purple suit and doing some of those “movements”. He is a dancer, like Taemin, who is able to really be sensual without showing any skin (not that there’s anything wrong with that). As people famously say “to the demon who possesses Park Jimin on stage, thank you”. I’ll leave this answer with a gif of fully possessed Jimin."}]`),R={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"search-container"},N={class:"card-container"},P={key:0,class:"empty-state"},B=["disabled"],M={key:0},U={key:1};function j(i,e,h,m,n,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return o(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",C,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),f(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(o(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",N,[(o(!0),a(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,y)=>(o(),k(p,{key:y,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(o(),a("div",P,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
