To give your audience the best experience, it's important to break down the visual style of the movies you're spoofing and shoot it similarly if possible. This means paying attention to costumes, set design, and even camera angles to mimic the original as much as possible and make it feel like a true sequel. Beyond the visuals, it's important to give your actors characters to reference for their performance.

To keep the film quick-paced and engaging, it's important to aim for a high-paced tempo, particularly during comedic moments.

Use a natural deodorant. Wear breathable clothing.","completion":"When it comes to personal hygiene, there are few areas more important than the armpits. These small, often-overlooked regions of the body can easily become a breeding ground for bacteria and odors if left unchecked. Fortunately, with a few simple steps, you can keep your armpits clean, fresh, and smelling great all day long. The first step in maintaining good armpit hygiene is to wash them frequently. While this might seem obvious, many people don't pay enough attention to this area of the body. Be sure to use warm water and a mild soap, taking care to scrub your armpits thoroughly to remove any sweat or dirt that may have accumulated. Rinse well and dry with a clean towel. Next, consider switching to a natural deodorant. Unlike traditional deodorants, which can contain potentially harmful chemicals and artificial fragrances, natural deodorants are made with all-natural ingredients that are gentle on your skin and body. Look for products that contain ingredients like baking soda, arrowroot powder, and essential oils, which can help absorb sweat and neutralize odors. Finally, be mindful of the clothing you wear. Tight, synthetic fabrics can trap sweat and heat, creating the perfect environment for bacteria to thrive. Instead, opt for loose, breathable fabrics like cotton or linen that allow air to circulate around your armpits. You may also want to consider wearing undershirts or tank tops made from moisture-wicking materials that can help keep you dry. By following these simple tips, you can keep your armpits clean, fresh, and odor-free all day long. So the next time you hop in the shower, don't forget to give your armpits a little extra attention.

Learn how to interpret the barcode if the first digit is a 3. Learn about the final digit.","completion":"Barcodes have become an integral part of our daily lives, and their significance can’t be underestimated. They are used in many industries, including retail, manufacturing, and logistics, to help automate processes, track inventory, and make transactions faster and more accurate. If you need to find out more about a product or its origin, the barcode can provide you with all the required data. Here’s how you can look up most 12-digit barcodes online to get the information you need. Firstly, it’s important to understand some basic bar code principles. A barcode is a series of parallel lines that represents data in a machine-readable format. The width of each line, and the spaces between them, are different, and this creates a unique pattern that a barcode scanner can read. Barcodes are typically 12 digits long, with each digit representing a specific piece of data about the product. If the first digit of a barcode is a 3, this usually means that the product was produced in North America. The next five digits are the manufacturer code, and the following five digits are the product identifier. This information can be used to find out more about the product, including its origin, manufacturer, and other relevant details. Finally, the last digit of a barcode is known as the check digit. This digit is used to ensure that the barcode has been scanned correctly. If the check digit doesn’t match with the expected value, this indicates that there may be an error with the barcode, and it will need to be rescanned. In conclusion, barcodes are a fundamental part of modern-day commerce, and understanding how to read and interpret them can be incredibly useful. By looking up most 12-digit barcodes online, you can find out a wealth of information about a product, including its origin, manufacturer, and other important details. Remember to check the first digit to see if the product was made in North America, and pay attention to the check digit to ensure that the barcode has been scanned correctly."},{"prompt":"Use the following highlights to write an article: Rocker played first ever gig at Leeds Arena, promoted by local officials.

Frederick occupied Dresden with little or no opposition from the Saxons. At the Battle of Lobositz on 1 October 1756, Frederick prevented the isolated Saxon army from being reinforced by an Austrian army under General Browne. The Prussians then occupied Saxony; after the Siege of Pirna, the Saxon army surrendered in October 1756, and was forcibly incorporated into the Prussian army. The attack on neutral Saxony caused outrage across Europe and led to the strengthening of the antiPrussian coalition. The only significant Austrian success was the partial occupation of Silesia. Far from being easy, Frederick's early successes proved indecisive and very costly for Prussia's smaller army. This led him to remark that he did not fight the same Austrians as he had during the previous war.

Many species annually migrate great distances. Birds are social, communicating with visual signals, calls, and bird songs, and participating in such social behaviours as cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and mobbing of predators. The vast majority of bird species are socially monogamous, usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, but rarely for life. Other species have polygynous (many females) or, rarely, polyandrous (many males) breeding systems. Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilized through sexual reproduction. They are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching. Some birds, such as hens, lay eggs even when not fertilized, though unfertilized eggs do not produce offspring. Please answer a question about this article.

This means that each generation, each human genome accumulates 1–2 new mutations. Small mutations can be caused by DNA replication and the aftermath of DNA damage and include point mutations in which a single base is altered and frameshift mutations in which a single base is inserted or deleted. Either of these mutations can change the gene by missense (change a codon to encode a different amino acid) or nonsense (a premature stop codon). Larger mutations can be caused by errors in recombination to cause chromosomal abnormalities including the duplication, deletion, rearrangement or inversion of large sections of a chromosome.

It does get a bit more substantive after a while, but all characters are still cartoonish. Salma is the exotic beauty. Richard Harris is an evil and sexually repressed Frollo, fiending to bust a nut up in Salma. The other characters, including Quasimodo are quite forgettable. Its also a sorta liberal version of the story, Frollo is a suppressor of Enlightenment ideals, like the abbot in 'Name of the Rose', and Quasimodo is a champion of liberty. The shadowy side of the Quas character is ignored, though he does pour liquid led on people. He is really only an outsider in that he looks different and enjoys playing with bells more than the average person. Perhaps the film is intended for children, but I doubt it, considering Frollo flogs himself bloody to amend wanting to spank his monkey.

But on October 4th, 2012, Orlando Cruz shattered preconceptions and made history when he publicly announced that he was gay, becoming the first openly gay professional boxer. Cruz, a Puerto Rican featherweight competitor, had been open about his sexuality within his personal life for years, but it wasn't until 2012 that he felt the time was right to share his truth with the world. \\"I developed physically and mentally to take such a big step in my life and in my profession, which is boxing, knowing that it would have pros and cons, highs and lows in this sport that is so macho,\\" Cruz said in a public statement. The decision was met with a mix of support and backlash. While some praised Cruz for his bravery and honesty, others criticized him for his sexual orientation and questioned whether he could still be a \\"real\\" boxer. But Cruz refused to let the negativity bring him down. Instead, he channeled his energy into the sport he loved, and continued to compete with a newfound sense of pride and confidence. Since coming out, Cruz has become an advocate for LGBTQ+ athletes, and has used his platform to raise awareness about issues facing the community. He has also continued to compete at a high level and has become an inspiration to countless individuals around the world. In a sport where homophobia and hyper-masculinity are still prevalent, Orlando Cruz's decision to come out has had a profound impact, helping to break down barriers and challenge stereotypes.

Its original name Honovere may mean high (river)bank, though this is debated (cf. das Hohe Ufer). Hanover was a small village of ferrymen and fishermen that became a comparatively large town in the 13th century due to its position at a natural crossroads. As overland travel was relatively difficult, its position on the upper navigable reaches of the river helped it to grow by increasing trade. It was connected to the Hanseatic League city of Bremen by the Leine, and was situated near the southern edge of the wide North German Plain and northwest of the Harz mountains, so that eastwest traffic such as mule trains passed through it. Hanover was thus a gateway to the Rhine, Ruhr and Saar river valleys, their industrial areas which grew up to the southwest and the plains regions to the east and north, for overland traffic skirting the Harz between the Low Countries and Saxony or Thuringia.

The triode, however, was a fragile device that consumed a lot of power. Physicist Julius Edgar Lilienfeld filed a patent for a fieldeffect transistor (FET) in Canada in 1925, which was intended to be a solidstate replacement for the triode. Lilienfeld also filed identical patents in the United States in 1926 and 1928. However, Lilienfeld did not publish any research articles about his devices nor did his patents cite any specific examples of a working prototype. Because the production of highquality semiconductor materials was still decades away, Lilienfeld's solidstate amplifier ideas would not have found practical use in the 1920s and 1930s, even if such a device had been built.

Short (under five feet, or 152 cm), dark, bigeyed and a cigar smoker, she initially repelled Chopin, who remarked, What an unattractive person la Sand is. Is she really a woman?

Chopin finally placed the letters from Maria and her mother in a package on which he wrote, in Polish, My tragedy. Sand, in a letter to Grzymała of June 1838, admitted strong feelings for the composer and debated whether to abandon a current affair in order to begin a relationship with Chopin; she asked Grzymała to assess Chopin's relationship with Maria Wodzińska, without realising that the affair, at least from Maria's side, was over.

The first stage, known as sensitization, usually starts in childhood, and is marked by the child's becoming aware of samesex attractions.

In this stage, the youth is overwhelmed by feelings of inner turmoil regarding their sexual orientation, and begins to engage sexual experiences with samesex partners. In the third stage of identity assumption, which usually takes place a few years after the adolescent has left home, adolescents begin to come out to their family and close friends, and assumes a selfdefinition as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. In the final stage, known as commitment, the young adult adopts their sexual identity as a lifestyle.

Both have made significant contributions to their respective teams over the years. But how do their field goals compare? Specifically, how many yards difference was there between Lindell's second field goal and Nugent's field goal? To answer this question, we must first look at the game in which these two field goals were made. After some research, it was found that Lindell's second field goal was made during a game between the Buffalo Bills and the Cincinnati Bengals on October 2, 2011. Nugent's field goal, on the other hand, was made during a game between the New York Jets and the Cincinnati Bengals on November 25, 2010. With this information in mind, we can now calculate the difference in yards between the two field goals. Lindell's second field goal was made from 42 yards out, while Nugent's was made from 46 yards out. Therefore, the difference between the two field goals is four yards. It is important to note that while this may seem like a small difference, in the world of football, every yard counts. A field goal attempt can be the difference between a win and a loss, and kickers are often under a great deal of pressure to get the job done. In conclusion, Rian Lindell's second field goal was four yards closer than Mike Nugent's field goal. While this may not seem like a significant difference, it is a testament to the skills and accuracy of both kickers."},{"prompt":"What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? contrasting the sleekness of the film 's present with the playful paranoia of the film 's past OPTIONS: negative positive","completion":"The sentence does not express a sentiment, as it is a comparison between two different aspects of the film."},{"prompt":"Triple: Cotto eatType coffee shop; Cotto food Italian; Cotto customer rating low; Cotto near The Portland Arms What is a sentence that describes this triple?","completion":"Cotto is an Italian coffee shop with a low customer rating located near The Portland Arms."},{"prompt":"Workanedgearoundtheneckasfollowsfrommidontopofshoulder:1dc,*3ch,skipapprox.1cm,1dc*,repeatfrom**aroundtheentireneckandfinishwith1slstin1stdconround.

Sir William Jones proposed that Sanskrit, Persian, Greek, Latin, Gothic, and Celtic languages all shared a common base. After Jones, an effort to catalog all languages of the world was made throughout the 19th century and into the 20th century. Publication of Ferdinand de Saussure's Cours de linguistique générale created the development of descriptive linguistics. Descriptive linguistics, and the related structuralism movement caused linguistics to focus on how language changes over time, instead of just describing the differences between languages. Noam Chomsky further diversified linguistics with the development of generative linguistics in the 1950s. His effort is based upon a mathematical model of language that allows for the description and prediction of valid syntax. Additional specialties such as sociolinguistics, cognitive linguistics, and computational linguistics have emerged from collaboration between linguistics and other disciplines.

Act is 20 years old this week, a boon, but hasn't kept up with changing workplace she says. She says about 50% workers eligible for Act. And many can't afford to take unpaid time off. Walsh: Family leave insurance, for paid leave, has been shown to increase productivity.","completion":"The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) turned 20 years this week, and it has been a blessing for many families who can take time off from their job to take care of a sick family member. Janet Walsh is one of those grateful workers who were able to keep her job while taking care of her mom. However, Walsh points out that the FMLA has not kept up with the changing workplace. She estimates that only about 50% of workers are eligible for the Act, and many of them cannot afford to take unpaid time off. This is a crucial issue, as caregiving responsibilities fall mostly on women, who might struggle to maintain their work-life balance. To address this issue, Walsh suggests the implementation of family leave insurance, where workers can take paid time off to care for family members without having to worry about losing their job. Moreover, studies have shown that implementing paid family leave insurance increases productivity, reduces employee turnover, saves on training costs, and improves employee morale. In conclusion, while the FMLA has been a game-changer for many families, we must acknowledge the challenges it poses to those who cannot afford to take time off to care for their loved ones.

Whether you're washing your face or rinsing your hands, it's essential to take proper precautions to prevent any harm. Here are some tips for rinsing your skin safely and protecting your hands. Step 1: Rinse Your Skin with Water Before applying any cleansers, toners, or moisturizers, it's crucial to rinse your skin with water. This will help remove any dirt or grime and provide a clean surface for your products to work effectively. When rinsing your skin, make sure to use lukewarm water and avoid hot water, as it can strip your skin of its natural oils. Step 2: Put On Gloves If you want to protect your hands while rinsing your skin, it's best to wear gloves. Gloves will safeguard your hands from any harsh chemicals or irritants that may be present in some skincare products. Wearing gloves is especially important if you have sensitive or dry skin, as these types of skin are more prone to irritation. Choosing the right gloves is also essential. You can use latex or nitrile gloves, but if you're allergic to either of these materials, choose gloves made of vinyl or polyethylene. When putting on gloves, make sure they fit snugly, without being too tight or too loose. Step 3: Dry Your Skin After rinsing your skin, pat it dry with a clean towel. Avoid rubbing your skin, as this can cause irritation and damage. Make sure to choose a soft, absorbent towel to avoid any roughness that may scratch your skin. In conclusion, while you may think rinsing your skin with water is a simple task, it's important to take precautions to keep your hands safe. By wearing gloves and using clean, soft towels, you can keep your hands protected from any harsh chemicals or irritants that may be present in some skincare products. Remember, healthy skin doesn't have to mean sacrificing your hands."},{"prompt":"The student flaunted his test grade to his classmates. What is the cause of the preceding sentence?

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"In the wake of the tragic Sandy Hook shooting, gun control remains a hot topic across the United States. Recent developments suggest a growing interest in implementing stricter gun laws. One such development comes from Burlington, Vermont, where the city council has passed a resolution that could lead to an assault weapons ban. While the resolution is not binding, it sends a strong message about the city's stance on gun control and may pave the way for actual legislation. Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy has also taken a firm stance on gun control, stating that \\"more guns are not the answer.\\" This sentiment comes in response to calls for teachers and other school staff to be armed in order to prevent future tragedies. Malloy argues that adding more guns to schools could in fact make the situation worse. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart has reversed its decision to skip a Thursday meeting with Vice President Joe Biden regarding gun control. The retail giant initially cited a scheduling conflict, but has since agreed to attend the meeting. Wal-Mart is the largest firearms seller in the United States, making its involvement in the conversation crucial. Finally, a highly publicized petition calling for the deportation of CNN talk show host Piers Morgan has received a response from the White House. The petition, which gathered over 100,000 signatures, was created in response to Morgan's call for stricter gun laws in the wake of the Sandy Hook shooting. The White House responded by stating that Morgan's First Amendment rights must be protected and that the petition's call for deportation is not in line with American values. Overall, these developments suggest that the conversation surrounding gun control is far from over.

He claims to have saved hundreds of pounds in bars, restaurants and taxis. He said people are always asking him how they can get a similar card.","completion":"Richard Macrae's fake card, gifted to him on his 30th birthday, has resulted in significant savings for him. He claims to have saved hundreds of pounds whilst using it in bars, restaurants, and taxis. The curious case has even piqued the interest of acquaintances, who are now clamoring to discover how they can obtain similar deals. The deceptively simple card is a testament to the power of negotiation when it comes to saving money. What is interesting about Macrae's account is that companies are often willing to offer discounts when asked. However, it can be daunting to approach them and make such a request. The fake card, on the other hand, offers an easy inroad to savings without any of the anxiety associated with negotiating. Macrae has been reaping the benefits of using the card, and the experience has been eye-opening. The life lessons he has learned have been invaluable, and he has undoubtedly become a more shrewd and confident negotiator. But the practical applications of Macrae's tale are not the only significant takeaway from this story. The cultural norms that underpin the card are striking as well. Everyone wants to save money, and it is clear from the demand for similar cards that many people are feeling the pinch. As inflation rises and wages remain stagnant in some industries, people are looking for ways to make their money go further. Richard Macrae's story serves as a reminder that there are always ways to save on our everyday expenses. His experience shows us that even something as simple as asking for discounts can create significant savings. Perhaps we could all benefit from taking such an approach in our everyday lives. The fake card has taken on a life of its own, with many individuals expressing a desire to acquire it. Undoubtedly, one lesson we can all glean from Macrae's story is the power of social proof. When people see how much he has saved, it is natural to be curious about replicating the same results. All in all, Richard Macrae's tale serves as an excellent example of the benefits of negotiation, marketing, and social proof in our society. Its impact is wide-reaching, and it poses many interesting questions about consumer behavior and spending habits. Perhaps the most pertinent lesson is that we should never accept the first quoted price and that there is always room to ask for more."},{"prompt":"walked into Infiniti Creations and asked for Erica.

The world's largest senior citizen Wii bowling tournament took place in the city, and besides a fun day out, the seniors could also benefit from a health fair and immunization clinic. For those unfamiliar with the term, Wii bowling is a video game version of bowling using motion control technology. Although it may seem awkward at first, it provides a great exercise for the upper body, and it is said to help seniors develop or maintain balance and strength, which are essential for their health and wellbeing. The importance of maintaining balance and strength for seniors is imperative, as falls are the leading cause of injury-related death in this age group. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), one in four Americans aged 65 and older falls each year, and every 19 minutes, an older adult dies from a fall. Therefore, a light and fun activity like Wii bowling can have significant benefits for seniors. Besides the tournament, the health fair and immunization clinic also contributed to the event's success in promoting wellness. Preventative care is vital for seniors, and through the fair and the clinic, the participants had access to essential health screenings and preventive services. The senior citizen Wii bowling tournament in Houston serves as an essential reminder of the need to promote physical fitness and health for seniors. As aging takes its course, maintaining physical wellbeing becomes more challenging, but it is not impossible. Through creative and fun activities like Wii bowling and events that encourage and provide essential health services, we can help seniors improve and maintain their wellness."},{"prompt":"Read this and answer the question. If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable. In ancient China, early literature was primarily focused on philosophy, historiography, military science, agriculture, and poetry. China, the origin of modern paper making and woodblock printing, produced one of the world's first print cultures. Much of Chinese literature originates with the Hundred Schools of Thought period that occurred during the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (769269 BCE). The most important of these include the Classics of Confucianism, of Daoism, of Mohism, of Legalism, as well as works of military science (e.g. Sun Tzu's The Art of War) and Chinese history (e.g. Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian). Ancient Chinese literature had a heavy emphasis on historiography, with often very detailed court records.

This force is called a magnetic force. The force a magnet exerts is a little different from the forces you may normally think about. You exert a force on a book when you lift it. You also exert a force on the pedals of your bicycle. In both those cases, those forces cause a change. The change you see in both these cases is called motion. Magnets, too, can produce change. They can produce motion just like you do. Unlike you, magnets do not have to touch something to exert a force. A magnetic force is exerted over a distance. Thats right, a magnet can push or pull certain items without ever touching them. Thats how the maglev train works. Do you know another type of force that does not require objects to touch?

County row offices, which are positions such as clerk, recorder, and sheriff, are often overlooked in elections compared to higher profile races such as governor or senator. However, these offices can have a significant impact on the day-to-day operations of local government. According to data from Ballotpedia, as of 2021, Republicans held 2,336 county row offices across the United States, while Democrats held 2,321. This means that there are only 15 more county row offices held by Republicans than Democrats. It's important to note that these numbers can fluctuate depending on when the data was collected and which offices were included in the analysis. The split between parties varies by state. In some states, such as Texas and Oklahoma, Republicans hold the vast majority of county row offices. Meanwhile, in states like Massachusetts and Hawaii, Democrats hold most of the positions. In other states, such as New York and Pennsylvania, the split is relatively even. The reasons behind this split are complex and varied. Factors such as the political climate in a particular state, the quality of candidates running for office, and the demographics of the electorate can all play a role. Regardless of which party holds more county row offices, it's important for voters to pay attention to these races. The people elected to these positions can have a significant impact on the services provided by local government. For example, a well-run county clerk's office can help ensure that elections are conducted fairly and efficiently. On the other hand, a poorly-run recorder's office can cause delays and headaches for people trying to obtain important documents like property deeds or birth certificates. In conclusion, the number of county row offices held by Republicans and Democrats is pretty evenly split across the United States. While the reasons for this divide can vary, voters should pay attention to these races as the people elected to these positions can have a significant impact on the functioning of local government."},{"prompt":"Write a dialog with this premise Rachel has already sent the Newcastle invoice for Taylors.

Kant denies that either space or time are substance, entities in themselves, or learned by experience; he holds, rather, that both are elements of a systematic framework we use to structure our experience. Spatial measurements are used to quantify how far apart objects are, and temporal measurements are used to quantitatively compare the interval between (or duration of) events.

These items will still provide a polished appearance, but will also allow for more comfort throughout the day. Pair your pants with a button down shirt for a clean and classic look.

They neither expected nor sought the appearance of the stigmata or any other physical manifestation. They wanted to create in themselves that environment that allowed Jesus to fulfill His divine mission, insofar as they were able. At the center of this environment was love: the love that Christ showed for humanity in becoming human. Christ's love reveals the mercy of God and His care for His creation. English Dominican mystics sought through this love to become images of God. Love led to spiritual growth that, in turn, reflected an increase in love for God and humanity. This increase in universal love allowed men's wills to conform to God's will, just as Christ's will submitted to the Father's will.

It can also be used to produce electricity. This conversion is made possible by solar cells. However, solar energy may not always be practical. Some areas are just too cloudy.

Its energy can be converted into kinetic energy. This energy can turn a turbine and generate electricity. The water may fall naturally over a waterfall or flow through a dam. A drawback of dams is that they flood land upstream. They can also reduce water flow downstream. Either effect may harm ecosystems. Wind Wind is moving air. It has kinetic energy that can do work.

I am writing to you today to discuss the difficulty of following directions. As we go about our daily lives, we are presented with a variety of instructions and guidelines that we are expected to follow. From the simplest of tasks to the most complex, following directions is a fundamental part of our daily routine. However, as we have all experienced at one point or another, following directions is much easier said than done. Despite our best efforts, we often find ourselves struggling to follow even the most straightforward directions. Whether it is due to distractions, confusion, or forgetfulness, the reasons for our difficulty in following directions are many. In light of this, I believe it is important that we recognize the challenges that come with following directions and work to overcome them. By doing so, we can all become more effective at completing tasks and achieving our goals. Thank you for taking the time to read this email.

A conservatism that emphasizes cutting social benefits risks appearing harsh, he says. Zelizer: Reagan insisted conservatism be packaged as a positive force for freedom. He says Democratic presidents have gained by depicting GOP as the party of meanness.","completion":"The recent troubles of former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney reflect a larger problem that the GOP has been grappling with for years, according to Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. The problem, Zelizer notes, is the conservative emphasis on cutting social benefits, which can make the party appear harsh and mean-spirited. Zelizer points to former President Ronald Reagan as an example of a conservative leader who understood the importance of packaging conservatism as a positive force for freedom. Reagan emphasized the need for smaller government, lower taxes, and greater individual responsibility, but he did so in a way that resonated with voters and inspired them to believe in the power of conservative principles. In recent years, however, the conservative movement has struggled to replicate Reagan's success. Instead, many Republican leaders have focused on cutting social benefits and reducing the size of government, without adequately articulating a positive vision for the future. As a result, Democratic presidents have been able to gain political capital by depicting the GOP as the party of meanness and selfishness. Zelizer notes that President Barack Obama was particularly successful in framing the 2012 presidential election as a choice between a party that values public sacrifice and a party that prioritizes private gain. Zelizer's analysis highlights the importance of messaging in contemporary politics. While policies and ideas are undoubtedly important, they must be packaged in a way that resonates with voters and inspires them to believe in the power of those ideas. If the GOP hopes to regain its footing in national politics, it will need to find a way to balance its commitment to conservative principles with a more positive, aspirational message that speaks to voters from all walks of life."},{"prompt":"What is the answer to this question? what mysteries of the rosary is said after easter?","completion":"The mysteries of the rosary that are said after Easter are the Glorious mysteries."},{"prompt":"Data: name = The Eagle, customer rating = 5 out of 5.
