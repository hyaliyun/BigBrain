What will be the consequences?","completion":"First of all, let me clarify that the currency value of a country doesn't necessarily mean the strength of that economy. If that were to be the case, then the Bangladeshi economy would've been stronger than the Japaneseeconomy as 1 Bangladeshi Taka is equal to 1.4 Japanese Yen. Now let's envision what would have happened if 1 rupee equals to 1 dollar, w.r.t. the India, Pros of the situation:1) First of all buying goods will be cheaper as the price of imports will be cheaper.2)Buying luxury goods will also be cheaper - you can easily buy an I-Phone 7 for Rs.542!3) As imports would be cheaper, this would reduce the price of petrol and diesel, leading to low transportation costs. Cons of the situation:But on the other side of the coin, the story is totally different.1) Exports will fall, as they'll become expensive and why would any country buy our products if they can get it through other countries at a cheaper rate.2) There will also be a decrease in foreign investment as investing in our country will become expensive as compared to other countries. One of the main reasons why foreign countries invest in India is because of the cheap price.3) Also, the unemployment rate will go up, as few would hire an Indian at Rs.75,000 if they can get an outsider at 3000.4) Many companies will move out of India as their expenses will be high, and their businesses non-profitable.5) Even your maid, with a salary of, say Rs.4,000 can buy seven I-Phone 7! This can be clearly seen that if 1 rupee would've been equal to 1 dollar, there would've been a high unemployment rate and a slower economic growth, because of lesser foreign investment. Thus, the situation of a rupee being equal to a dollar is not affordable for a growing and a developing economy like India. A similar situation occurred in 2007-08 when 1 dollar was equal to about Rs 41. At that time, imports of the country was good, but the exports and the IT sector got affected a lot. INR vs. US in 2011-12Source: Google Now you will say what if we buy swadeshi (domestic) products only and boycott foreign goods.This situation would also not work, as it was a regular practice till 1990 when we used to use our own products. Since then, however, our economy has grown manifold, and if we boycott the goods of other nations, they may also boycott Indian goods! Another developing nation, China, has adopted the fixed exchange rate system, in which they decide the value of their currency with respect to the U.S. dollar, and whenever they want to increase their exports, they just depreciate the value of their currency (Yuan). The value of the INR from 1 in 1947 to 61 in 2014 to over 65 today! (w.r.t. the US) The falling value of the rupee (up to a certain extent) doesn't worry our Finance Minister and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor. They are more worried about the fluctuations of the rupee. If the value of the rupee yesterday was 60 and 70 today, there is too much fluctuations in the currency, which will have an adverse effect on the stability of the Indian economy. India has adopted the floating exchange rate system (since 1975). In the floating system, the value of the currency can't be determined by the RBI Governor, the Finance Minister or the government, it is determined by the currency demand & supply that prevails in the market. But still, the Finance Minister has some control over policy and foreign reserves, through which he tries to maintain a constant value of the rupee, by controlling the inflation rate, and in the process, prevents the currency from getting completely destroyed. Now lets come to reality, today 1 dollar is more than 65 rupees. As Indians, we do want our currency to be at a higher rate but at what cost? The cost of it, at this point in time, is too high (higher unemployment, lower economic growth and lower foreign investment). We can challenge the dollar later but first let our economy grow and don't forget what I mentioned above- cost of currency does not necessarily signify the strength of an economy."},{"prompt":"What are the best freelancing sites?","completion":"There are many freelancing sites to choose from, depending on your specific needs.

Both had “slept around” before settling on each other. While engaged they found out sister was pregnant. He accepted responsibility until his parents said he may not be father. Close to birth, he told sister that he had no obligations to her. Couple weeks later, I convinced him to come to the birth and share the moment with her. I talked to him privately about how he treated her before discovering her pregnancy. He said daily how he loved her. I listed her small support group and asked if he would support someone he loved and to just think about it. Week after birth, paternity test revealed that he was father, and by now he was fully prepared to accept responsibility. I hope that love and responsibility are more relevant in people's lives than selfish.

In addition to herbal remedies, ayurveda recommends lifestyle modifications and dietary changes for diabetes management. These include: • Limiting carbohydrate intake: Eating a low-carbohydrate diet can help to control blood sugar levels. • Increasing physical activity: Regular exercise can help to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications. • Avoiding processed and fried foods: Eating a diet that is high in fresh fruits and vegetables can help to improve overall health. • Limiting sugar intake: Eating too much sugar can cause blood sugar levels to spike. • Practicing yoga and meditation: These activities can help to reduce stress and improve overall health.

Here are some points on the realism of thorium-based nuclear reactors, based on the relevant laws and principles: Thorium is a naturally occurring, abundant, and relatively cheap element that can be used as a nuclear fuel. It has several advantages over uranium, such as a higher energy density and a lower risk of nuclear proliferation. Thorium can also be used as a fuel in different types of reactors, including molten salt reactors and high-temperature gas-cooled reactors.Thorium-based reactors are inherently safer and more stable than traditional uranium-based reactors. Thorium is a fertile material that can be converted into a fissile material through a process called breeding. Breeding thorium can produce uranium-233, which can be used as fuel in a reactor. Unlike uranium-based reactors, thorium-based reactors can be designed to shut down automatically in the event of a power failure or other emergency.Thorium-based reactors can produce less nuclear waste and have a shorter half-life than traditional reactors. This is because thorium produces fewer long-lived, highly radioactive isotopes when it is used as fuel. Additionally, thorium-based reactors can consume some of the nuclear waste produced by traditional reactors, further reducing the amount of nuclear waste that needs to be stored or disposed of.Thorium-based reactors have the potential to be more efficient and cost-effective than traditional reactors. Thorium can produce more energy per unit of fuel than uranium, which can reduce the overall cost of nuclear energy. Additionally, thorium-based reactors can operate at higher temperatures, which can increase their thermal efficiency and reduce their environmental impact. In conclusion, thorium-based nuclear reactors are a realistic and promising technology that could provide a sustainable and reliable source of energy. However, further research and development are needed to optimize the design and operation of these reactors, as well as to address technical challenges such as the development of a suitable neutron source to kickstart the reaction and the management of nuclear waste."},{"prompt":"What oscillator circuit is the best for DIY function generator? So, we've learned on my lectures about 555 timer circuit, RC, RL, opamp oscillators, and I was wondering, which one should I use to make a decent DIY function generator?","completion":"Most modern carriers are in the GHz range and with multidimensional arrays, so a good many of the VCO (voltage-controlled oscillators), OCO (oven-controlled oscillator) and FSK (frequency shift key) generators {and consequently Wave Form Generators}, today are of a custom design.

There is no God, the Creator, and no soul for Gautama, and in Buddhism. Spirituality begins with spiritual awakening. Awakening can lead to enlightenment. These processes take many years to the end of earthly life. Gautama and his alleged spiritual awakening - under a tree?! God is the Almighty, Endless, All-Encompassing Spirit and the Only Source of everything Spiritual. Awakening and enlightenment are the greatest gifts from the Almighty and All-Knowing Spirit/ Consciousness/ God - and can come Only from Him - if one lives (thinks, talks, and acts) according the highest commandments of God - and only in that case. Gautama alias Buddha was a demon/ satan* (* terms vary, depending on Scripture), or he stood under their influence. Their task is to prevent people from believing in God. They are not all (physically) cruel. Many of them are very polite. The job of some of them is to bind people to the earth and transience (=mortality) with false promises and thus prevent them from believing in God and eternal life in \\"heaven\\", i.e., to prevent the salvation of souls. But those who seek peace, rest, freedom, and happiness on earth will never find it. It is an illusion. This world was not created for that purpose. That's why Gautama (never enlightened one/ Buddha) founded an earthly \\"life philosophy\\" according to which there is NO Almighty God and no soul. The awakened men renounce/ leave/ forsake this world, its people (normal/ ordinary living people), and also their closest blood relatives. They no longer belong to any community, association, organization, party, nation ... If they were to be together and communicate with the ordinary people (= their worldly duties fulfilling people) again, that would bring them back to this world, and they would lose their awakening. For this reason, they live alone, but not lonely, and not in the monasteries, ashrams, ... with many others. Living in a monastery cannot lead to awakening; that is not enough. Gautama has left/ rejected the Vedic Teaching, the Teaching of God because he did not understand anything/ because God did not let him know anything. In doing so, Gautama misused a considerable part of the Vedic Teaching, changed it (in some issues more, in others less), and integrated it into his earthly teaching. The earthly (incl. the earthly way of thinking) is called the demonic; in other Scriptures of God also the devilish, animalistic, and the dead. Earth is a symbol of ignorance, darkness, and death. Heaven is a symbol of Recognition, Light, and Life. The teachings and philosophies, which were developed according to the earthly way of thinking, can be understood by many people (to some extent). But that is something for the ignorant Shudras and Vaishyas; for the people who fulfill their worldly duties, as revealed in the Vedas. Gautama was (according to earthly criteria) intelligent and eloquent, as are most false, spiritless gurus, priests, theologians, \\"scholars\\" and the like, but that has not the least to do with faith in God, religion, and spirituality. Gautama’s teaching is interesting and \\"good\\" only for fleshly/ unspiritual and soulless people (as Gautama was) who want to live modestly and decently on earth in peace, tranquility, and contentment. But - exactly for this reason - for people who have a soul and COULD believe in the hereafter, in God, and eternal life, it is one of the worst and most misleading teaching ever. No Brahmin has ever believed in Gautama, let alone followed such a being. Those were only Shudras/ so-called Brahmins, who were considered Brahmins according to the stupid earthly way of thinking of the ignorant because they were born (incarnated) in so-called Brahmin families. But there exists no Brahmin family on earth – as it has been unequivocally explained in the Vedas. According to Vedic Teaching/ Teaching of God, Shudras are people who have no Knowledge or who have little knowledge about God, although they can be (in earthly matters) the highest scientists, Nobel prize winners ... It has nothing to do (as the ignorant think) with one's family affiliation/ blood relationship, the profession one practices, and the like. A Self becomes a Brahmin only after the fourth stage of life (after Sannyasa - Ashrama), i.e., a long time after it has left his earthly (fleshly) family, which consists of Shudras and Vaishyas. A Brahmin belongs to God, and no longer to this world and its people, i.e., the blood relationship also plays no more role. Only in that way, a Self can become a Brahmin; otherwise, one remains a Shudra or Vaishya, as the earthly-family-members. That has nothing to do with blood relationship/ family affiliation, profession, etc. It is exclusively about spiritual development. According to the Vedic Teaching, a Self becomes a Kshatriya, a warrior who begins to wage war against his own lusts, desires, and earthly needs and attachments/ to wage war to overcome them. Then begins the third stage of life (Vanaprastha Ashrama), when the man leaves his earthly family and society, retreats into solitude, intensively studies the Scriptures, and lives (thinks, talks, and acts) according to the Highest commandments of God. That is the only way. Kshatriyas no longer belong to any association, organization, party, nation ... If they were to communicate with the ordinary people again, that would bring them back to this world, and they would lose their awakening. For this reason, they live alone, but not lonely. Only then does one begin to understand the Scriptures in a heavenly way, i.e., receiving Recognition/ Knowledge from God. The earthly way of thinking and understanding, earthly rationality and logic (such as the middle path of Gautama) are for the Shudras and Vaishyas = for fleshly, unspiritual, earth-bound people. The vast majority of the Hindus and their highly esteemed, world-renowned gurus and priests have no idea about that because they are fleshly (unspiritual) Shudras or Vaishyas. On the other hand, according to some Hindu Shudra scriptures, the soulless Gautama (some people know they have no soul) is even supposed to be an incarnation of God on earth?! In another context, in Hindu-Shudra-scriptures, he is even said to have taught the 33 gods. A Shudra who did not believe (let alone know) that there is a God?! That is simply unmatched nonsense. And the Brahmins are supposed to have called him \\"My Lord\\"?! That is idiocy. And according to some Puranas, many Hindus call him \\"Mahatma\\", i.e., the \\"great soul\\"?! A soulless Shudra who did not even believe in the existence of the soul (because he had none) should be a \\"great soul\\"?! These are simply hair-raising stupidities and ignorance without equality. And Gautama left his family and his first child, a just-born son. According to Vedic Teachings (and all other God's Scriptures), one must leave one's earthly family in the third stage of life (Vanaprastha Ashrama) and devote oneself entirely to God, but only after the children have become self-sufficient. \\"Gautama's\\" four noble truths? Many people find it high, \\"noble truths\\". But that is primitivism and ignorance of a Shudra. He has taken these four Truths from the Vedic Teaching/ Teaching of God and declared them noble ones. All the Truths of God are noble, and no Shudra is allowed to declare some of them as noble and others as non-noble. Although they have brains, most people cannot evaluate anything. Among the Selves considered to be Shudras, there are some true Brahmins. All the Selves who are considered Brahmins according to blood relationship are true Shudras or at most Vaishyas (= ignorant ones) Many people read God's Scriptures, even professionally, such as so-called theologians, scholars, gurus, priests, imams, etc. But none of them can understand and adopt, i.e., receive any heavenly Recognition until they start to live (think, speak, and act) according to God's supreme commandments, i.e. renounce and leave this world and devote/ submit their will to the Will of God. All of the mentioned gentlemen, after all, live in ordinary circumstances and therefore can never comprehend/ adopt/ receive anything of the heavenly. Knowledge. Heavenly Recognitions/ Knowledge is the greatest gift of God, which He bestows only to His faithful servants who devote themselves to Him entirely, i.e., who adopt and follow His highest commandments. And this Knowledge of God is not transferable to other persons. That can come only from God. If I remind \\"1000\\" people of the Teaching of God, I cannot teach anyone because only God can enable a person to understand and adopt His Words. For this reason, God is the Only Teacher, as it was said in all His Scriptures. But Shudra-people like to pretend to be \\"studied scholars\\", gurus, theologians, teachers, priests, imams, and the like and to spread their foolishness and ignorance. They are all ignorant Shudras (or Vaishyas) from whom one cannot hear anything reasonable. The following thought-provoking question was posted by an anonymous: \\"Gautama doesn't believe in God but believes in rebirth. He believes in rebirth but not in the soul!? Was he mad?\\" Conclusion: For Gautama/ for Buddhists, there is no God even though only He can give the Recognitions/ Knowledge/ Spirit and no soul although only soul can receive the Recognitions/ Knowledge/ Spirit and thus Awakening and Enlightenment. Gautama was really ignorant/ stupid/ mad. __________________________________________________________________________ Only God can awake a man from earthly sleep, and then He begins to reveal divine Knowledge to him. Because God's Knowledge and Wisdom are infinite, this process lasts until the end of earthly life. That leads to enlightenment. God has said/ confirmed that in all His Scriptures. Even after the earthly life, those with Him/in Him never get all His Knowledge because no one can be equal to Him. HE was, is, and remains the Secondless, the Highest, the Supreme, the Absolute - Forever. ______________________________________________________________________________ - The Vedic Teaching/ Teaching of GOD The Chandogya Upanishad \\"When one RECOGNISES something, he speaks the TRUTH; he who does not recognize does not speak the truth; only he who recognizes speaks the truth. Recognition, therefore, one must seek to recognize.\\" Ninth Khanda: And he (student) came to the abode of the teacher (guru). Then the teacher addressed him and said, \\"Satyakama!\\" - \\"Venerable!\\" he replied. - You shine, my dear, like one who knows Brahman. Who can it be who has taught you?\\" \\"OTHER THAN HUMANS*\\", he replied; \\"but Your Honors may explain it to me, please. For I have heard men like Your Eminence say that knowledge which one learns FROM THE TEACHER leads the surest/straightest to the goal.\\" (This TEACHER is \\"OTHER THAN HUMANS,\\" and His Teaching leads most surely/ straightest to the goal. This is Brahman/ Atman/ God. He is the Only true Teacher. But only a few (true) Vedic Selves recognize this (in contrary to innumerable so-called Hindus), whom God/ Brahman lets recognize it, in contrast to the masses who seek earthly teachers/ gurus and remain with them in Samsara; in ignorance, darkness and death - until the definite downfall/ perdition. They are the teachers/ gurus/ priests of the masses. God personally gave them to the masses because He wants to keep the masses away from Himself/ from His salvation-bringing Teachings through such gurus. After all, they deserve such teachers/ gurus/ priests.) In an Upanishad unknown to most of you, God said: \\"If I find anything good in your hearts, if I find virtue in you, I will give you more than has been taken from you, and I will forgive you.\\" (i.e., I will set you free/ save you = Moksha.) That kind of Selves God seeks among the masses - to save them. The Kathaka Upanishad (or Katha) Not by instruction* is the Atman attained, (* from an earthly guru) Not by understanding and many scriptural teachings; ONLY whom He CHOOSES, by him He is comprehended: To HIM the Atman makes MANIFEST His being. (Whoever wishes to receive knowledge from Him, to become a true Vedic man, Veda knower, must walk/ go through all four stages of life (Ashramas). Only through that one can reach Brahman.) Everything else is only theoretical knowledge/ book stuff. Just as well, one can read science fiction, belletristic or similar instead of God's Scriptures. These four stages of development (Ashramas) correspond to the four castes (Varnas). According to Vedic Teaching/ Teaching of God, Shudras are people who have no Knowledge or who have little knowledge about God, although they can be (in earthly matters) the highest scientists, Nobel prize winners ... It has nothing to do (as the ignorant think) with one's family affiliation/ blood relationship, the profession one practices, and the like. He who does not ABSOLVE ALL FOUR stages of life/ development (four Ashramas) remains a true Shudra or Vaishya - until his definite perishing. The Paramahamsa Upanishad Who, giving up all lusts, In the SECONDLESS, in the SUPREME, stand, Carrying only Recognition as his rod, He is rightly called the one-rod-man. (I love this expression \\"The SECONDLESS\\". There is no better way to emphasize that He is ONE. Do not be misled by many of His attributes, aspects, functions, names, and forms of His appearances.) - The Bhagavad Gita The Teaching is available to everyone, but it is meant for and understood ONLY by the WORTHY. ... According to Vedic Teaching, there are four ages/ stages of man: \\"Brahmacharya\\" - disciple, \\"Grihastha\\" - family man, \\"Vanaprastha\\" - hermit, and \\"Sannyasa\\" - ascetic. If one understands this interpretation of action and takes just a few steps further - which one can do even in his third stage of life - then the seed of action is sown forever, and this seed can never be destroyed. O Arjuna! Then nothing on earth, not even a weapon, can refute this seed, that is, this Truth. Arjuna was Kshatriya. The Exalted One spurs him to become a brahmin. Brahmin and Kshatriya are our innate qualities. Our courses of action determine our dispositions. This cannot be inherited by tradition, by virtue of our birth into a certain family. He who has seen the soul face to face is the true Brahmin. ... This soul of yours is omniscient and undestroyable. The soul is undestroyable, except it everything is destroyable. Offering fire to the gods, living an ascetic life, performing a sacrifice for thousands of years - all that is in vain if you do not know the undestroyable. Ignorant, he dies, and with him, I have pity because he is really poor. (Like Gautama) \\"O Arjuna! If one cannot renounce the world and must remain attached to everything, then one cannot act selflessly. And this is a cause of affliction.\\" If you do not take even the first step on the path of yoga, then this is impossible. \\"He who meditates on the Exalted, whose mind and senses have settled, such a meditator, by the power of karma-yoga, can shortly attain to the Absolute.\\" \\"He who performs all his deeds devoted to the Supreme and dwelling in the Supreme, who acts abandoning all his worldly attachments, his actions do not shackle him. As a lotus flower remains untouched by the mud.\\" You must have noticed that the dirty water surrounds the lotus flowers day and night, but the lotus flowers floating on the water are not even touched by a drop of water. Thus, the godlike one lives in the world but is redeemed from worldly bonds. He acts for the good of humanity, for his descendants. \\"The yogi acts by renouncing their senses, their spirit, their mind, and also their body.\\" The soul: \\"It does show itself, in the hour of passing away, and also when the body enjoys the sense objects due to the three Gunas, but the soul is not recognized by the ignorant foolish. Verily, it is recognized only by those who possess the special, knowledgeable power of sight.\\" How does one obtain this sight? \\"The yogis experience the striving soul when they are in the process of taming their mind. But the unfinished souls, i.e., those with an impure interior, cannot see, despite their efforts, because they are still CONSTRAINED WITH THE WORLDLY THINGS. Only the pure are capable of this sight. God says further in the Bhagavad Gita: Never tell of this Teaching of the Gita, revealed only for your benefit, to one who does not practice asceticism and who is not devoted. Nor to one who does not listen or speaks ill of Me or objects to this Teaching. This secret Teaching is not meant for everyone at random, but only for the privileged, worthy, loving believers. It is not intended for others, considered ordinary people who fulfill their worldly tasks and duties. Think only of Me, believe only in Me, be only faithfully devoted to Me, so devoted that tears come to your eyes when you pay homage (especially at prayer), and offer your homage only to Me, then you will surely reach Me. This I truly promise you. The average/ ordinary man does not reach this state. The average/ ordinary man does not reach the Highest. Whoever worships Me lovingly and imparts this Teaching to My followers will reach Me. Among people, no one is dearer to Me than the one who spreads this Teaching. (Caution: only to the worthy ones.) By performing the true prayer unceasingly, the spirit experiences a constant upsurge. For a better understanding of this stanza, the meanings of the following words will help us: Brahmanvit: one who recognizes Brahman, an enlightened one for whom God has become real. Vidvar: a high-minded one (one on the second level. Vidvishta: a High Scholar (one on the third level. Vidvarishta: a Most Highly Venerable One, one who has experienced the highest recognition of the Divine. With the help of these words, let us now try to understand the following passage. In the first stage, the mind is called Brahmanvit, i.e. the mind that recognizes the Brahman. After eliminating the debilities, it gradually reaches the stage of Brahmanvidvar, i.e., the high-minded one. With still further ascent, the mind refines itself and then reaches the state of Brahmanvidvarishta, i.e., the state of the most high-minded. Now the one with the most exalted mind is entitled to help others to ascend. (Only one who is at this stage of development can help others to ascend. Only he is a Guru. And he can only give advice. But the receiver cannot understand and adopt anything if God/ Brahman does not want that.) The highest degree of mind is attained by the Brahmanvidvarishta, i.e., those who have experienced the arising in Brahman. The Secret Teaching is not meant for everyone, but only for the privileged, worthy, loving believers. But not for the other, normal/ ordinary people fulfilling their worldly duties. They will never be able to see Him. There are only two kinds of beings: the imperishable and the perishable. Perishable beings are those who wander in the world as birthing and perishing bodies - may they be seen in the male or female bodies. On the other hand, the IMMORTAL state of the Purusha appears only after he has acquired the exalted Knowledge and progresses. Perishable and imperishable are the two kinds of people. To the first belong those condemned to DEATH, and only the imperishable is immutable. He who remains the same by virtue of his tamed spirit and the tamed senses, only he is imperishable. This one belongs to the HUMAN SORT. Beyond that, there is still One/ Better than the two, however, is still One, the All-Best, who permeates the three worlds, sustains and nourishes them. He is the imperishable, exalted One. He is God. \\"In all the universe, none is dear to me, and none is disgusting to me. But my believer DWELLS IN ME and I IN HIM. That is the ONLY family relationship I recognize. This I call the PERFECTION, then the believer stands at no distance to Me.\\" All beings and things that are sattvic, rajasic, or tamasic originate from Me. They are in Me, but I am not in them. \\"From my unmanifested being, the whole world is permeated,\\" i.e., in my primordial form, I am omnipresent. \\" All beings dwell in me, but I am not in them. For I am in my unmanifested form.\\" \\"Actually, all beings do not dwell in me, for they are mortal and dependent on nature. So, recognize the magnificent power of my Yoga-Maya.\\" He said: \\"I, who am the origin and nourisher of all beings, but do not dwell in them, for I am the Supreme Being, and they do not arrest me.\\" \\"But the STUPID PEOPLE, immersed in pleasures, worship, instead of Me, other NON-EXISTENT GODS. But in order to STRENGTHEN their devotional faith, I, assisting them, accept their prayers addressed to stone-trees-waters and reward them. But the GODS ARE NOT, and NEITHER IS THE REWARD.\\" (He too misleads many people. You will see the same practice in the Gospels and in the Quran/ Koran, too – here below quoted. He strengthens them, giving them good feelings and in their satanic meditations, so they believe that it is good and valuable for them. However, they do not know what the word \\"meditation\\" really means and how to perform it.) Krishna said, \\" Starting from Brahma to all living beings, all are subject of rebirth. Even at the end of all this, you cannot count on the remission of births.\\" \\"Krishna\\" means \\"one of dark color skin \\". Therefore, the name \\"Krishna\\" is unsuitable/ inappropriate for Him. One must not take Him for an earthly/ ordinary person (of any skin color). Krishna said, \\"To end suffering, one thing has TO BE DONE: let go of the attitude that it is about ME. It isn't. It was, is, and ALWAYS WILL BE about GOD."},{"prompt":"What is the string theory about?","completion":"Don’t bother, it’s on its way out."},{"prompt":"Why didn’t my daughter get her growth spurt even though she got her period?","completion":"How old is your daughter? i know girls grow faster than boys."},{"prompt":"Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah lost its charm after several cast members left?","completion":"Show has been affected very much, specially after Disha ma'am left…."},{"prompt":"What are the disadvantages a person can have after becoming a member of a Freemason?","completion":"Be coming possessed"},{"prompt":"A modern submarine has a very small galley; even smaller than the kitchen in my apartment.

However, there are several factors that have been identified as potential contributors to unhappiness or dissatisfaction among certain individuals or groups within a generation. Here are a few possible reasons why some people in our generation may feel unhappy: High expectations: Our generation has grown up in a time of rapid technological advancements, societal changes, and increasing globalization. With these changes come higher expectations and pressure to succeed in various aspects of life, such as education, career, and personal achievements. Striving to meet these high expectations can lead to stress and dissatisfaction when goals are not met. Economic challenges: Many individuals in our generation have faced economic challenges, such as student loan debt, limited job opportunities, and rising living costs. These financial pressures can lead to stress, anxiety, and a sense of insecurity about the future, which can contribute to unhappiness. Social media and comparison: Social media has become an integral part of our lives, allowing us to connect with others and share experiences. However, it can also lead to feelings of inadequacy and unhappiness when we constantly compare ourselves to others' carefully curated highlight reels. This constant exposure to others' seemingly perfect lives can create unrealistic expectations and a sense of dissatisfaction with our own lives. Mental health issues: There has been an increasing recognition of mental health issues in recent years, and our generation has been more open about discussing and seeking help for these issues. Factors such as stress, pressure, and societal changes may contribute to higher levels of anxiety, depression, and other mental health conditions, which can impact overall happiness and well-being. Disconnect from nature and community: In an increasingly digitized world, our generation may spend more time indoors, isolated from nature and face-to-face social interactions. Lack of connection with nature and a sense of community can lead to feelings of disconnection, loneliness, and unhappiness. It's important to remember that while these factors may contribute to unhappiness for some individuals, they do not apply to everyone in our generation. Each person's experience is unique, and it's essential to consider a range of factors when discussing happiness and well-being. Additionally, societal changes and generational experiences vary across different regions and cultures, so it's important to avoid making overly broad generalizations."},{"prompt":"What are the best restaurants to try when visiting Bengaluru, Karnataka, India?

Chief selector K Srikkanth loses his cool over the recent 4–0 Test Series defeat against England on India’s tour of England. They have assembled to select the team for the next 5 ODIs and 1 T20 game. Srikkanth shouts in anger to other selectors, “Give me one name who can handle these grassy wickets”. Mohinder Amarnath stands up, walks to the writing board and writes the initials ‘R.D.’ and leaves the room. Cut to the next scene at Old Trafford Stadium for the only T20 game of the tour. Not many spectators for the match due to the poor show of India in the earlier Test series. India are at 40 for the loss of one wicket. Camera focuses on the BCCI logo of the helmet of the player that just walked in. Sweat already dripping from the edge of his helmet. A camera shot from the back showing his name ‘Dravid’ and jersey number 19. He looks down, taps his bat on the popping crease and gets ready to face the first ball. Camera zooms on his eyes that Mathew Hayden once said had more real aggression than anything else and slowly the camera zooms out as the audience sees his face for the first time, partially hidden by the helmet grill. Stuart Broad begins his run-up as the 38-year old veteran gets ready to play his first ball in his only T20 match of his career. He tries to swing the bat hard but misses the ball. Commentator Mark Nicholas - “Very unlike Rahul Dravid. Its not going to be easy for him in T20”. Graeme Swann bowls next. Having scored just 5 runs in 9 balls so far in a T20 game, Dravid comes down the track in an attempt to play in an attacking manner but misses the ball again. However, he survives as Kieswetter misses the stumping too. Nicholas - “Rahul Dravid finding it very difficult out there. 6 off 10 balls is not T20 cricket as we know”. Swann bowls another one as Dravid tries to hit higher but lands just steps away from the fielder. Nicholas - “Dravid needs to step a foot on the accelerator”. Background score intensifies proportionately as the panic on Dravid’s face. Samit Patel comes to bowl and Dravid struggles yet again and also almost runs-out Rahane. He looks at the sky and has a tiny moment of introspection. Samit Patel bowls again to him but this time Dravid comes down the track and smashes it out of the ropes for a six. Harsha Bhogle - “Well, the debutante is in a good form. Ask him to walk on water and he will ask, how many kilometers? Ask him to jump off a cliff and he will say I don’t need the parachute” Patel bowls the next ball as Dravid comes down the track once again and hits it over long-on. As the ball goes up in the sky, Wasim Akram - “Second one, maybe two in two. Yes it is” as the ball lands in the stands. Patel bowls the third ball and Dravid sweeps it over mid-wicket. Harsha Bhogle - “Is that going to be 3 in 3..?” and the scene fades while the ball continues to sail in the air as another ball falls in a local apartment building, all shown as a continuous shot. And we see a 18-year old boy pick it up who is shown as younger Rahul Dravid and the movie starts. For a career filled with doubts about his place in the team for shorter formats, Dravid’s only T20 inning for India perfectly summarizes how he proved those doubts wrong over and over again."},{"prompt":"Nuclear power plants are still just steam generators.

The difficulty resides both in basic science as well as in technology. There is a gap to bridge between the quantum “world\\" and the world of classical physics.

In nuclear fusion you get photons. So technically send each house a portion of photons? No conversion to electricity. Let computers run on light. Let's wash the dishes and cook with light. Let's get warm with light from the fusion reaction. And if the house owner wants electricity. Well convert light to electric current yourself budy. Will that work? The fusion is then a mini sun on earth. How do you efficiently transport the photons, the E=mc² stuff, from the reactor to the houses? Note the electricity network is already there.

But it is not acceptable for anyone at you table to share like when I gave my wife a taste of each, not that I ordered more than a few samples of each. I remember 3 cheeses but not how many desserts. At a better than a bistro place dinner of 4 courses will take 2+ hours. It is more social than nutritional The French eat after 8. We were able to get a walk in table until then but then the place is full. The reason they drink so much wine is to cut the fat in the food and after a heave late meal, all anyone wants for breakfast is a croissant and coffee, and in Dijon, we got it at a bar and the bartender ran to the bakery we had just walked past to get us the croissants.

Let me point out an interesting incident - She entered the cabin of her Associate Partner(AP) alongwith a colleague for an update. When they called him, he replied that he might take some time and you guys should have a seat. Seeing his Email open (laptop unlocked), they decided to pull a prank on him. They mailed the entire team saying “Due to the exceptional work done by the team in the last quarter, I would like to take you all out for lunch tomorrow.” They mailed this to EVERYONE except the partner under which they worked. Now an associate was sitting with the partner when he received the mail. He showed the partner the mail saying “Did you check Sir’s mail? This is so generous of him.” The partner who did not receive the mail was stunned! Why was he not a part of this treat? He called the Associate Partner right away for an explanation. The Associate Partner was puzzled! WHAT TREAT IS THIS GUY TALKING ABOUT? When we realized what had happened, he called the entire team to his cabin for a discussion. The plot twist comes when the Partner actually favoured the associates saying the AP should NOT have been so callous about security! (Considering they work in the FRAUD INVESIGATION department, I guess its valid). Long story short, the entire team got a free lunch the next day with the AP swearing to get back at the ‘miscreants’! Till date the team has a good laugh on this incident. How was this possible? Due to the culture set up by the Partner, the APs and the team. When I worked for PwC as a consultant for 2 months, my experience was not the same! It was more formal in nature. I could approach my seniors for anything I wanted but there were certain boundaries I would not cross! I would definitely not do what my fiancee did! That was crazy! Ofcourse the fact that my offer depended on this internship, further ensured I would not take any stupid risk! What I mean to say is that the culture differs from team to team. It depends on the time spent together working, the comfort level everyone has reached and how sporting the people are!

Bharathanatyam - it is originated from Tamil Nadu , towards south of India…it's a form where everything is stiff and perfect …. every movement is accurate and each step is perfectly portrayed … Differentiation :- it's usually stiff , fast and sculptured ….. even during each move ,the eyes hands , and legs are trained in a way it is spontaneous and to the point …. The expressions are subtle. .. not too more and not too less… Mohiniattam : it is originated from kerala again towards south of India. .. mohiniattam ( dance of enchantress) is known for its lasya….. Differentiation :- in mohiniattam , the basic posture is parted feet ( a measure is there which I can't explain through words, apologies for it) , erect upper body and gentle swaying side to side and also an 8 shape swaying ( or olachil) ….. I remember my teacher saying when we perform mohiniattam , the way we do olachil should be in a way that the audience feel that the palm trees are swaying in the wind …. Mohiniattam has elaborate but silent and soothing expressions ….. Kuchipudi: originated from Andhra Pradesh , in a village kuchipudi …. kuchipudi was initially a drama which evolved to be a classical dance form… Differentiation :- kuchipudi since it was a drama … we sing the song or the lip movement is involved in it , the expressions are little elaborate and a little over expressive and each movements involve additional movements of hips and eyes. …… However I feel kuchipudi is a mixture of mohiniattam and bharathanatyam. …. I apologise since I do not know much about other dance forms…. However, since I have seen a lot of kathak performance I would say, kathak does not have aramandalam , it has sequenced tapping of feet and clear cut and graceful hand movements. …"},{"prompt":"What should writers know?","completion":"You’re not writing, you’re story telling — writing is the medium.

A: You got a third of the way into those stories and a: were bored, and b: didn’t care about any protagonist. I say “a third” because that’s about the end of ACT I. If readers are not hooked by then, they won’t be. End of ACT I is like a mini-climax; you don’t want that to be anti-climactic. I’m not claiming to have mastered the craft, just saying there’s a lot of other people’s work that I DNFed for a variety of reasons. I’m just trying to not give readers those same reasons to DNF my work. I recommend this:1. Write the first draft as though no one will read it. As Shawn Coyne says, “Let your freak flag fly.” He means, don’t worry and just finish that sh1tty first draft getting all your high-handed editorial preaching out of your system and just FINISH. You are going to re-write (edit) your book. I can’t remember who said “Writing is re-writing.” 2. You’re a story teller, not a writer. 3. Don’t think your story will change the fact readers will get bored or will not care if your craft isn’t polished: Margaret Atwood says “Hold my attention.” Hint: we care about people, not plot - we don’t really care about the earthquake; we care about Jane and Bob trying to escape the falling building. 4. Unless your name is Stephen King, learn story structure; 3 act and 4 act are really two names for the same thing IMHO — all good tales have a mid-point high/low/reversal/reveal… some sea-change in the story.

Why?","completion":"the energy change that occurs when a neutral atom gains an electron to form a negatively charged ion. In general, the electron affinity of an element depends on its atomic structure, including its number of electrons and the arrangement of those electrons. Magnesium and helium have a stable electronic configuration with a full valence shell, which means they have a low tendency to gain an additional electron. This is because their valence shells are already complete with two and eight electrons, respectively. Therefore, they have zero electron affinity. Calcium, on the other hand, has an electronic configuration of 2,8,8,2, which means it has two valence electrons that can be gained to achieve a stable electronic configuration with a full valence shell of 2,8,8. This makes calcium more likely to gain an electron, which results in a negative electron affinity. In summary, the differences in the electronic configurations of these elements determine their tendency to gain an additional electron and therefore, their electron affinity."},{"prompt":"What is the best ayurvedic medicine for diabetes?","completion":"In addition to yoga and lifestyle modifications, Ayurveda utilizes herbal formulations to support diabetes management.

It encompasses both the content of the page and the HTML source code, all of which can be optimized for better search engine visibility. For beginners, think of on-page SEO like a detailed map that helps search engines understand the landscape of your website. The clearer and more detailed your map (on-page SEO), the easier it is for search engines like Google to navigate your site and understand its content. Now, let's dive into some practical examples and strategies: Keyword Optimization: This is one of the most critical aspects of on-page SEO. It involves integrating relevant keywords into your webpage’s title, headings, main content, URL, and meta descriptions. For instance, if you run a baking blog, you might want to optimize your articles around keywords like \\"easy homemade bread\\" or \\"chocolate chip cookies recipe.\\"Meta Descriptions: A meta description is a brief summary that appears under your page's URL in search engine results. It should accurately describe the content of your page and include your focus keyword. An engaging meta description can increase the click-through rate of your webpage.Title Tags: These are HTML elements that specify the title of a webpage. Title tags are displayed on search engine results pages and should be concise, descriptive, and include your target keyword.URL Structure: URLs should be simple, understandable, and include keywords. A well-structured URL gives both users and search engines an indication of what the destination page is about.Internal and External Links: Linking to relevant content, both within your own site (internal links) and to other trusted sites (external links), can help search engines understand the context of your content. It also enhances user experience by providing further reading options.Image Optimization: Images on your website should be optimized with appropriate file names and alt text to help search engines understand what the image is about. This is especially important for visually impaired users who rely on screen readers to browse the web.Mobile-Friendliness: With the increasing use of mobile devices for internet browsing, ensuring your site is mobile-friendly is crucial. Google uses mobile-first indexing, which means it predominantly uses the mobile version of your content for indexing and ranking.Page Speed: Fast-loading pages improve user experience and can help your site rank better. Compressing images, leveraging browser caching, and reducing redirects are just a few ways to improve page speed. For experienced users, on-page SEO isn't just about sprinkling keywords across your content. It's about creating high-quality, valuable content that serves the needs of your audience. As search engines become more sophisticated, they're better able to understand and measure the quality of content, so always prioritize value over keyword density. Remember, SEO is a long-term game. It takes time and consistent effort to see results. But with the right on-page SEO strategies, you can significantly improve your website's visibility on search engine results pages (SERPs)."},{"prompt":"What program do photographers use to edit photos?","completion":"When I searched for the best and easiest photo editors, I came across many photo editing apps available on the play store.

Gaza is a tiny place and extremely crowded. Hamas do not have the luxury of distancing their facilities from other critical facilities, or from civilians.

Has this tactic ever been used in war?","completion":"I don’t know whether it’s a war crime or not, but the punishment is usually terminal. The reason I don’t know whether it’s a was crime or not is that the perp rarely survives long enough to go to trial. When someone waves a white flag, they are surrendering. If someone then fires their weapon at you, they have completely lost all credibility. Their only recourse is to win that battle, because they won’t be believed if they wave the white flag again. Instead, they will just be terminated with extreme prejudice. They had one chance to surrender with a degree of integrity and they lost it. I’ve read accounts where this happened. One was in WW2, where one American tried to surrender, but the rest of his platoon wasn’t aware of it and fired on the approaching German soldier, killing him. Their only recourse was to win that battle, because they weren’t going to get another chance to ‘surrender’. In this case, they did win the battle, with heavy losses, the surrendering American among them. This was no small miracle that they survived this battle, since they were getting low on ammo."},{"prompt":"w did a plane crash on the upper floors of the World Trade Center result in the entire building collapsing?","completion":"The weight of a plane under several stories of tower that had multiple supports blown out, collapsed Killed 3000 investment bankers in the Greatest act of Terrorism of all time Because of physics.

Basically in such (my own country Germany included) leases only can be canceled for all involved parties). in other countries the lease runs 12 months and cannot be ended early.

To the extent the decision was made it was made in Anglo-Saxon England during the centuries before the Norman invasion. The first official government recognition of the right, the first official restriction imposed on government that I am aware of was the English Bill of Rights of 1689, 100 years before the U.S. Constitution was ratified to establish the US government. Part of the recognition that the right was important was the realization that governments are the greatest threat to human rights but the primary reason was that even the most benevolent government is not always present when individuals need protection."},{"prompt":"w make money with affiliate marketing?","completion":"Here's a step-by-step guide on how to start making money online with [LINKED_TEXT: affiliate marketing] [URL: https://bizgurukul.com/Signup?id=cbcDJ7DVHoQ&ref=VC4LmQKyLXyhg9WJlX8YPA]: Choose Your Niche:Research Affiliate Programs:Build a Platform:Create Quality Content:Promote Affiliate Products:Drive Traffic:Build an Email List:Continuously Learn and Adapt:Be Patient: Remember, success in [LINKED_TEXT: affiliate marketing] [URL: https://systeme.io/?sa=sa0105495386e0da9f21203f37a3f8b1d0a28185eb] depends on providing genuine value to your audience and [LINKED_TEXT: building strong relationships] [URL: https://onlineincomeedge.blogspot.com/].

If you believe a fetus and baby are synonyms for each other, it’s the premeditated killing of a person (No, it is not murder because it would have to be unlawful, which it isn’t).

Because we don’t know when a fetus is a person or not at, this puzzles Libertarian all over the world, and divide them. through, from my experience, they are ever so slightly more civil than the disingenuous, screeching freaks that are the pro-choicers, or the bumbling, smug, and pretentious pro-lifers. But seriously, both sides need to grow the fuck up.

What is the most exhaustive list of steps you can suggest for people to avoid car accidents?","completion":"A2A Dear Tanya! At the outset, please accept my deepest condolences! To give you a little preface, I am 41 years old and my wife is 40. Our first kid was a girl. She was a chirpy bird and we all loved her. But, as fate would have it, she died in a road accident on 24–09–2014. Even more cruel was the fact, that my father was taking her to school when the were hit by a dump truck from behind and she lost her balance, fell down and instantly got crushed under the pair of rear wheels. It was instantaneous. Now, coming to your question. I’ll try to answer it in two versions. First from the driver’s perspective and second from the pedestrian’s perspective. From the drivers point of view First and foremost, you have to be well within your limitations. Stay true to yourself. For example, your car can run effortlessly to, let’s say 150 kmph, but, you’re personally not comfortable beyond, let’s say, 85–90 kmph, then there’s no need to go beyond that. No need to get into any kind of prestige issue.Respect the machine & respect the conditions. For example, you were earlier driving a small hatchback, and now, you’ve upgraded to a more powerful sedan or an SUV. It’ll take some time before you get adujsted to it’s size, power. During the initial phase of getting used to it, just drive with your basics. Simply go back to the basics at least initially. Don’t try out anything adventurous. Add weather conditions like rain, fog etc to the mix and you have to take that into accout as well.Be situationally aware. Take a long look ahead, keep taking short and regular glances in the rearview mirrors.No distractions. Distractions on the driving seat cause accidents. If you have to take that call, please pull over and do it. If you have to very busy with your exchange of messages on whatsapp, then please park your car and spend as much time as possible. But, please, of heaven’s sake, don’t hold the phone in one hand and drive the car. I have seen countless number of people doing this and they also have the audacity to brag about it.Be mentally free. If you’re stressed out, then wait before you start the car. If you’ve had a fight, can be with anyone - your boss, your colleague, your peer, your parents etc etc, then please don’t start it immediately. Wait a couple of minutes. Take deep breaths before you start.No wrong side driving! I think this doesn’t need any clarification and should be a no-brainer! Now, from the pedestrian’s point of view. First and foremost, pay attention while you’re walkin on the road.While crossing, please follow those steps which you learnt in class 1 or 2.Again, no distractions. Please remove those headphones. Don’t look at the phone contstantly as you walk on the road. If you’re a pedestrian, trying to cross the road, then the onus of avoiding the accident is 50% yours too! Yes! Please don’t expect a vehicle to come to a sudden stop just because you’ve decided to cross the road when and where you shouldn’t!No jaywalking! Frankly, I am not interested in getting into any kind of discussion with regards to build quality of a brand compared to it’s peers. I am also not willing to get into the technical aspect and gadegtry like ABS, airbags, seat belts etc. All these things(apart from the ABS) come into the picture after the accident. Lets also not discuss about the brake systems of vehicles, like disc brakes and drum brakes! It all depends on the human factor. The human being in the driving seat and another human being trying to cross the road or simply walking along on the sidewalk. Use your common sense. With this, I would like to conclude my answer. Strength be with you and your parents in this difficult time. Regards Amit PS: Please feel free to contact me on +919810292235 for anything you or your parents may need. I shall be happy to help, if I can!"},{"prompt":"What will happen with Brexit now that Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement deal has been rejected by Parliament?","completion":"What will happen now, after the rejected Theresa May deal ?. As things stand, A “No Deal” scenario, or another, longer extension… Which will require the UK to take part in the forthcoming European Elections. Which horrifies both sides of this “Brexit” dispute. However The answer to this political “Stalemate”… May now be a lot closer to being solved. This started with the people… With an in/out referendum. It may now go back to the people to decide which of the several options available, should be acted on, to achieve what was voted for in 2016. Not a second in/out referendum, Which would be accused of being un-democratic. But a list of available options/choices to choose from. Including Theresa May’s/European solution, A full time customs union (Labour party) solution. or a no-deal solution. Or any other sensible solution, that they can think of. This system is called… Indicative voting, and the MPs in parliament, are now prepared after defeating Mrs May’s deal twice, to attempt to find a solution to the political “Stale Mate”, by voting on the original cross party motion by Hillary Benn, a former Labour cabinet minister, and Oliver Letwin, the Tory former minister whose amendment created the process. At present it applies to a non-binding politicians vote, to take place before the end of March 2019. Although the government are not bound by the resultant votes, Pressure will be applied to try to force Mrs May’s acceptance of the final vote decision. this could well be the form chosen for any “Peoples vote”, which might take place later. Eventually, weather Mrs May likes it or not, the British people will have the last say on this. Either by an “Available deal choice” (Indicative vote), or a General election. It would appear to be Mrs May’s “Final Gambit”… The higher the stakes...the bigger the risk...the harder the fall. Her political sword awaits. UPDATE…27/03/19… Eight procedures put forward in parliament… Within the indicative voting process, to decide upon the most popular alternative way, to move forward regarding how best to leave the EU were voted on. Resulting in none of them receiving a majority of votes. With the most popular of the options being Margaret Beckett’s proposal of a peoples vote. Apparently there will be a re-run of sorts, on Monday 1/4/19 (“April Fools Day”). If no alternative option can gain majority support, It leaves either Mrs May’s deal returning, to be voted on again, after failing twice previously. Or a no deal Brexit, possibly on the 12th of April ?. They have meanwhile, decided to hold another vote on Friday 29/03/19 on half of the original “Meaningful” deal. The previous two “meaningful votes” by MPs have been on the Withdrawal Agreement and the Political Declaration combined. The former is the terms of the UK’s exit from the EU, whilst the latter sets out the framework for the future trade relationship. Passing the Withdrawal Agreement alone tomorrow would allow the UK to qualify for an extension in Brexit talks to May 22 under the terms set down by the European Council last week… Friday…29/03/19… Vote taken… The government lost the vote again…344 voted to 286. So its back to indicative voting in Parliament, on Monday 01/04/19 (April Fools Day)…Second set of indicative votes held in Westminster. The Brexit paralysis gripping Britain deepened after MPs rejected all four options on the table. Proposals for a customs union, a Norway Plus-style departure and a second referendum were all defeated. Resulting in no option again receiving a majority. whilst at the same time, a group of protesters stripped off their clothes, and super glued themselves to the balcony plastic screen, (See below). In protest of climate Change….What happens next ?…Watch this space !. The latest idea of the government, is to wait until the most popular alternative process for leaving the EU has been agreed upon. Then holding a vote between that and her own option, in the belief that her deal would look good by winning the vote. She could then claim it as proof, that her deal is the only one on the table…Clever…but risky…There is still no guarantee that she would win, and if the most popular alternative was a “Peoples Vote. she might still loose. The interesting thing about these indicative votes taken, is that although none of the alternative deals received a positive majority. Two of them still received more than Mrs may’s twice failed deal. Whilst the closest to a majority was the Peoples vote idea. so if Theresa May’s deal gets backheeled for a third time, and there is every chance that it will. the “Back to the People” vote solution, looks to be the most supported of all of the options…Making it more possible for the problem to be returned to the people, to finish what they decided upon three years ago, in 2016. Meanwhile, the ERG group of 80 MPs, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, have decide to vote for Mrs May’s deal. Along with Boris Johnson (Possibly). But the ten DUP politicians, are determined to vote against it for a third time. After earlier indications that they would abstain. So it might depend upon Labour rebels, or abstainers, as to how the third vote goes…All depending of course, on weather or not, Mr Bercow, allows the vote to take place. For Theresa May, this is actually, the best chance so far of getting her Brexit deal agreed in Parliament. Especially as she has now agreed to step down, as Prime Minister, before the next stage of Brexit proceed, in return for the support of her own MPs. Plus of course her threat of choosing a General Election if they don't. PROTEST ON APRIL FOOLS DAY, IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, AS THE SECOND INDICATIVE VOTING SESSION TAKES PLACE. Protesting against lack of action taken regarding climate change. Activists from the Extinction Rebellion group… Caused a stir in the House of Commons as they stripped off while MPs debated the evening's second round of indicative votes. Some protesters from the climate change group, glued themselves to the front in the public gallery, and all left little to the imagination. Police said 12 arrests had been made for outraging public decency. Something which nobody thought they would ever see, in the House of Commons… Obviously warm enough to do, with the help of Climate Change ?. UPDATE… Her bill was knocked back again… Which sent her scrambling for a cross party agreement with Jeremy Corbyn, before the local and European elections take place in May…she didn’t make the deadline so… In the British local elections of May 2019… The Tories, led by Mrs May, had their worst showing in 24 years. Loosing 1,300 seats, and control of more than 40 town halls. With at least 39,000 voting ballot papers being spoiled, by angry voters, who had scrawled messages on them, about Brexit. Protesting about the parliamentary shambles. Next up are the European elections, with a resultant cost of approximately 150 million, for an election which nobody wants, with no end date for the candidates to serve to. The only candidates looking forward to taking part in the fiasco are Nigel Farage’s followers. UPDATE…19/05/19… The cross party discussions between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn to resolve this mess, have ended, with no agreement having been reached. Mrs May will now attempt for the fourth time to get her/European deal successfully through parliament in early June…Without the backing of Labour, it looks… “Dead in the Water”. 21/05/19… Theresa May today promised MPs a bombshell vote… On holding a second referendum in a last-ditch bid to pass her Brexit deal. She pledged a legally-binding vote will be included, in her Withdrawal Agreement Bill when it comes to the Commons, starting in the week of June 3rd. That means if MPs vote for a second referendum,the government will be Forced to legislate for it."},{"prompt":"keep working out, but I'm not seeing any progress.

I don't know the statistics on it (or if they exist) but in my experience, they have mostly, if not all been young females. A percentage have a real seizure disorder mixed with the fake or pseudo seizures. A history of abuse was common with the patients that I saw. We had a couple that clearly wanted Midazolam and/or had a benzodiazepines addiction. Most of these had no idea what a seizure should look like or watched too much bad TV. They would just jerk and flop all over the place but, if you said “hold still\\" so I can get some medications into your IV, they would hold that arm perfectly still for you. Meanwhile continuing the jerking act with the other arm and legs. As soon as medication was given, they would be awake, answering questions appropriately, etc. ** A note here to clarify about the medication we gave in the IV. It was generally not benzos/midazolam but another medication, ordered by the neurologist for these episodes. Some were ordered midazolam but, it was up to the neurologist and the judgement of us on scene as to the seizure being real or not. We would always say that we needed to get to their IV, so we could give them the medication their doctor ordered. We never said we were giving drug “A, B or C” and instead, give saline. Hopefully, other facilities don't play those games either, its unethical… ** The other type of pseudo/fake-seizure patient was basically an expert at it. They could and did fool many seasoned nurses, doctors and therapists. It was usually something very subtle that made us suspicious. Sometimes it was frequent admissions to different facilities that threw the first red flag. Some were able to withstand all types of procedures and not “break\\". I intubated one patient in particular on 3 occasions over a 2 week period due to her being so good at it, she would desaturate and be apenic for an extended period. I have had to intubate several for this. Imagine the addiction they must have to put up with intubation ( of course, I didn't just intubate without proper oxygenation and premedications. I would use etomidate or propofol for induction, per RSI protocol ) The Neurological team thinks that most of this type probably have real seizures in addition to the fake ones. Most of the patients that had mixed fake and real seizures also had suffered horrible abuse in their life (another story for another day). We would transfer this type of patient to another local hospital for 24 hour video EEG surveillance. It was not usually long before we got a report from the video EEG that would definitively answer any questions."},{"prompt":"Why don't elite soldiers and Navy SEALs have physiques like Dwayne Johnson or Vin Diesel?","completion":"Because elite soldiers like SEALs do calisthenics which is different from bodybuilding. Doing lots of push ups, pull ups, and running won’t turn you into the size of Dwayne Johnson or Vin Diesel. Calisthenics is for both physical fitness as well as testing mental toughness and resilience, which are required for special forces. The individuals who make it past BUD/s and clear Hell Week aren’t always the biggest and brawniest men. The SEAL instructors know this which is why they push everyone to see how they react when things get less than comfortable.

I mainly want to learn hip hop and Kpop dances.","completion":"Want to improve your moves? Follow these steps to learn to dance at home: 1. Select a style Start by deciding what style of dance you want to learn. There are tons out there — individual dance styles like ballet, jazz, and hip hop, and partner styles like ballroom and salsa. Definitely figure out what type you're interested in before you get started, which will make it easier to find the best resources. 2. Decide on technique or routine Next, decide whether you want to learn basic techniques or a specific dance. Most dance styles have foundational movements that trained dancers practice repeatedly to build their strength, endurance, and skill. However, some folks who are just learning for fun might prefer learning a specific dance, like Lil Uzi Vert's Shuffle rather than just practicing the basics. 3. Find the right video Now's the time to find your teacher: A video. There are tons of fantastic vids out there from professional dancers, teachers, musicians, and amateurs to help you learn to dance. Lots of websites offer classes, tutorials, or tips for burgeoning dancers — some are free and some cost money. If you're looking for a technique class, search for something like \\"hip hop dance class.\\" If you want to learn a specific dance, search for the name of the dance along with \\"tutorial,\\" like \\"Chicago Cell Block Tango tutorial.\\" 4. Warm up Before you dance, it's important you warm up. Get your heart rate up and your muscles warm by jogging in place. Do some stretching like touching your toes and opening your hips to loosen up. Most dance styles require a bit of flexibility, so focus on a few exercises that will help lengthen tight muscles before you get going. 5. Do the lesson Finally, it's time to dance! Play your video, and get moving! If you're using a smart TV, keep the remote nearby so you can pause and rewind when you need to see a step again. If you're using your phone or laptop, keep it close by for the same reason. Don't be afraid to do the same step or section a few times over — some steps take longer than others to master. Tip: Try the moves in front of a mirror next to your video so you can see how you look. 6. Practice They say it takes 10,000 hours to master a new skill — don't give up! Keep practicing with the same video and new videos with other teachers to get better at your dance. You'll see improvement the more you work at it. Where to Start Totally overwhelmed and not sure which style you should start with? Consider starting with one of the big top three: Ballet, jazz, or hip hop. Almost every other style of dance uses some ballet terminology (yes, even hip hop), so it might be helpful to learn a little ballet before anything else. Jazz and hip hop are also foundational styles — jazz is the basis for contemporary dance and hip hop informs lots of popular, urban and music video dances. Want a list of a few dance styles to try? You got it. Keep in mind, there are hundreds of different dance styles out there — one of them is absolutely perfect for you!

A proxy server is a server that acts as an intermediary between your computer and the Internet. As a result, it acts as an intermediary between your computer and any other computer on the Internet. A proxy server controls what websites your computer can access. A proxy server acts as a kind of gatekeeper. When you access a website through a proxy server, the proxy server performs all of the necessary steps the website needs. The proxy server sends your request to the website. The website's servers then respond to the proxy server, and the proxy server sends the response to your computer. Most web browsers use proxy servers by default. If you're running Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, or any other browser, you can change your default settings to use a proxy server. Proxy servers can protect your computer from viruses and hackers. But they can also slow your computer down. You can increase the speed of your computer by bypassing proxy servers. [LINKED_TEXT: Proxy servers can also be used] [URL: https://proxycrawl.com/scraping-with-worldwide-backconnect-proxy] to access websites that your computer can't normally reach. For example, many libraries use proxy servers to give students access to websites blocked at their schools. How does a proxy server work? A proxy server can also restrict access to specific websites. For example, a proxy server might provide access to pornography websites by only allowing access to certain IP addresses. A proxy server operates by intercepting all of the HTTP requests and responses submitted to and received from a website. It must therefore be able to intercept all of the same data sent by any other computer on the Internet. A proxy server stores the HTTP data it receives in an HTTP cache, which speeds up subsequent requests. A proxy server can cache data permanently, or you can store it for a limited time. Common caching times are 10, 30, and 60 minutes. Proxy servers provide privacy by protecting your computer from the website you're accessing."},{"prompt":"w long would it take the shuttle to travel to Neptune?","completion":"Forever.

What is the most exhaustive list of steps you can suggest for people to avoid car accidents?","completion":"I can empathise with your pain for losing a loved one. It is one the worst aspects of transport that is often overlooked especially in our country. India has a pathetic record when it comes to accident deaths and despite that the law makers/ enforcers and specially the citizens in majority seem completely ignorant of the fact. Not indulging more into blame-gaming, let's get into answering the question. On the face of it here are some propositions we can consider: First and foremost, education on proper driving. We should not depend on authorities to teach us, rather educate ourselves. Tip: Start with reading the Owner's Manual of the car you are driving. It contains vital information about the car and also many etiquettes which should be followed on the road.Secondly, always drive within speed limits. Speed limits are put considering the safest-highest speed at which it should be driven on that particular stretch of the road. 5–10 kmph above the speed limit is fine but keep increasing your speed and it will get more and more unsafe.Follow traffic rules. In India, because of the herd mentality people in groups can be seen violating traffic rules. Do not succumb to the temptation to follow suit and maintain your ground. Strict no-no to wrong-side driving, red light jumping, honking etc etc.Learn how to drive properly before you begin your solo journeys on the road. Use indicators every time you are taking a turn or changing lanes even though no one's around, use both the outside rear view mirrors and always check for cars behind before making a turn, drive in lane and always keep a one-car gap between you and the car ahead (sic. avoid tailgating).Avoid being instigated by errant drivers i.e., strict no to road rage.Do not touch your mobile while driving. If your work involves speaking on the phone constantly, use bluetooth headphones, not regular ear-plugs as that reduces your hearing and diverts concentration which is necessary while driving.Use low-beam after dark. Be the first one to lower your headlights or keep then that way so that you do not dazzle the vehicle coming from the opposite direction. In India people forget or have no clue about this etiquette. Even in city traffic you can find people driving on high-beam completely blinding the car ahead and the vehicles in opposite direction.Be polite on the road and understand that public roads require cooperation. Be conscious of the surroundings, for example do not block someone's free-left or park inconveniently on a narrow road etc.Be on time, leave early if you have to to avoid the worst case scenario of loss of time in traffic jams. When we are late, we tend to be aggressive, driving faster than usual and more prone to breaking rules.Do not break rules and do not take risks just to save 4–5 minutes. An age old maxim 'Better late than never' explains everything. Remember that many are late and driving hard to reach on time, which increases the chances of accidents (especially at traffic junctions) as many are doing that simultaneously.Always, always wear seat belts. The importance of seat belts cannot be undermined. Even if you are driving short distances, buckle up. Fear of challan should not be the reason to wear seat belts, safety and your life should be. Encourage others to do the same.Respect pedestrians and cyclists and give them preference while on the road. Let people cross the road, show down and be a good samaritan. Also do not honk unnecessarily, it is of no use anyway and just is an outlet of the impatience and frustration. So far I have been able to come up with these suggestions from my personal experience and the list is certainly not exhaustive. These are what I follow to stay safe on the road. Feel free to give suggestions to add anything you feel is important and is overlooked. Also if I find something new I shall put it in an edit."},{"prompt":"When will liberals realize that the reason Trump is so successful is because he represents everything liberals hate?","completion":"Easy answer: Never.

Way back in the fifteenth century, in the village of Swaffham in Norfolk, there lived a pedlar called John Chapman. Like most pedlars, he was poor, and scratched a very basic living from his work of walking from house to house, village to village, with his pack of little items to try and sell to housewives. One night, he had an extremely vivid dream, in which he heard a voice telling him that if he went and stood on London Bridge, he would hear good news. Well, he took no notice of that - it was just a dream, after all - but when he had exactly the same dream again the following night, he decided he had better do as he was told. So he and his dog set off on the very long walk to London, and finally reached it early one morning. He found his way to London Bridge, and stood there all day, waiting for the good news he had been promised, but nothing happened. Eventually, a local shopkeeper (there were shops and houses right across London Bridge in those days) could stand it no longer, and wandered over to him, to ask what he was doing, so the pedlar explained. The shopkeeper laughed. It’s just a dream, she said; if she believed in dreams, she would go to a place called Swaffham, wherever that was, and dig under an apple tree in a garden, hoping to find gold! Don’t be silly, she said, go home and get on with your life. The pedlar thanked her, and set off on the long journey home. As soon as he got there, he went straight to his back garden, and set about digging under his apple tree - and found a little pot of gold coins! There was some inscription on the jar, but he couldn’t read it. However, he encountered a passing monk some time later, and asked him what it said; the monk looked at it, and told him it said, “Under me doth lie another greater than I.” So the pedlar started digging again, once the monk had passed on his way - and sure enough, found another pot with even more money in it! He had no idea what to do with all this sudden wealth, but had the discretion not to say anything, and just kept it safe. However, not long afterwards, it was discovered that the local parish church was in a serious state of disrepair, and he volunteered to help with the cost of rebuilding, amazing the church authorities, who would never have expected a poor pedlar to be able to do such a thing. It’s just a silly folk tale, of course. But if you go to Swaffham, in Norfolk, in the parish church you will see a little wooden carving of a pedlar and his dog, and another of a woman looking over the half-doorway of a shop at him. And the church records maintained by the Rector of Swaffham from 1435 to 1474, detailing all the work done on the church during his time as Rector, itemise the rebuilding of the North Aisle of the church, paid for by one John Chapman, pedlar.

Some stress is caused by a single, short-term event, such as a disagreement with a loved one. Other types of stress occur as a result of recurring conditions, such as managing a chronic illness or a demanding job. Chronic or toxic stress occurs when recurring conditions cause stress that is both intense and sustained over a long period of time. (Image Source : Google) While all stress causes physiological reactions, chronic stress is particularly problematic due to the significant harm it can cause to the body and brain's functioning. So, What happens when you are under stress? The human body is programmed to respond to external or internal stimuli, which is known as the stress response. How do you deal with stress? While stress is not always harmful, cortisol buildup in the brain can have long-term consequences. STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN BRAIN The brain is composed of neurons and support cells known as \\"gray matter,\\" which are in charge of higher-order thinking such as decision-making and problem-solving. However, the brain also contains \\"white matter,\\" that connect to other parts of the brain to communicate information.The fatty, white sheath known as myelin speed up the electrical signals used to communicate information throughout the brain gives rise to the term \\"white matter.\\" The overproduction of myelin observed by the researchers as a result of chronic stress causes more than just a short-term shift in the balance of white and gray matter—it can also result in long-term structural changes in the brain. Doctors and researchers have previously discovered that people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder have brain abnormalities such as gray and white matter imbalances. Also in some way good stress, or stress that helps you perform well in the face of adversity, helps to wire the brain in a positive way, leading to stronger networks and greater resilience. Chronic stress, on the other hand, can cause a slew of issues. \\"Based on the patterning of white matter you get early in life, you're creating a brain that's either resilient or very vulnerable to mental disease.\\" THE BRAIN SHRINKS Even in otherwise healthy people, stress can cause shrinkage in brain areas associated with emotion regulation, metabolism, and memory. While people often associate negative outcomes with sudden, intense stress caused by life-altering events (such as a natural disaster, car accident, or the death of a loved one), the daily stress we all appear to endure can contribute to a broad range of mental diseases over time. POOR MEMORY As people age, they become more forgetful, and there is an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Under the influence of stress, the brain may shift from cognitive to survival mode, which is the cause of memory loss – more energy is directed toward survival modes than cognitive abilities. These structural changes cause differences in stress response, cognition, and memory. Stress can cause irritability, moodiness, anxiety, and depression. STRESS KILLS BRAIN CELLS A single socially stressful event may be enough to kill new neurons in the hippocampus of the brain. The hippocampus is a brain region that is strongly linked to memory, emotion, and learning. It's also one of the two areas of the brain where neurogenesis, or the formation of new brain cells, happens all the time. While stress does not appear to have an effect on the formation of new neurons, it does have an effect on whether or not those cells survive. Not only does stress affect the brain, but it also affects the body. Headaches, backaches, and knee pain are all symptoms of stress.It can put you at risk for heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes.Gynecologists have blamed stress for irregular menstrual cycles in women as well as low fertility in today's couples.It also causes the body's various systems to malfunction, including the digestive, excretory, and reproductive systems. This could account for your stomach aches, nausea, and heartburn.Worse, especially with contagious diseases like the coronavirus on the rise, stress can weaken your immune system. IN THE END…. Stress is an all-too-familiar and all-too-common part of everyday life. Every day, people experience stress in a variety of ways. It could be the stress of juggling family, work, and school commitments. It could involve issues such as health, money, or relationships. When we are confronted with a potential threat, our minds and bodies mobilize to either deal with the issue (fight) or avoid the problem (flight). There are lot of things that an individual can do to manage the stress on a daily bais but there are many other ways if its turns chronic. Plasticity, also known as neuroplasticity, refers to the ability of neural pathways in the brain to re-form. True, these pathways, such as the one between the hippocampus and the amygdala, can be severely damaged as a result of constant stress, but such changes are not always permanent. While stress can have a negative impact on the brain, both the brain and the body can recover. References McEwen BS, Bowles NP, Gray JD, et al.

A software of this class must incorporate some important functions that are required by a small business. Here are some features that should be there in your accounting software. · Basic accounting features: A small business is not as complex as a multinational or other large organization that requires a heavy accounting software costing in many lakhs. A small business should opt for an accounting software that consists of basic accounting functions like invoicing (both by email and snail mail), income and expense tracking, financial report generation, and customer management. However, if the business is in an industry that sells products, you would require a software that tracks your inventory, manages vendors, and assists you with the purchase ordering. · Timesaving automation: There are some accounting software tools that facilitate recurring invoices and past-due notifications automatically. This helps in saving time with your invoices and the accounts receivables. A business that provides the customers with quotes should look for an accounting software that converts these quotes into invoices. · Tax preparation: It is paramount that your accounting software consists of modules that assist in the process of tax preparation and other compliance related activities. It should consist of features such as automatic tax calculations, multiple tax rates and tax reporting. · Add-on services: Most of the accounting software tools provide the function of integration with third-party software. Such as payment processing and payroll services, make it easy to accept invoice payments online and pay employees. Although these services usually cost extra, they're convenient to use, and the costs may be comparable to what you'd pay elsewhere. · Third party integration: Accounting software can make it easier to run your business by integrating with the programs and services you already use, automatically sharing data between systems in real time. Popular integrations include POS systems, payment processing, advanced inventory management, e-commerce, ERP, CRM, email marketing and Google apps. These are some of the best accounting software tools available in the Indian market.

The Borg were first encountered by the Federation in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \\"Q Who?\\" and became a recurring threat throughout the franchise. Throughout the series, the Federation and its allies fought several battles against the Borg, including the Battle of Wolf 359 and the Battle of Sector 001. These conflicts resulted in significant casualties and damage to Federation ships and stations. However, over time, the Federation developed new technologies and tactics to combat the Borg, including the use of deflector shields modified to emit a specific frequency that disrupts the Borg's ability to adapt to Federation weapons. In addition, the Federation formed alliances with other species, such as the Klingons, to fight the Borg together. One of the most significant events in the defeat of the Borg was the destruction of the Borg Queen in the movie Star Trek: Nemesis. Without the Queen to coordinate their actions, the Borg were severely weakened and no longer posed a significant threat to the Federation. Overall, through a combination of advanced technologies, strategic alliances, and the elimination of the Borg Queen, the Federation was able to neutralize the Borg threat and prevent them from posing a significant danger to the galaxy"},{"prompt":"Who was the superior sniper, Chris Kyle or Carlos Hathcock?","completion":"Many people think that being a good sniper means you have the most kills. That is not the case. Being a good sniper is about field craft, and the long shot. Simo Hayek (sp), was a prolific SHARPSHOOTER, with over 500 accredited kills. However, the majority of his kills were within 100 meters of him, as such his field craft was excellent but he never made the long shot. Chris Kyle claims a “lucky” shot from over 2 km in his book. And yet, we have no PROOF that shot ever happened. There was never any hype over his shot like there was over other peoples 1.5–2k shots. Carlos Hathcock took a browning heavy barrel .50 cal machine gun, slapped a home made scope on the bastard, and using the WWI indirect fire tables was able to make a 2000 meter shot.

They are the ones who won’t disappear when you are facing problems. Which is another way of saying that a fake friend is like a shadow someone who follows you in the light and disappears in the dark.A sign of a true friend is someone who will be around even when you are no longer fun to be around. It’s also why friendship is such a key component of love and affection and a healthy relationship.Remember German philosopher Nietzsche said that what ruins most unions is not lack of love it is like friendship because what else is friendship than the willingness to be there when things are not working out? That you are the person that can be counted on to remain after everybody else is left.

Cuba abolished slavery in 1886, and Brazil abolished slavery in 1888. So perhaps in those years, 1886 to 1888. The hypocrisy of slavery in the land of the free might have festered to the point where it fell apart of its own accord, or the universal condemnation of the nations of the world might have had an impact. My guess is that there would have been some kind of indentured servitude for freed black people, working for the former slaveholder until the monetary equivalent of their worth at the time of emancipation was paid. When Northern states got rid of slavery, babies born to slave mothers after a certain date were freed, but had to serve indentures till age 18 to 25 (it varied by state). People born before that date remained slaves. In Northern states that abolished slavery, a few slaves remained for decades. It’s possibly the case that Teddy Roosevelt would have ended it by executive order; he had enough credibility to probably pull it off."},{"prompt":"What kind of experimental design is used to measure placebo effect?","completion":"What Is The Placebo Effect For people who want to cure Parkinson's naturally without hamrful drugs, you can [LINKED_TEXT: check this guide] [URL: https://cutt.ly/jF6v1Zz]. I've got great results with it. I trudged around for 40 months taking a full amount of PD drugs; i.e., Sinemet, Mirapex, Amantadine and Comtan, then Stalevo and several others from time to time. The retail value of these drugs calculated at the frequency and strength prescribed was 1,000 per month. I have followed that method and as a result, I now have a strong sense of well-being. . . It is now so difficult to express the joy which flows from feeling well after having previously asked the daily question, 'Am I ever going to have a good day again?' Before starting that method I had suffered from a general malaise and depression for about four years. I had poor posture and poor motor skills, such as cutting meat on a plate, trouble rolling over in bed. I was stone-faced with little or no expression. Basically, all that (symptoms) has abated and gone. I can smile just like the pretty girls now. I can roll over in bed. As any practicing physician worth their salt knows, whether we like it or not, since time immemorial the [LINKED_TEXT: Placebo] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo] effect and its counterpart, [LINKED_TEXT: Nocebo] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocebo], are a large component of response to medications and medical procedures. Most important aspect about the placebo effect is it exists even without a placebo, i.e., operates regardless whether the Rx is a highly specialized and well-validated drug with a known mechanism of action or a real procedure on the one hand or placebo or sham procedure on the other. In other words, ipso facto, drug effects include placebo effects. However, for too long, placebo effect research got bogged down in what placebos are, i.e., placebo pill or sham treatment content took precedence over the context in which treatments, be they real or placebo, are given. Placebo context or placebo ritual encompasses all the disparate elements of any treatment environment including beliefs, expectations, past experiences, not just the patient's but also the physician's (see below from [LINKED_TEXT: 1] [URL: http://www.thblack.com/links/RSD/Lancet2010_375_686_AdvancesOfPlaceboEffects.pdf]) and everyone else involved in it. The focus of cutting-edge placebo research is to uncover and understand the components and processes of this effect. Change in focus from placebo content to context is not only unprecedented but has the potential to truly revolutionize medicine, if it gets the attention it surely deserves like none other but which it unfortunately doesn't get, given the perennial short-sightedness of biomedicine funders, and biotech and pharma companies. And of course, the medical community also needs to get on board with what the latest in placebo effects research teaches us about how medicines actually work, as in how much a person's psychological response to being treated plays a major role in a treatment's effectiveness. How To Study Placebo Effects [LINKED_TEXT: Randomized controlled trial] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial] (RCT) which are also [LINKED_TEXT: Placebo-controlled study] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study] don't help understand the placebo effect since that isn't really their focus. Rather they merely seek to account for the placebo fait accompli in order to more accurately assess the 'real' treatment's effect. As well, many of them don't include the key no treatment group necessary to assess the magnitude of the placebo effect separately. However, comparing placebo and no treatment groups doesn't fully reveal the entirety of placebo effects either. An early placebo effects RCT (2) found the cholecystokinin antagonist [LINKED_TEXT: Proglumide] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proglumide] to be more effective against post-operative pain compared to placebo. So far so good. However, this study, done by the groundbreaking placebo researcher, [LINKED_TEXT: Fabrizio Benedetti] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabrizio_Benedetti], included a further group, those who got proglumide but weren't told about it, i.e., a hidden treatment group. Such patients reported no alleviation of their pain, even though they'd received the same dose of painkiller! How to explain this? When given openly, proglumide presumably interacts with and enhances expectation pathways, i.e., one type of placebo effect. In other words, proglumide doesn't act on pain pathways itself and thus is only effective when combined with psychosocial mechanisms operating during physician-patient interactions. A Representative Example Of Experiments That Uncover & Study Placebo Effects Separately From Placebo A pioneering placebo effect study by the groundbreaking placebo researcher, [LINKED_TEXT: Ted Kaptchuk] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kaptchuk], in this RCT on 262 [LINKED_TEXT: Irritable bowel syndrome] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome] (IBS) patients, placebo effects were separated into their 2 main components or combined together and compared to no treatment ([LINKED_TEXT: 3] [URL: http://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/336/7651/999.full.pdf]). Placebo ritual alone: a validated placebo acupuncture device which retracts into the needle handle instead of penetrating the skin.Placebo ritual plus patient-clinician relationship. The latter consisted of a prospectively scripted process that entailed attention, warmth, confidence and thoughtful silence. 3 weeks into the trial, using a validated measure for IBS, patients reporting improvement were 28% in the no treatment group.44% in the placebo ritual group alone.62% in the placebo ritual plus patient-clinician relationship. The 62% improvement seen in the placebo ritual plus patient-clinician relationship was similar to that seen in an earlier RCT where patients were treated with [LINKED_TEXT: Alosetron] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alosetron], a drug used for IBS Rx ([LINKED_TEXT: 4] [URL: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Camilleri7/publication/12572423_Camilleri_M_Northcutt_AR_Kong_S_et_al._Efficacy_and_safety_of_alosetron_in_women_with_irritable_bowel_syndrome_A_randomized_placebo-controlled_trial._Lancet_20003551035-1040/links/55a4ec1508ae00cf99c932af.pdf]). In other words, this study's placebo effects were just as effective as active IBS Rx was reported to have been in a previous study. What kind of experimental design helps uncover, maybe even quantify, placebo effects, which operate regardless of real medication or placebo? The Open-Hidden Study Design. First, to consider that any medical treatment has specific and non-specific effects. The latter could ensue simply from knowledge that a treatment's being given, i.e., expectation.Second, assess the treatment's effectiveness byEliminating its specific effect, i.e., a placebo study: No active Rx, only placebo.Eliminating non-specific effects, i.e., hidden treatment: Active Rx but patient doesn't know. Called the Open-Hidden Study Design (see below from [LINKED_TEXT: 5] [URL: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Luana_Colloca/publication/8229264_Overt_versus_covert_treatment_for_pain_anxiety_and_Parkinson%27s_disease/links/542bfc650cf27e39fa91c712.pdf]), this experiment design has thus far best elucidated magnitude and duration of placebo effects, and uncovered their two main drivers, expectations and classic conditioning, i.e., learning. Open-Hidden Study Design Reveals Placebo Effects Can Ensue From Expectations Of Symptom Improvement Consider a physician-administered drug. In open treatment, the physician injects the drug into the patient openly with normal verbal and contextual interactions, i.e., complete representation of routine physician-patient psychosocial interaction.In hidden treatment, patient gets the drug infused via a computer pump in the absence of a physician and the therapeutic context. Hidden treatment patients only know they're supposed to get a drug injection at some point, not when. Thus they don't experience the expectation component and other contextual factors associated with their treatment. With such a design the placebo component is defined as the difference between open and hidden treatments, even though no placebo is given ([LINKED_TEXT: 5] [URL: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Luana_Colloca/publication/8229264_Overt_versus_covert_treatment_for_pain_anxiety_and_Parkinson%27s_disease/links/542bfc650cf27e39fa91c712.pdf], 6). Several open-hidden studies on painkillers such as [LINKED_TEXT: Buprenorphine] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buprenorphine], [LINKED_TEXT: Ketorolac] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketorolac], [LINKED_TEXT: Metamizole] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamizole], [LINKED_TEXT: Morphine] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphine], [LINKED_TEXT: Tramadol] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tramadol] found hidden treatment markedly less effective compared to open treatment. One study had open versus hidden pain treatment groups among both healthy and post-operative patients ([LINKED_TEXT: 7] [URL: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Martina_Amanzio/publication/12124633_Response_Variability_to_Analgesics_A_Role_for_Non-Specific_Activation_of_Endogenous_Opiods/links/09e41505b1605c85e3000000.pdf]).Healthy volunteers (n=86) subjected to experimental ischemic arm pain (combination of venous blood draw and [LINKED_TEXT: Esmarch bandage] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmarch_bandage]): Hidden treatment group had higher pain ratings.Post-thoracic surgery patients (n=278) with post-operative pain: Hidden treatment group needed much higher doses of pain medication to reduce pain by 50%. One study examined effect of open versus hidden treatment with morphine among 42 patients with post-operative pain, open versus hidden treatment with [LINKED_TEXT: Diazepam] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazepam] among 30 thoracotomized patients with anxiety, and open versus hidden stimulations of the subthalamic nucleus in 10 Parkinson's patients (8).In all these cases, pain medications were much less effective in the hidden treatment groups.In all these cases, the open treatment condition differed from the hidden one in three important parameters, namely, patient was aware of the treatment, the therapist was present in the room and thus patient had an expectation of the outcome. Studies on painful rectal distention balloon in IBS patients given local anesthetic or placebo found subtle manipulation of expectations directly influenced placebo response magnitude. In one study (9), patients were told they 'may receive an active or placebo agent’.In the other study ([LINKED_TEXT: 10] [URL: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.474.4595&rep=rep1&type=pdf]), they were told 'the agent you have been given is known to significantly reduce pain in some patients’.The second study with the more specific instructions elicited stronger placebo responses. Implication: Better defined, more specific instructions may improve treatment response. One study ([LINKED_TEXT: 11] [URL: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Martina_Amanzio/publication/11934203_Response_expectancies_in_placebo_analgesia_and_their_clinical_relevance/links/0912f505b1444f1bab000000.pdf]) assessed post-operative pain alleviation. Intravenous (iv) saline was the placebo, buprenorphine on request the standard analgesic Rx. Patients were divided into three groups Group One was told iv saline was a rehydrating solution.Group Two that it was a powerful painkiller.Group Three that it may or may not be a powerful painkiller.Group Two took 33% less buprenorphine compared to Group One.Group Three took 20% less buprenorphine compared to Group One. Implication: Active Rx plus placebo effects could reduce total analgesic usage. Open-Hidden Study Design Reveals Placebo Effects Can Ensue From Learning To Expect Symptom Improvement, i.e., Pre-Conditioning For long, the assumption prevailed that in order to work, placebos required deception or concealment. Pioneering placebo effects studies show this isn't so, that they entail learning processes that allow placebos to work in reducing symptoms even with patients knowing about them. In one study ([LINKED_TEXT: 12] [URL: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Luana_Colloca/publication/7079500_How_prior_experience_shapes_placebo_analgesia/links/0deec5204375cbc27c000000.pdf]), 30 healthy right-handed volunteers were given pain stimulus (electric shock) to their non-dominant hand. At the same time, placebo effect was introduced by surreptitiously reducing pain stimulus to make volunteers believe an analgesic Rx was effective. This subterfuge yielded real 3 to 5-fold pain reductions that lasted as long as 4 to 7 days later, as assessed by repeat experiments when patients knew they were getting placebo, not drug.In one study ([LINKED_TEXT: 13] [URL: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4424173/pdf/nihms675070.pdf]), 54 adult female volunteers were told the study compared analgesia from a topical cream compared to placebo. Patients were randomly assigned to long (4 days) or short (1 day) pre-conditioning, i.e., surreptitious Rx with placebo cream. Placebo effect, i.e., perceived analgesia relief, persisted in the long pre-conditioning group even when they were later openly treated with placebo. Implication: Reinforcing treatment cues with positive outcomes can create placebo effects independent of expectations, i.e., placebo effects can also be learned. In a study [LINKED_TEXT: (14] [URL: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Martina_Amanzio/publication/13417422_Amanzio_M_Benedetti_F_Neuropharmacological_dissection_of_placebo_analgesia_expectation-activated_opioid_systems_versus_conditioning-activated_specific_subsystems_J_Neurosci_19_484-94/links/0912f505b177c89d12000000.pdf]) by Benedetti's group, 229 adult volunteers were subjected to experimental ischemic arm pain (combination of venous blood draw and [LINKED_TEXT: Esmarch bandage] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmarch_bandage]), and conditioned with either opioid morphine or non-opioid [LINKED_TEXT: Ketorolac] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketorolac]. Placebo effect associated with morphine but not by ketorolac could be reversed by [LINKED_TEXT: Naloxone] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naloxone]. Benedetti interprets this data to suggest that morphine related placebo effect involves [LINKED_TEXT: Endorphins] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorphins] while ketorolac involves [LINKED_TEXT: Cannabinoid] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid#Endocannabinoids] ([LINKED_TEXT: 15] [URL: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v535/n7611_supp/pdf/535S14a.pdf]). Implications: Placebo effects associated with different drugs tap different neurochemical pathways. Implications Of Placebo-Associated Learning Effects: Placebos As Drugs Have Potential To Reduce Drug Costs, Dependency, Dose, Side-effects, Tolerance In a pioneering randomized, two group, open-label placebo study ([LINKED_TEXT: 16] [URL: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/asset?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0015591.PDF]) on 80 IBS patients, Kaptchuk et al openly gave sugar pills to one of the groups as 'placebo pills made of an inert substance, like sugar pills, that have been shown in clinical studies to produce significant improvement in IBS symptoms through mind-body self-healing processes'. Both groups involved similar patient-provider interactions, the only difference between them being that one got sugar pills. Those who took sugar pills (22/37, 59%) reported significantly higher improvement in symptom relief compared to the no treatment group (15/43, 35%).In a 2016 study on 42 Parkinson's disease patients ([LINKED_TEXT: 17] [URL: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/JP271322/epdf]), Benedetti et al showed that timing of pre-conditioning with placebo during treatment with apomorphine couldProduce both clinical and neuronal responses.Convert even placebo non-responders to responders.Clearest sign that active learning was involved was evident in the fact that greater the number of prior exposures to apomorphine, greater magnitude and longer duration of clinical and neuronal placebo responses. A 2016 review (18) of 22 placebo effects studies on conditions as varied as [LINKED_TEXT: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder] (ADHD), experimental immunosuppression, insomnia and pain concluded placebos have the potential to be used openly to reduce drug costs, dependency, dose, side-effects and tolerance. Such usage could be especially propitious and timely in the case of opioid use whose per capita use in US is double that in the UK, 3X that in the Netherlands and 26X that in Japan (18), stoking an unprecedented public health crisis that even appears to have truncated life expectencies among white, non-Hispanic Americans ([LINKED_TEXT: 19] [URL: http://www.pnas.org/content/112/49/15078.full.pdf?sid=e8f2068d-be81-4b62-83fe-090cb44934c5]).

If not, what would be some reasons why this could happen?","completion":"That’s a good question. A major task when doing diagnosis is what’s called “Differential Diagnosis” and I will explain. Many diagnoses are very similar but they typically have different causes. So, if you make a mistake and think the person has Condition A but it’s really B, you will be sending the person on the wrong path of treatment. Example, personality disorders tend to be developed from child abuse, weird environmental conditions, and so on. Thus, personality disorders are entirely psychological which means how your belief system was programmed. Meanwhile, something like Schizophrenia can be related to very high stress and mental abuse but it can also be caused by something wrong with your brain. So, people with that problem likely need medication rather than just talk therapy. So, Bipolar Disorder can be psychological in nature, trauma related, but it’s currently thought it might be a brain issue. Borderline Personality Disorder is child abuse related and features mood swings, like Bipolar, and a psychotic thought process featuring anxiety fugues, paranoid thoughts, criminal behavior, and more. Schizophrenia can be trauma related but it is seen as being due to brain damage and these people can have bizarre ideas and moods related to their ideas. The question is, how can you tell the difference between these problems? The best way is to get to know the patient and their story. A person with Borderline Personality Disorder is going to have the story of a Borderline. A therapist ought to know what this is. It’s typically a pattern of mental, physical, and/or sexual abuse at the hands of some important person like a parent. Super high stress from abuse is associated with Bipolar and Schizophrenia. However, many patients don’t even know this and are unlikely to tell you. Rather, they just have the symptoms without having stories about what causes them. So, unraveling the life stories of the patient is very important to figuring out what is going on and putting the patient on the right direction to help. I have noticed that uneducated clinicians, which are typically psychiatrists, tend to diagnose Borderlines as Bipolar cases. That then ignores the abuse the Borderline experienced and the doctor puts them on toxic medication that doesn’t work for Borderline Personality Disorder. So, this person now thinks they have a “chemical imbalance” when in reality they have a trauma and abuse background. The misdiagnosis then caused the patient to invalidate the abuse they experience and blame themselves for their mental problems. That then opens their abusive family to call them “crazy” or “defective” and abuse them further. That’s some bad stuff that can happen if you aren’t exact about what you are doing. Could a Person Have All of the These at Once: Bipolar and Schizophrenia are kind of nonsense terms. No one knows what causes these issues. However, we do know they relate to abuse, which is little known publically. So, maybe Bipolar and Schizophrenia are real or just versions of the same thing. However, we do have pretty solid ideas about what causes Borderline Personality Disorder. Could a person abused into developing BPD also have brain damage thus resulting in Schizophrenia/Bipolar? Sure. That is IF Bipolar and Schizophrenia are in fact the result of brain damage. If both are trauma related forms of mood swings and psychotic thought development, then one can only have one of those diagnoses at a time."},{"prompt":"Does evaporation increase viscosity?","completion":"Evaporation of one material (as a solvent) from a liquid can increase the viscosity of that remains behind.

He looked dull when compared to a bright and breezy David Camereon. Plus the financial crash didn’t help matters, nor did the debt the Labour Government had left the country in. 2015: Ed Milliband was Party Leader and left leaning. Made the centre ground floating voters uncomfortable and his stupid ‘Ed Stone’ was just asking for ridicule. SNP had a surge in Scotland and the Tories promised a referendum on the EU… something that Labour had promised previously and welched on. 2017: Corbyn to left leaning and entirely wishywashy on his Brexit stance. People didn’t trust Corbyn and wanted Brexit to happen. Mobilized the student vote by promising free University and wiping the slate clean on Student loans (and then backing out of the Student loan promise). 2019: Corbyn trots out ‘I’ll be neutral on Brexit’ line that nobody with half a brain cell believed as he’s been Anti-EU since he’s become an MP. Unpopular with the majority of voters as a person, let alone because of his political leanings. Promised a farcical program of nationalization and re-nationalization that would have cost the earth and put the entire country over a barrel when it came to paying for these utilities (no competition = they can charge you whatever they want). The promise of free broadband made no literal sense and left a lot of people scratching their heads (and the smarter people feeling very uncomfortable at what state owned broadband means for data protection). Also the assumption that the Nortern Wall would vote Labour despite Labour being the Remain Party, the fact the Nortern consistencies were heavily in favour (and still are) of Leaving the EU and having suffered years of having Labour MPs forced upon them who probably stuggled to point out their consitnency on a Map after becoming MP, let alone before being elected as MP. Telling, that he failed to truly mobilize the student vote this time around. And its not because of when the election was called - there was nothing stopping those students registering for a postal vote. Or a proxy vote."},{"prompt":"What's the next number in the series: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11?","completion":"But I really like Richard Morris’s answer about numbers which do not contain the letter “t” when written out in English."},{"prompt":"German Shepherd owners, why did you choose a German Shepherd over other breeds?","completion":"For me it was because that was the first dog my family ever owned. We just moved to a new state and a new house when I was 5 yo. A few months later my father’s cousin showed up with a puppy he supposedly found in the woods. He was a GSD/Husky mix but grew up with me. He passed at 14yo. From there I was always attracted to Shepherds.

But U of T today probably has a lot more available for new students than they did when I was involved."},{"prompt":"What is it like to have a good/best friend of the opposite gender?","completion":"It sometimes has its perks. When they are looking away, you get to stare at their chest or their crotch, which isn't as pleasant to do with your male friends. Otherwise, they aren't all that much different than having a sister. They don't give you any valuable dating tips, and they keep secrets just like women you may not be close with. What I do like about my female friends is that they will let me know when other woman are checking me out, and being surrounded by female friends does make me seem more friendly. However, female friends also intimidate other women who may be interested in me, so I am approached a lot less when I hang out with women. So I end up having to do all the leg work."},{"prompt":"What is the most misunderstood picture that has become famous (or infamous)?","completion":"Image source : Wikipedia This photograph was taken by a photographer Arthur Sasse on March 14, 1951 when Albert Einstein was leaving a celebration held in Princeton, New Jersey for his 72nd birthday. Sasse was trying to get a photo of the Nobel prize winning physicist smiling but instead he stuck out his tongue while sitting at the back of the car. Einstein liked it so much that he had some prints taken out for himself and he died four years after the picture was taken. In 2009, an original print signed by Albert Einstein sold at an auction for 74000. According to the history channel, in 1953, in the midst of Sen. Joseph McCarthy’s anti-communist crusade, Einstein had given the print to outspoken journalist Howard K. Smith, with the inscription (translated from German): “This gesture you will like, because it is aimed at all of humanity. A civilian can afford to do what no diplomat would dare. Your loyal and grateful listener, A. Einstein.” So the historians believe that the photo and its inscription represent his spirit of non-conformity against McCarthyism. So it is not Einstein’s goofy nature in the picture that made it famous, it was his spirit of non-conformity. This is the actual photo : Image source : [LINKED_TEXT: http://Allthingsinteresting.com] [URL: http://allthingsinteresting.com/] Content Source : History channel"},{"prompt":"What is a dofollow backlink?","completion":"Dofollow backlinks and nofollow backlinks are two different ways of recognizing a link and advising Google how to relate the website you are linking to your website.

First let me qualify my answer by saying I’m nowhere near the level of those who make these decisions. But I do see and hear what goes on around me. Its about the money because it’s ALWAYS about the money. The higher the show’s rating the more ABC can charge a sponsor to air a commercial. But it’s not quite that simple. ABC/Disney likes to “own” the shows that air. That means we like shows done in house like Good Morning America and The View. It’s more expensive to pay someone on the outside to produce a show for us, so that’s a consideration as well. I won’t mention her name, but perhaps 10 yrs ago there was an actress in a failing show of ours. For some reason they thought she had potential so they gave her a starring role in a new show that replaced another very well liked show with very good ratings. Her new show soon failed also and we lost a winner in the process. Sometimes you have to disregard the initial ratings and go with your gut. ”Monk” was a prime example. It originally aired on ABC briefly and was dropped yet it became a hit on another network that had a little more patience. So yes it’s all about the ratings, but it’s like playing the stock market. You have to pick what you think will become a winner even if the ratings start out low."},{"prompt":"Why did Will Smith slap his costar at the Oscars?","completion":"I assume you mean as opposed to punching him? My opinion is, he thought a slap would be more “gentlemanly’."},{"prompt":"What kind of experimental design is used to measure placebo effect?","completion":"The measurement of the placebo effect in experimental studies typically involves the use of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design. RCTs are considered the gold standard for studying the efficacy of medical interventions, including the assessment of the placebo effect. Let's delve into the components and considerations of experimental design when measuring the placebo effect: Randomization: Participants in the study are randomly assigned to different groups. This helps ensure that any observed effects can be attributed to the treatment being studied rather than other factors, such as individual differences between participants. Randomization helps create groups that are similar on average, minimizing bias and confounding variables.Control group: An essential component is the inclusion of a control group. This group receives a placebo treatment or no treatment at all, providing a baseline against which the treatment group can be compared. The purpose of the control group is to isolate and measure the specific effects of the placebo.Treatment group: This group receives the active intervention being studied. In the context of studying the placebo effect, the treatment group usually receives a placebo treatment, such as a sugar pill or a sham medical procedure. The participants in this group may believe they are receiving a genuine treatment, and the placebo effect refers to any observed improvement or change in their condition that cannot be attributed to the active components of the treatment.Blinding: To minimize bias, blinding is implemented. Single-blind studies involve participants being unaware of whether they are receiving the treatment or the placebo. Double-blind studies extend this to also include the experimenters and researchers involved in the study, ensuring that their expectations or behavior do not influence the results. Blinding helps reduce the impact of psychological factors and increases the validity of the results.Outcome measures: The placebo effect can be measured using various outcome measures, depending on the specific condition being studied. These measures can include subjective self-report assessments (e.g., pain scales, symptom questionnaires) and objective measurements (e.g., physiological markers, laboratory tests). By comparing the outcomes of the treatment and control groups, researchers can assess the magnitude of the placebo effect.Sample size: Adequate sample size is crucial to obtain reliable and statistically significant results. It ensures that any observed effects are not due to chance. Power analysis is conducted to determine the required sample size based on factors like the expected effect size, desired statistical power, and significance level.Ethical considerations: When conducting placebo-controlled studies, it is important to consider ethical guidelines. Participants must provide informed consent, be fully aware of the potential risks and benefits, and be informed that they may receive a placebo treatment. Ethical concerns arise when studying conditions where effective treatments already exist, as it may be considered unethical to withhold a proven treatment from participants in the control group. By employing a well-designed randomized controlled trial, researchers can assess the magnitude of the placebo effect and determine whether the observed improvement in the placebo group is statistically significant and clinically meaningful. This experimental design allows for rigorous evaluation and understanding of the placebo effect's impact in various medical and psychological contexts.

BBQ is cooking something low and slow over wood or charcoal for hours on end until it’s done. There are places that serve genuine American BBQ but they’re rare.

However, it is important to note that spot reduction is not possible, and targeted weight loss is not always achievable. In other words, losing face fat in two months will require an overall weight loss plan that incorporates healthy diet and lifestyle changes. Here are some tips that can help you achieve your goal: 1. Create a calorie deficit: The key to losing weight is creating a calorie deficit by burning more calories than you consume. To lose face fat, you need to lose weight overall. It is recommended to aim for a safe and sustainable weight loss of 1-2 pounds per week. This can be achieved by creating a calorie deficit of 500-1000 calories per day through a combination of diet and exercise. 2. Eat a healthy diet: Focus on consuming whole, nutrient-dense foods that are low in calories but high in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Avoid processed and high-fat foods, sugary drinks, and excessive salt intake, which can lead to water retention and bloating. Incorporate more fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats into your diet. 3. Exercise regularly: Incorporate cardiovascular and strength-training exercises into your routine to burn calories and tone your facial muscles. Cardiovascular exercises such as running, cycling, or swimming can help you burn calories, while strength-training exercises such as push-ups, squats, and lunges can help you tone your facial muscles. 4. Practice facial exercises: Facial exercises can help tone and strengthen the muscles in your face, which can contribute to a more defined jawline and cheekbones. Examples of facial exercises include cheek lifts, jawline exercises, and lip presses. However, it is important to note that the effectiveness of facial exercises is still debated, and results may vary. 5. Stay hydrated: Drinking plenty of water can help flush out toxins from your body, reduce water retention, and keep your skin looking healthy and hydrated. Aim to drink at least eight glasses of water per day. 6. Reduce alcohol and smoking: Alcohol and smoking can contribute to water retention and puffiness in your face. Limit your alcohol intake and quit smoking to improve your overall health and reduce facial bloating. 7. Get enough sleep: Getting enough sleep is essential for weight loss, as lack of sleep can increase your hunger hormones and slow down your metabolism. Aim for at least 7-8 hours of sleep per night to support your weight loss goals. In conclusion, losing face fat in two months will require an overall weight loss plan that incorporates healthy diet and lifestyle changes. Remember that spot reduction is not possible, and targeted weight loss is not always achievable. Be patient, consistent, and committed to your weight loss journey, and celebrate your small successes along the way."},{"prompt":"Why is the researcher the instrument in qualitative research?","completion":"Because the researcher must determine if the data is what is needed or different questions need to be asked.

Why is turning a profit on ownership not a good thing?","completion":"What is rent seeking? This is a collision of English words. Because most people know “rent” as what they pay for their apartment each month. But, in classical economics, “rent” means the return on a factor of production above the amount needed to keep it in “current use”. What does that mean? Suppose, I have a small plot of land—and it need not be land, it could be machinery or money or anything of value. I let my neighbor allow his cows to graze there. He pays me, say, 60 per month. Any amount less than that, and I don’t want to deal with this grazing issue. This is a low-value use of my property. But, that is in fact the current use of the property. But suppose another neighbor wants to let his chickens graze there. Because pasture-raised eggs are so hot right now. And, he’s willing to pay me 100 per month. Well, as compared to the previous person, I would be willing to keep the land for use as grazing for 60. But the chicken-farmer is willing to pay a 40 premium above current use. This 40 is rent. Sometimes, people will say “economic rent” to be clear. Because the farmer’s rent paid is 100, and the rent I receive is 100. But the economic rent is 40. The distinction here is especially obvious in land cases, because (generally and abstractly) there is no expense to the simple uses of land. ALL monies received are profit. Of course, in the real world, this is completely wrong—buying, improving, and maintaining land can be quite expensive. But in economics, we try to begin with a simple model, before we add on the complications. In terms of economic rent, it should be no surprise that owners try to find people who will pay more for something than the minimum price he would accept to keep the asset in “current use”. A property owner may often want to maximize his economic rents. But, in reality, a property owner often wants to maximize his profits. But profits are not economics rents. Why is turning a profit on ownership not a good thing? It can be. But it’s not inherently good or bad. (Answering that fuzzy question is quite hard in practice.) The term “rent seeking behavior” became more prominent after criticism that certain people—very wealthy people—were continually trying to use government laws and regulations to stifle innovation and competition, so that people would be squeezed into paying higher premiums for goods and services. Because the law encouraged that. They were intentionally trying to change the playing field to extract higher economic rents from consumers. Their behavior was “rent-seeking”. In terms of public discourse, it is a little tragic that the focus was on the profitability, and not the actual process by which they tried to obtain that profit. For example, pharmaceutical companies in the United States are very accurately described as “rent seeking”. But, this causes confusion—too many people immediately assume that this profit motive is, therefore, bad. Of course not. We should want drug companies to earn a modest and healthy profit for the value they deliver to consumers What we should not want drug companies to do, is manipulate the political process to safeguard their profits from competition. So that they can charge high prices for old, off-patent drugs which are cheap to manufacture. So that they don’t have to worry about providing high value to consumers. And we don’t have a really good, commonly used phrase for that. One that quite describes what they’re doing, that most people instantly understand. Or if there is, I don’t know it. Like my stuff?

Let’s start with Gyokko’s blood demon art first. It involves vases and aquatic things. He could spawn his vases anywhere he want, and can transport easily from vase to vase. He could also fit anything inside his vases, and could control anything inside his vases. This is pretty hard to explain, but let’s just say it works the same as Trafalgar Law’s “Room” from One Piece. This is one of his “masterpiece” created inside his vase. Other than that, he could summons some aquatic things from his vases like fishes; octopus; also water bubble or something like that. Pretty strange right? Well, anyway let’s move on to love breathing, a breathing style created and can only be used by Mitsuri Kanroji. She created love breathing from the flame breathing taught to her by the flame hashira himself, Rengoku Kyojuro. This strange breathing style can only be used with a strange whip-like nichirin.. ..and can only be used by Mitsuri with her abnormal muscles condition.

In the chapter where he addresses the conceptual metaphors underlying causation, Lakoff references a comment that Bertrand Russel made in his own book, The Principles of Mathematics, where he said, “force is a mathematical fiction, not a physical entity”. Some physicists might want to protest at this point, but if so it is only because they are making some naive assumptions about their own experiences. In any event, this fiction is expressed in Newtonian mechanics by the simple expression, F=ma. Now, for the case of the force of gravity Einstein took even this fact to a new level of abstraction by providing a mathematical model that explains gravity in terms of the warping of four dimensional space-time. The mathematical expressions of which are quite a bit more complicated than they were in Newtonian Mechanics. In a nutshell, then, String Theory, following the example provided by Einstein with General Relativity, simply attempts to explain all the “forces” of nature by suggesting that they are the result of the warping of space in additional regions than the three we experience, and it does this by yet still more complicated mathematical expressions. What is great about Lakoff’s explanation is that it exists as a meta-explanation since the mathematics that underpin such physical models is also predicated upon implicit metaphors. At any rate, there is a widely believed falsity that somebody who understand the mathematics understands the theory better. This is true only in a very limited—if albeit very important—sense. These physicists will be able use the mathematics to make predictions (eventually it is hoped) in a way that is not possible for someone who only understands the thing analogously through other types of conceptual metaphors, i.e other than through mathematics. The fact is we are all challenged by what it might mean for “tiny strings” made of no-thing to “vibrate” in a multidimensional space, most of which are beyond our ability to even imagine because they are curled up so tight we don’t experience them. Just like we are all challenged to understand so-called wavicles or cats that might be both alive and dead at the same time, or an infinite number of parallel universes where you exist after having made different life choices (as a combined 60% of surveyed physicists subscribe to either the Copenhagen Interpretation or the Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics). What someone who really understands the mathematics of String Theory, which is actually no one at present (that’s part of the problem) will likely still struggle with imagining what the mathematics is expressing—or maybe not. There is a story that Richard Feynman was once challenged by another physicist to explain in a straightforward way why half spin particles obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. Feynman came back a few days later and said he couldn’t reduce it to a “freshman” level of explanation, stating additionally “that means we don’t really understand it.” So, again, the reason there really is no good resource for understanding String Theory in layman’s terms is because no one really understands String Theory yet. What those who can do the math “understand” is how to manipulate the math to find new mathematical relationships. Some physicists who aren’t very philosophically literate may confuse this with actually understanding the phenomena the math describes, but I am with Feynman on the fact that if they really did then they would be able to explain it to you in straightforward manner. Also, if no one else has already suggested it you might try [LINKED_TEXT: The Official String Theory] [URL: http://superstringtheory.com/] website."},{"prompt":"What is dropshipping? Is it really profitable?","completion":"Dropshipping refers to the order fulfillment strategy wherein the retailers do not need to keep their products in inventory. Instead, they will rely on the manufacturers or retailers to ship the order to the customers. As the customers place their orders for the dropshipped products, the retailers will receive the orders and the payment for the orders. Then, they will manually or automatically contact the manufacturer and wholesaler, issue the purchase order for the particular item and provide the shipping instructions directly to the customers. Here, the manufacturer or wholesaler will ship the product, and the retailer will earn the profit. See the advantage? What makes dropshipping attractive for many ecommerce entrepreneurs or young business enthusiasts? It is the low entry barrier as well as the zero need for the physical inventory. In dropshipping, the suppliers will send the orders directly to the customers generated by the middlemen. In other words, customers will be the one who gives and pay you the money to shop for them. Is it really profitable? Yes. But in order to achieve good results, you need to make some effort (as in any other business). currently, it is much easier to start a business - there are optimized solutions, plugins, guides, services that will help to increase the speed of work.

Forensic science is the application of scientific knowledge and methodology to criminal investigations and legal problems. Forensic Science is a multidisciplinary subject, it encompasses various fields of science such as chemistry, biology, physics, geology, psychology, social science, engineering, etc. Due to increase in crime rate and criminals, the scope of Forensic Science is increased exponentially. There are lots of job opportunities in the field of Forensic Science. The need of forensic scientists is huge all around the world, especially in India. Some of the forensic scientists visit the crime scene to collect the evidence themselves and another one work in a forensic laboratory to perform analysis on objects. In the forensic laboratory, they testify as expert observers in both criminal and civil cases and can work for either the defense or the prosecution. Forensic scientists can be employed in the government sector. They work in different law enforcement agencies and investigation departments such as police, investigative services of state and central government and legal system. Some of the private agencies also employed those candidates who have some qualification in this field. A trained forensic scientist may hire by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) & Intelligence Bureau (IB). You can also work as a freelancer as forensic scientists specializing in one segment & can be paid much. You can also work as a legal counselor after gaining experience as a Forensic Scientist. Teaching is another interesting career for forensic scientists. You can work in the institutions that impart education in forensic Science. Candidates have a degree, they can explore the career in forensic science in the USA and other developed countries.

In the end, the “supporters of Genghis Khan” won, but the big shock was that the conquerors took up arms and began to kill them.

It's allowed but it isn't compulsory. If you don't want to marry your gay boyfriend you don't have to. If two gay people want to get spliced it's their decision, it's not my decision or yours, it's theirs. It doesn't affect you or me in any way so way could you possibly get upset by it? That's what living in a free country is all about. We also have freedom from gun violence. The people required government to ensure their safety from idiots with guns. Again, we are a free country, free from the fear of mass shootings, free from the necessity of teaching our kids active shooter drills , freedom from mass funerals of school children. Women here are free from other people's bigotry. If you don't agree with the ethics of abortion guess what? You don't have to have one. If you have a uterus it's yours to decide, not some old man sitting on the porch of his shack drinking moonshine and spitting tobacco juice into the dust as he picks out a mournful tune on his banjo. You object on religious grounds? Well guess what? We have religious freedom too!! Amazing or what? Apart from not being able to find any direct reference to abortion in any valid religious text, we can and do frequently ignore religious rules, they aren't our laws. If a woman falls pregnant and doesn't feel able or willing to bring a child into the world she is free, that freedom thing again, to terminate, she doesn't do it lightly, it's a big decision for them. They certainly don't need unconcerned strangers telling them what to think, we leave that to backward, totalitarian dictatorships. It's none of the government's business, or anyone else's. Another thing that developed countries have dealt with is the death penalty. Even the religious people, the mindless knuckle draggers who need to be told what to think, know that killing is wrong. Fairly clear stance from the Christian cultists, “Thou shalt not kill”. That's pretty unambiguous. All advanced cultures have realised that, apart from the initial feeling of revenge, killing people achieves nothing. (Again, the Christians are unequivocal, “Vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord\\") there will always be mistakes and miscarriages of justice. Once someone has been killed there's nothing much you can do to put things right. Even in fair and just legal systems mistakes are made, imagine how much worse things are in racist states where simply being the wrong colour is a huge disadvantage. Yet again I refer to the cultist's handbook; “Remove the plank from your own eye before taking the speck from mine.” Basically it's nobody's business how other people run their lives, especially not the business of racist, misogynist elderly white men who aren't concerned with anyone else's welfare. British conservatives are a fairly heartless bunch but they're far better educated than the trumpist scum that are pushing these ideas in the US.

There are two types of liposuction. In tumescent liposuction, the most popular type, a solution of saline, a drug to constrict blood vessels and a numbing agent are infused into the area to be treated.2 This liquid, along with fat, is suctioned out of the body using small hollow metal instruments called cannulas. The infusion of liquid can cause short-term fluid retention that diminishes over the next few days. In ultrasonic-assisted liposuction (UAL), the cannula releases ultrasonic energy to melt fat so that it can be suctioned out of the body.3 UAL has more risks than tumescent liposuction, including the risk of internal and external burns and a lengthier surgery.

The surgeon may reduce the overall size of the nose or refine areas of the nose for a more pleasing appearance. In some cases where breathing is can be improved through surgery, as in the case of a deviated septum, insurance will pay for some or all of the surgery.10 Bruising can be obvious after surgery but should fade over the next ten days, when most patients return to work. Rhytidectomy A rhytidectomy, or facelift, is a surgical solution to the wrinkles and sagging that accompany aging. A facelift tightens the skin of the face to give a more youthful appearance by gently pulling skin tighter, smoothing deep lines, and minimizing sagging. A facelift is frequently combined with another procedure, forehead lift, eyelid shaping or skin peels, to enhance the youthful appearance of the patient. Sutures are often removed five to 10 days after the procedure, but recovery will take several weeks.11 [LINKED_TEXT: How to Take Care of Your Face After a Facelift] [URL: https://www.verywellhealth.com/incision-care-after-facelift-2709814] Breast Lift A treatment for sagging or poorly shaped breasts, a breast lift repositions the breast for a perkier appearance. A typical patient will have this procedure after significant weight loss or pregnancy leaves the breasts looking deflated. Some women opt to have a lift and an implant procedure if the breasts are notably smaller than before weight loss or pregnancy.12 Most women are able to return to work within two weeks and resume full physical activity within a month. [LINKED_TEXT: Common Breast Lift Techniques] [URL: https://www.verywellhealth.com/todays-most-commonly-used-breast-lift-techniques-2710000] Forehead Lift Similar to a facelift, a forehead lift pulls the skin of the forehead tighter to remove wrinkles and smooth creases. This corrects drooping eyebrows, \\"hooded\\" eyelids, forehead furrows, and frown lines.13 The eyebrows are also elevated for a more alert and youthful appearance. Patients with deep furrows between the eyebrows also benefit from a forehead lift as the lines are minimized as the eyebrows are raised. Most patients are able to resume normal activity within ten days of surgery, but recovery can be significantly longer if combined with other facial surgeries. Gynecomastia Treatment Surgery to reduce excessive amounts of male breast tissue, a condition known as gynecomastia, is a permanent treatment for most men, as long as the increased amount of tissue is due to the person’s genetics. However, the majority of men don't require treatment 14 Some men experience growth of their breasts after using steroids or marijuana habitually. For these men, breast size will increase if the use of the drug that caused the growth continues. It is essential that men who know that drugs are the cause of their gynecomastia stop using the drug prior to the surgery or the outcome may not be ideal. Men with very large breasts may require a longer surgery with an additional procedure to decrease excess skin; otherwise sagging skin may be noticeable. Surgeons typically make an incision around the nipple line so that the scar is not noticeable to the casual observer, allowing patients to go shirtless after recovery. Most men are able to return to work within a week and are able to return to normal activity within weeks."},{"prompt":"What are the characteristics of a genuine person?","completion":"Being genuine is not easy.

What is Hashish and Hashish History?","completion":"Hashish, also known as hash, is a concentrated form of cannabis that has been used for various purposes throughout history. It is made by extracting resin from the trichomes of the Cannabis plant, which are small glandular structures that contain cannabinoids, such as THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) and CBD (cannabidiol). The extracted resin is then usually compressed into a solid block or paste-like substance, which can be smoked, vaporized, or used in other forms for recreational or medicinal purposes. The use of hashish dates back thousands of years and has been documented in different cultures around the world. Here's a brief overview of hashish's history: Ancient origins: Hashish use can be traced back to ancient civilizations, such as in China, India, and the Middle East, where it was used for medicinal, religious, and recreational purposes. There are references to hashish in ancient Chinese texts, Indian Ayurvedic texts, and Islamic literature, dating as far back as 2000 BCE.Middle Ages: Hashish use spread to the Middle East and North Africa during the medieval period, where it was used by Sufi mystics for its potential psychoactive effects in religious and mystical practices. It was also used for recreational purposes and became associated with leisure and pleasure.European influence: Hashish was introduced to Europe by travelers and traders during the 19th century and gained popularity among artists, writers, and intellectuals who were fascinated by its effects and associations with exoticism and oriental culture. It was also used as a medicinal remedy for various ailments.20th century: Hashish and cannabis in general faced increased regulation and prohibition in many countries during the 20th century, driven by changing social and political attitudes, concerns about drug abuse and addiction, and international drug control treaties. Despite this, hashish continued to be used recreationally, medicinally, and for spiritual or cultural purposes in different parts of the world.Modern era: In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the potential medicinal properties of cannabinoids found in hashish, such as THC and CBD, leading to the legalization or decriminalization of cannabis in some countries and states for medicinal or recreational use. However, hashish and cannabis continue to be regulated substances in many jurisdictions, and the legal status and attitudes towards hashish vary widely around the world. In summary, hashish has a long history of use for medicinal, religious, and recreational purposes, and its cultural significance and legal status have evolved over time in different regions. It continues to be a topic of interest, debate, and regulation in contemporary society.

Where we both had to participate in a role play game when we had barely known each other for days. I was a short-tempered, angry telecom customer, very irritated with the service and she played the role of a customer care executive girl at the receiving end of my tantrum. I remember getting deep into the role and scolding her like I have never scolded anyone in my life. It was all a part of the game for me, but it was very spontaneous and unprepared and she would have had quite a nasty shock, to say the least. Nevertheless but played along excellently, not breaking the flow and to this day I am surprised at how well she handled me, and the situation. But later on, she asked that question, and I was expecting it. Why the hell did you speak like that, Arun. She was angry at first, but finally I had her convinced not to take offense. Later on, this incident, and many like it, became the milestones of our friendship and we remember each one with a smile, having known that we have come a long way. And slowly, but steadily and very surely, she became one of my best friends. So what it is to have a good/best friend of the opposite gender? Well, if the relationship is platonic, it's absolutely the same as having a best friend of the same gender. You find someone who knows you from the inside out, someone with whom you could be truly yourself. You talk about anything and everything under the sun. You tease each other, abuse each other with the choicest of swear words. You are there for each other. Have each other’s back. A helping hand.And shoulder to cry on. She stares at handsome guys and says that to me. I do the same with girls and point them out to her, but she usually shrugs it off anyway. You snort coke together. Just kidding, not there yet XD. I don’t want to marry her. I don’t want to be her boyfriend. I just want to be there. Always and forever. Even when we grow old and frail, I would want to visit her and see her face brighten into the same beautiful smile that I will always remember. Because, I kid you not, when you are best friends with someone, truly soulmates, their gender becomes the last thing on your mind."},{"prompt":"Ernst & Young agreed to pay a record 100 million fine and to admit that some of its auditors cheated on required ethics exams in recent years.

I also had to choose a generic “credential” up there because I had two that were equally appropriate - “Movie Reviewer at Poly-ish Movie Reviews” and “has been social partner dancing for more than 20 years”. I’m sure many people have a preference for one of these specific activities over another, but the vast majority of humans enjoy several different things, usually in equal or comparable amounts. We equally like more than one type of food. We equally like more than one song or even one type of music. And we equally like (or dislike) more than one type of activity. There is no reason why these two activities should be a dichotomy. Which one I choose is usually dependent upon my mood or circumstances in that exact moment. Given the pandemic, I have chosen Netflix over dancing pretty consistently for the last 18 months, but the second my entire state stops acting like entitled bratty children with their fingers stuck in their ears and a gleeful determination to wipe out a significant portion of the population, you can bet that my quite regular schedule of movie dates is going right out the window for a while in favor of actual human contact and physical activity. And then, as in the Before Times, after I have made up for lost time and the reality of staying out late and doing strenuous physical activity sets in, I will cut back on dancing again to perhaps once or twice a week and settle back into a movie-watching schedule, probably a less ambitious one than the one I’m currently engaging in (4 Halloween movie marathons per week for the month of October plus a TV show watching double-feature on Sundays with the family).

It is the first vital to comprehend the distinctive sorts of fragrance, and how they associate with one's skin, before picking the careful kind of smell that suits a person. The primary contrast between the sorts of fragrance lies in the centralization of forces. The request of the most astounding to least fixation is first Perfume, second, Eau de Parfum, third, Eau de Toilette, and fourth Eau de Cologne. Scent items are made out of creature and plant-based fragrant mixes or esters (or their man-made counterparts), broken up in a blend of liquor and water. The proportion of scented matter (called \\"fragrance oil\\" or \\"essential fragrance\\") to solvable figures out if the item is a fragrance, eau de toilette, and so on. Parfum - additionally called concentrate or extract scent - is the most focused or purest type of a fragrance item, and is the longest-enduring on the skin. All things considered, it is additionally the most costly. A genuine parfum (fragrance) will contain 15 percent or all the more (normally up to 30 percent) of the vital scent. Eau de Toilette, then again, with up to a 10% fragrance fixation, is a lighter, all the more invigorating fragrance, and exceptionally suitable especially for hotter atmospheres. Eau de Toilette, nonetheless, fades away a touch speedier than Eau de Parfum. Eau de Cologne, has up to a 7% scent fixation. It is reviving for more smoking atmospheres and can be re-applied as required because of the quick dissipation. Eau de Cologne is sold in bigger parts and has a tendency to be the least costly scent. Fragrances are traditionally characterized as a blend of top, heart, and base notes discharged over a time frame. The top notes are the first fragrance discharged by a scent.

Now before madara got the ems he was equal to izuna in every way possible and tobirama easily messed izuna up so madara would be no different. Now the ems madara would be trouble if he uses perfect susanoo but if tobirama manages to tag madara the susanoo can't protect you from his wrath plus again the sharingan can't track faster movement especially one from a flying thunder god jutsu. Again tobirama is from a senju clan therefore ashura descendants therefore he inherited a strong chakra and life fore and can fight longer than madara just like hashirama plus tobirama has edo-tensei and he can summon numerous strong shinobi to keep madara busy and then slash him the way he did izuna. Now during the fourth shinobi war tobirama attempt a surprise attack madara but to no avail people seem to think madara was stronger but no because he said both brothers lost their speed due to them being edo-tensei and we all know edo-tensei are weaker than the original deal plus madara was alive and has hashirama’s regenerative abilities plus sagemode and rinnegan which gave him the edge.

It is similar to what you may see in some industries like voiceover: the actor is paid per sentence acted; since you are going to use only a finite amount of sentences and words per assignment.

She pushed the pads against my feet with her nose, turned her head and yawned. The Stewardess said “I think you have offended her” which is exactly what I was thinking. My lovely dog pouted until I redeemed myself with a dog treat for her. The look tho… it clearly said “MOTHER! I am a PROFESSIONAL and I do NOT need THESE! Just what do you think of me?

If all else fails, we ultimately determine whether something is human, canine or ranuncular using a dna test for sequences that are typical of human beings, dogs or certain types of flowering plant. Person is a social category in the same way as railway and book. We determine whether something is a person, a railway or a book through social associations and interactions. Humanity is an intrinsic property of an item. A sample of blood found at a crime scene may be human or something else (e.g. canine or porcine). Personhood has no bearing on this question.

Standard Hindi was born out of the Hindi movement in colonial India (19th century), spearheaded by the Brahmin classes which sought to replace Persian or Arabic origin words with Sanskrit borrowings. That said, all of the proponents of Hindi were well-versed in Urdu, and you can even find many traces of this history in Standard Hindi today. Some of these traces include: • Spoken Hindi/Hindustani (not the dialects subsumed under Hindi such as Bhojpuri and Awadhi) is closer to Standard Urdu than it is Standard Hindi • Hindi orthography (in Devanagari) reflects certain conventions that make more sense in the Nastaliq script, but owing to the fact that the first Hindi writers were originally Urdu writers, such conventions carried through (ex. गहरा instead of गेहरा, वह instead of वोह) • Sanskrit noun borrowings use the same gender their Persian or Arabic origin equivalents use in Urdu (ex. the borrowing ‘Rashtra’ (state) is feminine, as is ‘Riyasat’) • Standard Urdu is intelligible to Hindi speakers while Standard Hindi is generally not intelligible to Urdu speakers Hope this helps!"},{"prompt":"w do you wake yourself up in the morning?","completion":"Thank you for the question , this is a video shared on YouTube about inspirational and motivational quotes , this is the video :"},{"prompt":"What is the cheapest country to visit from India?","completion":"1.

The yin and yang of the band Styx included Dennis DeYoung on keyboards with an artistic flair, and Tommy Shaw who wanted to rock out. They always have had their tensions, but upon release of the huge single from Kilroy Was Here, the theatrical Mr. Roboto, things came completely unraveled. Shaw has the band name today, and Dennis tours separately as well playing the songs he was on. An Australian rock band had similar rifting happen when Supertramp got their big hit album Breakfast in America in 1979. Roger Hodgson had always been the artistic drive and principal songwriter for the band, but that album produced several hit singles including one not primarily written by him, Goodbye Stranger. Members of the band wanted to become a more commercial sound and get more hits like that, while Roger always steered away from commercial bent. This led to Roger going on solo tours and Supertramp continuing on without him.

Utilizing punctuation to your benefit. I love the “dash”--it can separate an idea or thought without chopping it up into two distinct sentences. It acts as more of a pause, but has a theatrical effect. My favorite way to convey a story is to have it play out the way you would envision a movie taking place. This brings me to point number 2. 2. In addition believe showing vs telling is key to good writing. No one wants to read word for word a description of something as if they are reading a diary--it’s more exciting if a description comes through the eyes of a character doing something or through an action scene. Again think of creating a story like the way you see a movie. 3. But what every person really should know about writing is learn to develop your voice. Your voice is like your brand, and it should be as recognizable as the McDonald's golden arches, or the BMW checkered flag. Your voice is something derived from years of writing. It’s not something that comes instantly. When people read my books my hope is that in a blind taste test, they recognize the style of writing even without knowing I am the author."},{"prompt":"was speeding when a police car going the other way flashed his light bar at me.

When I was 14, I lived in a neighbourhood close to my secondary school. I made friends with another girl who lived nearby and we used to go hang out in the park, just sitting around talking, people watching, sharing a few jokes. One time we sat on a bench we’d sat on many, many times before. I forget which one of us saw it first, but there was a small, black pouch on the ground under the bench. We picked it up, looked inside, and found a 50 pence piece. We literally both exclaimed at the same time “THE QUEEN’S NOSE!” For most of you, that won’t mean anything, but kids who grew up watching British TV in the early ‘00s will recall The Queen’s Nose was a TV show on BBC1 where a girl was given a 50 pence piece by her uncle Ginger. The 50 pence coin was magic - it gave her 10 wishes which she could use any time she rubbed the Queen’s nose. Obviously, it wasn’t really the Queen’s nose (- my friend and I both made wishes and I guess they never came true…although I don’t remember what I wished for, so there’s a possibility that it did come true and so maybe it really was the Queen’s nose after all).

Experiments have been done—and I assume probably still are—-with animal and plant DNA while still in developing stages, that is after fertilization but before full development starts. However as controversial as even that experimentation has been over the decades, there is absolutely no way to do so ethically with humans. And there is no known way to manipulate a grown human’s DNA in such a manner as to cause it to start replicating the “new programming.” Even experiments on lower mammals faced great backlash, and the process of implanting the fertilized eggs with the changed DNA was troublesome. Not to mention that outcomes would be iffy at best; there are just too many variables. Plants and animals that utilize external fertilization are much easier, cause no trauma, have shorter gestation times, the effects are easier to control, and the outcomes are more positive. To manipulate human genetics would mean starting either before fertilization or just after, then fertilizing a willing surrogate with the genetically manipulated zygote via in vitro. There is no guarantee it would work and if prior mammal experiments are any indicator, odds are it would not. Miscarriages are far higher than average, and the more foreign the material that was introduced, the faster the miscarriage occurred. If cross species were used the egg simply would not implant at all, the surrogate would pass it right back out again. The major problem with trying all of this in humans is that it stinks of eugenics, and nobody with a stitch of ethics wants to go anywhere near that mess. This would, however, make a pretty interesting premise for fiction—a story/novel or film, or a cool graphic novel—-if you could figure out a way to explain away the replication problem (although most readers would probably be fine with suspending their disbelief on that point if you could surround it with enough solid science on all the other points). For awhile in college I had a work-study job in a zoology lab. My boss was the Special Projects Director of the Zoology Dept, and the lab I worked in was where he was working on these exact kinds of experiments with Zebrafish. It was fascinating, he‘s very smart (obviously), and we got to socializing after I lost my work-study. We became casual friends and because of my interest in the project he told me about other projects that had been attempted that were very similar. He was pretty idealistic and was excited about the idea of being able to potentially end world hunger via these methods. These projects were funded primarily with grants and private funding rather than through university funds, but if the uni provided the space and some of the materials, then students could work on the projects as part of their curriculum. I wasn’t majoring in any of the sciences which normally would have gotten me the job but got lucky through the work/study program. That’s where I learned about this stuff, mostly through my association with my former boss. And this is just one small university in a small town, back in the early 1990s. Who knows what could be going on in the larger places with more funding and bigger facilities, nearly 30 years later?"},{"prompt":"f I proved th","completion":"How did this mis-match of a marriage occur?

However, it is important to note that economic indicators alone do not provide a complete picture of a country's overall well-being or development. Other factors such as health, education, inequality, and social stability also play a crucial role in determining a country's level of prosperity. Furthermore, both Bangladesh and Pakistan face their own unique challenges and have made progress in different areas. For example, Bangladesh has made significant strides in reducing poverty and improving access to education and healthcare, while Pakistan has a more developed industrial sector and a larger economy.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH): Bitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency that was created as a result of a hard fork from Bitcoin in 2017. It was designed to have faster transaction times and lower fees than Bitcoin.

Both play an important role to merge into oneness or higher ascension. Oneness does not necessarily having physical contact. Higher level of self conscious is more than that. They can communicate with each other telepathically. They will feel it when they both have ego death together which means accepted each other's weaknesses. Accepting each other's weaknesses is not enough, both counterparts must throw away their own dark sides totally not even a single thoughts that would bother them like daily bad habits for example shopaholic etc. If those are in them, they are not consider as the highest level of self achievement.

The proxy server plays the most important role in providing security. Client computers connect to proxy servers and request various resources on the internet, such as web pages, games, videos, MP3s, eBooks. After the proxy server receives the request from the proxy server, the proxy server searches for those resources from the cache to the local hard disk. If those resources are first cached, then the proxy servers will send them to the requesting computer directly on the requesting computer. If it is not cached, it will connect to the related server and the client will request resources from the side of the computer. This will then cache the resources from the remote server, and send the client the content that has been recovered. The proxy server can optionally change the response to the client or the response to the server for some possible purposes. One advantage of a proxy server is that its cache can serve all users. When one or more Internet sites that are coming up frequently, these proxies are stored in the cache, so that the response time of the user request increases. In addition, the proxy keeps the logs of these interactions, which helps in troubleshooting. Here's a simple example of how a proxy server works When a proxy server receives a request for an internet resource (such as a web page), it first searches it in cached pages in its local cache. If those pages are found in the cache then they send them directly to the user without sending a request to the internet. If those pages are not in the cache, then the proxy server acts as a client on behalf of the user and uses their own IP address to request the page from the server on the Internet. When the requested pages come to the proxy server, then they send them to the user. For the user, the proxy server is invisible; All incoming internet queries and incoming replies appear directly with the addressed Internet server. More at.

Here in the United States I would probably be characterized as a Democratic Socialist. In Europe I’d be what’s known as a Social Democrat, and a fairly moderate version of that political animal. I believe that successful modern societies must come up with a mixture of capitalism and socialism. Perhaps someday we’ll come up with something better, but I don’t think that’s going to happen for quite awhile. Capitalism does incentivize innovation. Socialism can deal with aspects of civilized society where a profit based system isn’t appropriate. In some circles, in the US, this makes me wildly radical. There are those who would accuse me of being a communist. Politically speaking, the United States is very conservative. I think the country at large is much less so. One of the reasons we’re so politically conservative is that one of our two dominant parties, the Republicans, has to appeal to a large hard-right block in their base. Through gerrymandering, effective propaganda and rather archaic forms of political representation, like the Electoral College, a minority is able to influence today’s politics disproportionally. For over a decade a majority of voters has repeatedly lost elections at local, state and national levels. But no matter how you slice it, the Democratic Party here in the US isn’t a far-left entity. For most of my voting life it’s been more like Republican Lite than radical left by a good bit. When folks would characterize President Obama as a radical socialist I’d laugh. He governed as a slightly right-of-center moderate. His incremental moves to the left merely brought us toward the center of the political spectrum. Liberals have scored some cultural victories. Take gay marriage. This victory didn’t come about through legislation. It came about because a solid majority of Americans felt that any right they had access to should be accessible to all citizens. A conservative Supreme Court agreed. It wasn’t about politics, it was about fairness. Yet, there is still a sizable minority that doesn’t feel every American is worthy of all the freedoms they enjoy. The liberal Democrats I know are not out to turn the US into a socialist state. They believe as I do that a balance should be struck between capitalism and socialism. And in fact, that dynamic exists today in this country. If you support the military don’t forget that the United States Army is a government program. So is the Navy and the Air Force. The Democratic Party of 2019 isn’t far-left. It isn’t radical. It’s moving slightly left of center after years in the political wilderness.

The problem is, taking a cold shower in the morning absolutely sucks. A low-hanging fruit that also works—after you brush your teeth, run cold water over your hands and forearms. Try to let the cold water touch lots of skin and keep it running over, holding the position, then, put your face down into the sink and let the cold water go over your face. Hold it for 5–10 seconds and I guarantee you’ll wake up more. Not only that, cold water causes a dopamine release that has no crash (falling below baseline dopamine). Caffeine works too (I still drink it) but it’s a form of borrowing energy from the future. Coldwater and sunlight are the healthiest ways to wake up. I can’t give in to sunlight though.

If you buy a relatively new family home (3+ bedroom) you're more likely to have a garage. However, the UK is made up of varying ages of properties, a lot built before cars were a household standard possession. But I'd imagine that just like not all UK family homes have a garage, we can also say that all those that do have a garage, some will most certainly use it to store their car. For those that store everything bar the car, it's likely used for extra storage in lieu of say, a decent sized shed perhaps.

This is not specifically Canadian problem, it pertains to any immigration. The average monthly amount for a new Canada Pension Plan retirement pension (taken at age 65) is approximately 644 per month (7,732 per year), and private employer pensions are very rare. The OAS (old Age Security) would give you - in best case scenario(working full time for 20 years with average salary of, say, 80,000/years) - additional 8–9K. There is an old age income supplement but its only designed to get you to the poverty level. The total will be less than 20,000/year in benefits. Some portion of this pension - namely, OAS - is NOT payable outside Canada if you have not resided in Canada for at least 40 years. Yes, you could continue working past 65 - but don’t count on it. The locals have had worked 40+ years, paying down their mortgages, upping up their savings accounts (RRSP and TFSA), and some got public employee gold-plated pension plan. Here’s Canadian retirement calculator: [LINKED_TEXT: General Information] [URL: https://srv111.services.gc.ca/generalinformation/index] to get rough estimates.

People who just say “oh we have no idea so it could be anything” really miss the point. They are trivializing and/or ignoring the huge amount of work that has gone into studying dark matter, both in space and on the Earth. Here is a list of things we know it is NOT: It is NOT something that interacts with light, in any way.It is NOT something that would go into the Periodic Table of Elements.It is NOT something that has a mass less than about 10 GeV.It is NOT something that was relativistic (i.e. moving close to c) at the time when it decoupled from radiation in the early Universe.It is NOT something that interacts with ordinary matter except for gravitationally, and possibly through the weak or strong nuclear force.It is NOT intermediate-mass black holes, or any other form of compact stellar-sized object. Here’s a graph showing the bounds from all the various dark matter experiments, on just one class of dark matter, in this case Weakly Interacting Massive Particles. There are many other things we know dark matter is not. Unfortunately the parameter space left of what it could be still remains dauntingly large.

I visited 4 cities of Bhutan other than it's border town of Phuentsholing and my suggestion/travel tips are based on that only. Here are some travel tips - Tip 1. Don't go Yes, don't go if you are interested in destinations. Bhutan is about the journey. It's about enjoying the serenity, enjoying every moment of your travel, meeting new people. All you want is a picture atop a mountain with a monastery in the backdrop? You don't have to go through the immigration process for that, such scenic views are in India also. Tip 2. Plan according to Bhutan time When I went there it was almost 3:30 pm IST on a Friday evening. Their immigration office works only up to 4pm. So I had only half an hour left to get my papers verified right? Wrong. I only have half hour to see the office helpers clean the building coz all the officials have left. Tip 3. Permit The permit the office issues at the border town is only for Paro and Timphu… this is the best advise you're gonna get - go to Paro first. Go to Timphu, apply for your route extension to other cities early morning then after you cover Timphu, come back to the office and collect your extension permit. Tip 4. Carry enough cash You may find 24 hour ATMs in some major cities but I didn't find them when I was short on cash. Also you have to inform your Indian bank before such travel so they make your card usable in a foreign country. I was so miserably short on cash with no ATMs open on either side of the border at 2:30 am that I was forced to stay with my taxi driver until the next morning. Not that I didn't enjoy this experience, but my spine disagreed with me the next day. :) Cheers and have a safe trip. Thats the end of this answer.

One day Llewellyn came home to discover his infant son's cradle was overturned and child was missing. Gelert appeared with his mouth stained with blood. Believing the hound had killed and eaten the child, Llewellyn drew his sword and plunged it into Gelert's breast. The hound's dying howl woke the infant child, who was found alive and unhurt under the upturned cradle, safe from the jaws of the monstrous wolf lying dead beside him. Llewellyn was horrified when the truth dawned. Mighty Gelert had killed the wolf and saved the child, but he had killed his son's saviour. Gelert was buried with honours and it is said that Llewellyn never got over his guilt. A village grew nearby - Bedd Gelert (Gelert's Grave in Welsh), and visitors can sit amidst spectacular mountain scenery and remember the story on the bench beside the protected tree which covers the grave."},{"prompt":"w and from where can I buy cheap flight tickets?","completion":"[LINKED_TEXT: https://hotoffertoday.com/landing/629f3bc70e49e3.33277988?programId=269450Excellent Customer service Quick changes and cancellationshttps://hotoffertoday.com/landing/629f3bc70e49e3.33277988?programId=269450] [URL: https://hotoffertoday.com/landing/629f3bc70e49e3.33277988?programId=269450]"},{"prompt":"The justice department has told the state of Missouri that they can’t void federal gun laws.

Dropshipping is a retail fulfillment method wherein a store doesn't actually stock the products it sells. Instead, when a store sells a product, it purchases the item directly from a third party, like AliExpress. This third party then ships this item directly to the customer who purchased it. Not holding inventory means not spending money on products that might not sell. Only buy from a third party what you’ve already sold for profit. Profitable? Yes, only if you do it right.

The water of the Gihon Spring would fill up a pool outside the city walls. And another part of the water would travel through Hezekiah’s Tunnel system to fill up the Pool of Siloam. I labeled the image below for better understanding. And as Josh Korn pointed out The essence of the issue, as the picture shows, is that the Gihon Spring was outside the natural line of the eastern wall of the city, on a slope that made protecting it difficult and consequently exposing the city to siege. Rumours of a threat of just such a siege, emanating from Sennacherib the Assyrian king, are what motivated Hezekiah to order the construction of the tunnel. But there was also a “municipal” reason for the tunnel’s construction. Since ancient Jerusalem (in your picture) was built on a slope, if you lived near the bottom of the hill, you had to make a long trek uphill every morning to get water. Of course, the poor lived in the lower parts of the city, so the advent of water in the Shiloach pool was a pretty good democratizer of a basic resource. After the First Temple was built, everybody except King Solomon had to walk up a reasonably steep incline to get there. That’s the core concept of Aliyah (meaning “ascent”). It’s something you only really understand by physically making the trek back up from the Shiloach Pool."},{"prompt":"w can I learn a dance? I have been trying, but I can't learn any dance.

The deficit may bounce around a little (see top chart below, which shows Trump’s deficits under his tax bill), but we haven’t had a balanced budget since Clinton, and are not likely to ever get one again. The national debt is now at 22 Trillion (see second chart above). There is no appetite in American government to rein it in. At the end of the last century, Clinton had an exceptional economy, growing at 4% or more each year (see third chart, with blue bars, above). There is no indication that we will ever get growth like that again — at least under Trump. Even with all his tax cuts and regulation-killing, Trump didn’t even break 3% in 2018. Both parties spend like hellcats on “defense.” Medicare and Medicaid costs are exploding as Americans age and go into nursing homes. Interest on the debt will soon take a staggering chunk of our tax dollars: By 2028 we will be spending a Trillion on interest on the debt, a Trillion on “defense,” a Trillion on Medicare and Medicaid, and another Trillion on the rest. The budget deficit will continue to break the Trillion mark. Social Security will likely remain solvent, based on past performance and legislation. But fear not! America has only recently exceeded the dreaded 1:1 debt-to-GDP ratio, whereas Japan’s debt-to-GDP ratio is 240%, and they are still surviving. (Greece failed when it hit just a 150% debt-to-GDP ratio, but that’s a different story.) So on a relative basis we probably still have a ways to go before economic calamity. But economic calamity is coming. Neither the Republicans nor the Democrats care about the debt and our fiscal path is unsustainable. Don’t buy into the “debt can be good” rhetoric: the kind of debt and interest on that debt that is now hitting America is truly a blight. At some point America will default, probably within the next 25 - 30 years. The rich will go to other countries with their loot, converted to other currencies. The only way you and your family will continue to thrive despite the catastrophe is by becoming one of the 1%.

Generally speaking, it is related to bacteria that builds up in the mouth and on the teeth—it is usually caused by poor oral hygiene or other underlying health problems. In some cases, bad breath simply means that your dog needs a good dental cleaning. Poor oral hygiene can lead to plaque buildup which produces odors from decay as well as contributing to other types of problems such as gum disease. In addition to poor oral hygiene, there are several medical conditions that may cause bad breath in dogs such as diabetes or kidney disease; these conditions make it difficult for your pup’s body to process certain proteins in their diet which create a distinct odor from the mouth. Other digestive issues like acid reflux and gastrointestinal diseases with inflammation may also result in pungent odors coming from your furry friend’s mouth. Finally, food allergies may also play a role; if your pooch has an allergy to something they eat regularly (like beef) their digestion may suffer creating unpleasant smells when they exhale or even drool excessively creating more bacteria growth in the mouth area leading to foul odors too! Overall, taking care of any underlying health issues and ensuring healthy eating habits will go a long way towards making sure your pup has healthier looking - and smelling - teeth and gums!

What happens to a material if its Poisson’s ratio changes from negative to positive value?","completion":"Poisson's ratio is a measure of the relationship between the change in lateral dimension of a material and the change in its axial dimension when subjected to an axial load. It is expressed as a fraction, where the numerator is the change in the lateral dimension and the denominator is the change in the axial dimension. Poisson's ratio can have a value between 0 and 0.5, with a value of 0 indicating that a material does not undergo lateral expansion, and a value of 0.5 indicating that the lateral expansion is equal to the axial compression. In some materials, Poisson's ratio is negative, meaning that the lateral expansion is in the opposite direction to the axial compression. If a material's Poisson's ratio changes from a negative to a positive value, it means that the material has undergone a change in its mechanical properties. This can be due to factors such as changes in temperature, stress, or composition. In general, a change in Poisson's ratio can have significant implications for the behavior of a material under load, as it affects its ability to deform and absorb energy. For example, a material with a low Poisson's ratio is generally stiffer and stronger, while a material with a high Poisson's ratio is more ductile and capable of absorbing more energy before failure. Understanding the behavior of a material in response to changes in its Poisson's ratio is an important aspect of materials science and engineering, and is essential for the design and optimization of many products and structures."},{"prompt":"What large predators still live in Europe?","completion":"– Wolves. After a time in which wolves went (almost) completely extinct throughout most of Europe due to over-hunting and conflicts with farmers, eventually conservation efforts prevented the species from reaching total extinction, reintroduced captive individuals to most remote regions (like Mercantour National Park, in southwestern France), and protected these wolves so well that their populations rebounded for the first time since the 18th century, rising to around 12,000–30,000 individuals or more, and recolonizing all of their historical ranges (including the woods surrounding Paris). – Lynxes. Today, there are no lions nor tigers in Europe, so another feline has come to fill the void: it’s the Eurasian lynx, the largest of all lynx subspecies (around 18–30 kg). Despite their vulnerability to deforestation, conflicts with farmers and poaching, Eurasian lynxes still have a wide range and a stable population of around 8,000–30,000 individuals living in the forests of Western Europe (including Spain and France), all the way to Russia. – Brown bears. Brown bears were once distributed throughout Europe, but pressure from over-hunting and habitat loss reduced their range and populations drastically – in France and Spain, the species is only found in the Pyrénées mountain range (around 30–250 individuals), but even in this stronghold, bears remain greatly threatened because of poaching and ever-increasing conflicts with farmers, as well as the locals’ lack of will to protect them. As such, bears face an uncertain future in Western Europe. On the other hand, bears are faring rather well in Eastern Europe, rising to around 500–5,000 individuals that thrive in their forest ranges thanks to heavy conservation efforts – and these populations are only increasing nowadays. It is worthy to note that all these three predators are still found in mainland Europe (including Spain, France, Italy, Germany and Poland among others), but not in the United Kingdom, where wolves, bears and lynxes remain absent since the 16th century; however, reintroduction projects are in talks of being arranged."},{"prompt":"Why do some people like to stay in an abusive relationship?","completion":"PEOPLE STAY IN UNHEALTHY RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE They lost their true identityThey suffering from low self-esteemThey are not financially independentBecause of societal pressureBecause of childrenThey want to teach him/her a lessonThey can't imagine their partner with othersThey think God change him/her in futureThey are manipulated by their partnerThey think they deserve it"},{"prompt":"w do I get someone's name by their mobile number?","completion":"Reduce Money Expenses How can we reduce our money expenses? 2 / 2 ChatGPT Reducing money expenses can be achieved through a combination of smart financial planning, budgeting, and adopting frugal habits. Here are some effective strategies to help you reduce your expenses: Create a budget: Start by tracking your income and expenses. Identify areas where you can cut back or eliminate unnecessary spending. Allocate a specific amount for different categories, such as housing, transportation, groceries, entertainment, etc.Cut discretionary spending: Analyze your expenses and identify non-essential items or services that you can live without. This might include dining out less frequently, reducing entertainment expenses, or canceling unused subscriptions.Prioritize needs over wants: Distinguish between your needs and wants. Focus on fulfilling your basic necessities first, such as food, shelter, utilities, and healthcare, before indulging in discretionary purchases.Reduce utility costs: Conserve energy by turning off lights when not in use, unplugging electronics, using energy-efficient appliances, and adjusting your thermostat to save on heating and cooling expenses. Additionally, consider reducing water consumption to lower your water bill.Cook meals at home: Dining out or ordering takeout can be expensive. Instead, plan your meals, prepare food at home, and pack lunch for work or school. This will not only save money but also enable you to eat healthier.Use public transportation or carpool: Transportation costs can be significant. Whenever possible, opt for public transportation, carpool with colleagues or friends, or consider cycling or walking if feasible. This can help reduce fuel, parking, and maintenance expenses.Review insurance policies: Regularly evaluate your insurance policies for opportunities to save money. Compare prices from different providers, adjust coverage limits if appropriate, and inquire about discounts for bundling multiple policies.Minimize impulse buying: Impulse purchases can quickly accumulate and strain your budget. Before making a purchase, take a moment to evaluate if it's a genuine need or a fleeting desire. Consider waiting for a day or two to decide if you still want the item.Negotiate bills and contracts: Contact your service providers, such as cable, internet, or phone companies, and negotiate better rates or switch to more affordable plans. Similarly, negotiate with your credit card companies for lower interest rates or seek better deals on insurance premiums.DIY and embrace thrifty habits: Whenever possible, take a do-it-yourself approach. Learn basic home repairs, maintenance tasks, or simple car maintenance. Explore thrift stores, garage sales, and online marketplaces for second-hand items or discounted goods. Remember, reducing expenses requires discipline and a willingness to make changes to your spending habits. It's important to regularly review and adjust your budget as needed, while always keeping your long-term financial goals in mind."},{"prompt":"the Bible against abortion?","completion":"No"},{"prompt":"w do I get a smooth finishing on wooden furniture?","completion":"Getting a smooth finish on wooden furniture requires a combination of proper preparation, technique, and the right tools and materials. Here are some steps you can take to achieve a smooth finish on your wooden furniture: Sand the wood: Before applying any finish, it's important to sand the wood to remove any rough spots, scratches, or imperfections. Start with a coarse sandpaper (around 100 grit) and gradually work your way up to a finer grit (around 220 grit). This will ensure a smooth and even surface.Fill any gaps or cracks: If there are any gaps or cracks in the wood, fill them with wood filler and allow it to dry completely. Sand the filled areas until they are level with the rest of the wood.Apply a wood conditioner: If you are working with porous wood such as pine or maple, it's a good idea to apply a wood conditioner before staining or painting. This will help prevent the wood from absorbing too much stain or paint, which can lead to an uneven finish.Apply a stain or paint: Apply a stain or paint to the wood, following the manufacturer's instructions. Use a high-quality brush or sprayer and work in thin, even coats. Allow each coat to dry completely before applying the next.Sand between coats: After each coat has dried, use a fine-grit sandpaper (around 220 grit) to lightly sand the surface. This will help remove any bumps or imperfections and create a smooth surface for the next coat.Apply a clear coat: Once the final coat of stain or paint has dried, apply a clear coat such as polyurethane or lacquer to protect the finish and create a smooth, glossy surface. Use a high-quality brush or sprayer and apply thin, even coats. Allow each coat to dry completely before applying the next. By following these steps and taking your time, you can achieve a smooth and professional-looking finish on your wooden furniture."},{"prompt":"it okay to leave a dead fish in an aquarium?","completion":"No because the body decomposing can easily lead to an ammonia spike that can kill everything else in the aquarium.

Let’s break down it into two parts: 1st part: The fate of a person is being decided by his actions in this life and his past life. How could a person's past life affect his present life? Isn’t it Nonsense? There is no past life. It’s just garbage created by so-called ******. When they don’t have answers and they automatically bring the concept called “Past Actions” How foolish it is to believe such lame concepts. How could a person's past deeds affect life actions affect his present life? There is truth in it. We should accept it. But, doesn’t happen to everyone? Nope. If we do good deeds they will reciprocate. It’s true up to some extent. But at the end of the day, humans are humans. (I will write about it in the next paragraph.) 2nd Part: Decides fate in future existences? Another foolish concept like Past life. (Image source: Google) Does Karma happen to everyone? Osama Bin Laden, a heinous terrorist, died at the age of 55 happily (a single headshot). Do you think it’s karma? If yes, Then answer this A good and beautiful lady was attacked with Acid by her boyfriend as she wasn’t accepting his love. Is it Karma? What’s the mistake done by her? Does she deserve this? or Children being born to Alcoholic, Abusive, Non-concerned fathers. What do you say? or A person helped his friend in need but later one ditched him when he needs help. Now?? Conclusion: If any good happens to good ones, there is God. If bad happens, nobody questions God. Nobody is there to answer. If bad things happen to bad people, Karma does exist. If bad things happen to good people, No one mentions Karma. Now also, there is No one to answer. That’s why karma is a similar concept to God. Vary from one to one. Once you accept “Good and bad events happen to everybody and part of life”, then there is no point in believing concepts like “Karma & God” “If you are good, there are high chances of life being good to you”. That’s the simple funda of life. Whether you call it Karma, Goodness, Nature or Real life, it's up to you. ~V!"},{"prompt":"Why do people spread the fake news that Indian demonetization was a failure?","completion":"You Are Victim of Fake News!

One thing that was prevalient among multiple societies is that a tyrannical leader would disarm the people “for their own good\\", before instigating a fully tyrannical approach. It was easier to take over when your victim lacks the means to fight back. I don't fully remember which of the older societies fell victim to it, but a more modern example was Hitler's occupation of Nazi Germany. The people were disarmed, and by the time they wanted to fight back, they either couldn't due to a lack of weaponry, or wouldn't out of fear. The first thing a tyrant does is disarm the people, because a victim that can't fight back is easy to control. There is also the fact that the Constitution doesn't give you any rights. It states the rights you own as a human being, and that the purpose of the government is to protect these rights. A man has the right to bear arms to defend himself, his family, and his property. Against the individual, or the country in which he presides. To infringe upon one of your rights is to eventually take them all, which might have been prevented if they had protested the first right stolen."},{"prompt":"w do I get the birth certificate for my child?","completion":"How to Get a Birth Certificate in India if Not Registered Here is how one can get a birth certificate.

Most businesses utilize content marketing and even the one who don’t are using it now because: it drives growth. What’s even better is that there’s continued demand for content writers because content marketing is on the rise. Businesses of all shapes and sizes keep investing in content marketing and 95% of marketers using content marketing plan to continue investing the same amount in the channel in 2023. Just look at Spider-man. This is spectacular content marketing from Marvel working at best. It is a content writer/content creator like you that came up with this character and his story. He’s the best in the industry and is the one and only: Stan Lee. This means being in the field is not only a good idea but also a good avenue for generating revenue. You can never go wrong with content marketing because it is constantly experiencing exponential growth. Organizations always have some sort of marketing efforts which means they need talented individuals like you to create their marketing material. The world of content marketing is also very competitive but that is not the reason why content writers have a hard time getting clients. The problem is that most content writers don’t know how to: a. Stand out. b. Market themselves effectively. With that being said, I’m going to show you exactly how to beat the competition, attract high-value clients and generate revenue for your business. Create a freelance website for your content writing business: Some content writers prefer to avoid the competition by following the long route of getting clients. They create a freelance website for their business. The advantage of this is that it makes you stand out and brings writing clients to you instead of the other way around. The problem is that it takes time to build a successful website because that generates leads. DUH, it’s a website. (Credit by Giphy) The key to creating a website that gets clients is to: have a good design that is not distracting (basic) and shows your branding, create content consistently using your blog that ranks on the SERPs using high search volume keywords (this helps you build a high-quality portfolio and learn how to write quickly), have a CTA at the end of every content you publish. A good example is getting your leads to either call you directly or book a time to speak with you about their content marketing needs. A perfect example of websites you can take inspiration from is: Ryan Robinson blog, Neil Patel, WebFX, Jordan Makelle, Smartblogger, Elna Cain and Copyblogger. Building a successful blog takes time so keep that in mind. 2. Freelancing platforms: Another option is to join freelance platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, Freelancer, FlexJobs, Toptal, and more. These sites do the heavy lifting of attracting clients to their platforms. The only downside is the steep competition. These sites have millions of other content writers just like you, trying to get clients. Plus there’s every service imaginable in there from content writing, copywriting, lead generation, sales, voice over and more. The key is to create an attractive profile that lists the services you offer. Then try everything you can to rank your gigs. Once you’re successful, clients will reach out to you directly. (Credit by CY Partners) 3. Job boards: Job boards list jobs of different categories across several industries. Businesses looking to hire professionals usually post their job openings on these sites which is where you come in. Just search for content writing jobs and then filter your search to reflect what you’re looking for. Are you looking for remote content writing jobs that are full-time or contract? You can get that. Filter your search across a variety of parameters such as location specific (country, worldwide, or remote), job level (full-time, part-time, contract, freelance) or experience level (entry level, intermediate, senior, advanced) and more. Some job boards you can use include Problogger, Indeed, SimplyHired, Google for Jobs, FlexJobs, Glassdoor, Linkedin Jobs and more. 4. Cold Outreach: A strategy that I rely on which is very effective is sending out cold emails to brands, blogs, or websites I want to work with. This is a good strategy if you don’t want to follow the long route by waiting for clients to come to you which takes time. A LONG TIME. Here, you are being proactive because you’re reaching out to people who might be interested in the services you’re offering. The key to making this work is in three folds: Reaching out to people who fit your target profile and are looking for your services. If you’re a content writer, specialization is the way to go. People rarely want professionals who can write every single type of content. They want a specific type of content writer. Are you a blog writer? Maybe you can reach out to blogs. Or perhaps you write sales copy such as landing pages. You can reach out to brands. You also need to target prospects in a certain niche such as digital marketing agencies, SaaS companies, e-commerce stores, personal finance blogs, you name it. Then comes identifying prospects who are actually looking for your services. You can inspect your prospect to understand how frequently they create the type of content you offer. If you create copy for landing pages, a good idea would be to consider ecommerce stores or other brands that bring out a shit ton of products. Apple for example produces new products all the damn time. If you write blog posts, consider blogs that create a shit ton of blog posts, like Smartblogger or Neil Patel. But what I found out is that reaching out to businesses who post content writing jobs works best. Not only are they looking for my services right now, they are also willing to pay. So I reach out to them with cold emails and it works. (Credit by VoilaNorbert) Personalization is a non-negotiable deal when it comes to sending cold emails to prospects. This shows the prospects that you not only know them, you’re also willing to do your homework properly. Call them with their first name and include their company name. Then find out something that is very recent and relevant about the person you’re reaching out to and include that in the body of your email. Did they got hired for a new position? Are they about to roll out a product update? Or perhaps they just published a new blog post. Include this in your email. Linkedin and Crunchbase are your best friends for finding recent and vital info about your prospects. Also, don’t forget to throw in a compliment.Email outreach is a numbers game whether you like it or not. As much as anyone might tell you that sending out a small amount of super personalized high-quality cold emails is what gets the job done, I’ll tell you they are right and wrong at the same time. Yes, sending out high-quality cold emails will get you high open rates, reads and responses. But they might not get you high conversion rates (booked meetings). Let me give you an example: Over the past couple of months, I reached out to VCs and Angel investors to contribute to an article I was writing about. The article would help start-ups looking to fundraise from high net worth individuals like these on how to best approach them and raise money from them successfully. An initial email I sent was to 22 VCs and angel investors that were highly vetted by me (quick to respond and gave in pitches to websites before), and the email was highly personalized. The result: Only 1 person responded with his pitch and I needed a minimum of 5. Obviously it meant there is only one way to get what I want: send out more emails like this. Eventually, and after sending a total of 105 emails, I got 6 pitches from them. And voila! I finally made this article - [LINKED_TEXT: What VC’s Look for In a Pitch] [URL: https://medium.com/financegeek/what-venture-capitalists-look-for-in-a-pitch-10122fec4ea]. Yes they are highly qualified and yes the email is personalized. But what do you think will happen if I focused on the initial 22 emails? I’ll still get only one pitch. The secret to getting fast results with cold emails is focusing on quantity while maintaining quality. Don’t believe me. Just ask the expert, Alex Berman who has generated over 10 million dollars for his agency using cold emails. To get content writing clients fast (in like a week or 2) using cold emails, try sending out 50 - 100 emails per day. But the higher the better as long as you won’t sacrifice the quality of the emails you send. If you can’t send 100 highly-personalized cold emails everyday, send any amount you can maintain. I find 25 to be a moderate number that still gets results even though it’s slow. You can start with 25 as long as you’ll commit to sending 25 emails every day."},{"prompt":"What are your views regarding getting a work visa in Canada?

Let hunger complete what lead could not do.” “The headquarters and staff company are moving to the neighboring village of Gorshkovo. January 19, 1942 We quickly arrived by car to Golovino, where I had to prepare the room. Cheerless thoughts were when the front line moved, saw tank ditches, far-reaching wire fences. Why all this? It is a pity to leave the area to this dirty, ragged people. Yesterday, the sky in many places turned blood red. Flamed villages set on fire. This is done in order to take away from the Reds climbing forward any opportunity to warm up and find any supplies. Dirty houses are devoured by a flame. The war is merciless, it means - we or they! \\"- from the diary of the lieutenant of the 185th infantry regiment of the 87th infantry division of the Wehrmacht G. Linke. I can add that in winter ALL peasants and citizens were evicted by Germans from their homes in combatant zone, and at retreat the houses were burnt. Town Gatchina near Leningrad on liberation had a population of 80 persons. Stalin did not order to burn Moscow. He did not leave it during the Moscow battle. Once he visited the front near Moscow, spent the night in peasant’s house and ordered to pay overnight charge. P.S. On November 17, 1941, the secret Order of the Headquarters of the Supreme High Command No. 0428 “... Destroy and burn down all settlements in the rear of the German troops ...” appeared. At that time German troops were standing on a tram stop 15 km from Kremlin. Report about a fulfilment of the order 0428 \\"COMRADE STALIN, COMRADE SHAPOSHNIKOV Pursuant to Order No. 0428 of November 17 on arson of settlements, the Military Council immediately took the following measures: 1. In divisions and regiments, they began to form teams of hunters, who in most of them are already active. 2. In the territory occupied by the enemy, intelligence agencies of a special department sent sabotage groups, with a total number of up to 500 people. 3. The armies were assigned a squadron of R-5 and U-2 aircraft, a total of 45 aircraft. 4. Manufactured and allocated to parts of individual incendiary means - termite fuses, balls, cylinders, checkers - with a total of 4,300 units. 5. Over 100,000 Molotov cocktails and accessories for their use have been issued. 7. The points to be burned and destroyed for each army were approved, and assignments were established, in connection with this, to the combat arms (aviation, artillery, teams of hunters, sabotage and partisan detachments). Over the past time, 398 settlements were burned and destroyed, of which: in the 30 army - 105, 16 - 113, 5 - 55, 33 - 17, 43 - 24, 29 - 52, 50 - 32 points. Most of the points were burned and destroyed by teams of hunters and sabotage groups; the artillery due to the lack of incendiary shells, and aviation did not conduct active work on the assignment due to bad weather. The active work of units of the front to set fire to settlements caused serious damage to the Germans, as evidenced by the following, intercepted by us, order of the German command: \\"According to a report from headquarters 57 ak, it has been established that in recent years systematic arson of settlements has been carried out in many places by individuals and groups penetrating the front line.

(At press time, the website cited the average payout even slightly higher, at 140 an hour.) Does that sound enticing? If so, keep reading.

Respondent is the highest paying online survey option I’ve found. [LINKED_TEXT: Respondent - Sign upRespondent.io connects you with your target audience for market research interviews.

Respondent is a company that pays you to participate in research studies. Their structure is much different than most online survey sites and apps. Respondent facilitates one-on-one consumer research studies and focus groups, both in-person and online. Respondent works both with individuals responding to surveys as well as companies and organizations looking for feedback. In fact, I took it as a positive sign that their homepage is actually business-facing: That shows they’re prioritizing getting new customers — the companies that need research done. In contrast, most low-paying survey sites target you, the survey taker. How Does [LINKED_TEXT: Welcome to Respondent | www.respondent.io] [URL: http://respondent.io/] Work? If getting paid for your opinion sounds like fun, [LINKED_TEXT: create a free Respondent account today] [URL: https://app.respondent.io/r/sammuthanah-13e1fe511087]. Since the site seems to have more a business/professional focus, I signed up with my LinkedIn account. You’ll enter some personal information and then you will see various surveys based on your background. It only takes a couple of minutes to set up your account and then you can start earning money. Let’s take a deeper look at the process. Sign Up Process [LINKED_TEXT: Sign Up] [URL: https://app.respondent.io/r/sammuthanah-13e1fe511087] You can either sign up with your email address or with an existing social media account. Since the site seems to have more a business focus, I signed up with my LinkedIn account. From there, Respondent collects personal information from you. This includes your name, birth date, home address, email address, and phone number. This is pretty standard stuff that every survey site will ask for. Companies completing research want to make sure they’re reaching specific audiences. These are designed to match you up with the best / most relevant surveys. They do this by asking for demographic information, including: GenderEthnicityEducation Background Filling out the necessary information should only take you a few minutes. Once you are done, you’ll end up on the main page of your account. You’ll immediately see “Marketplace Projects”, which are the surveys Respondent offers. Who is Eligible to Join? Anyone 18 or older is eligible to [LINKED_TEXT: sign up] [URL: https://app.respondent.io/r/sammuthanah-13e1fe511087] as a Respondent. From what I can tell, most studies are targeting US residents, but the site claims to have international opportunities as well. You’ll also need a PayPal account (so you can get paid!), and either a Facebook or LinkedIn profile to verify your identity. Filtering and Selecting Projects on Respondent Once you’re logged in, you’re presented with all your different project options. You can see how much they pay, how long they’ll take, and what type of study it is. Use the sidebar filters to further narrow down your options. Gotta love the “Remote” checkbox! I can answer questions from home? Yes please. Types of Studies on Respondent Respondent offers a variety of project types. Let’s take a quick look at some examples of typical projects available through Respondent. The screenshot might be kind of hard to read, but there are studies for: people interested in investing – 75 for 45 minutessupply chain professionals – 50 for 60 minutessmall business owners – 85 for 60 minutesonline banking customers – 50 for 60 minutesand more All of the projects clearly mark how long it should take to finish and how much it pays. There is also a brief description of what they are looking for in a respondent. Many of Respondent’s projects seem to have a small business or technology focus, but there are broader consumer studies that also pop up. For the most part, projects pay well, but there are also lower paying surveys too. You can decide if it’s worth your time or not. Projects can vary in their setup. It depends on the specific company that is in charge of the project. Most are one-on-one discussions with a company representative. Others require you to keep a log of certain activities over multiple days or weeks. The first study I participated in through Respondent was a 200 in-person focus group. These are just some examples of what you might see the more you apply and are approved for projects in Respondent. Project Screening Once you find a project you like, you can click on it and apply. To apply, you’ll need to fill out a brief screener survey to ensure you are the right fit. This usually takes less than 5 minutes to complete. Respondent has more stringent requirements to get picked for surveys. This sets Respondent apart from other survey sites and is also why they pay more. Companies are looking for honest feedback from the right people. The website will display a match score of 0-100 based on the results of your initial survey. If the company wants you for their project, they’ll reach out through Respondent’s system. Being chosen for projects isn’t as easy with Respondent as other sites, even if you’re a good match. You could end up applying for several projects before getting picked. You can see these in your dashboard if you click on “My Surveys”: I just finished one screener survey and it gave me a match score of 91%, so I imagine if the company can’t find anyone better-qualified, I’ll get a call. (I was “100% Qualified” for the focus group I was chosen for.) My 200 [LINKED_TEXT: Welcome to Respondent | www.respondent.io] [URL: http://respondent.io/] Focus Group Like I mentioned above, my first “hit” with Respondent was for an in-person focus group near me. Well, it was about 45 minutes away, which did eat into my effective hourly rate. But I wanted to go to see what it was all about. The study targeted small business owners and the company wanted to learn more about our accounting and bookkeeping processes. (As an Excel-junkie, I was shocked to learn my fellow panel participants still employed the “receipts in a drawer” method!) It was a really interesting experience, part of which included building a model of our businesses out of Legos: Yes, I really got paid to play with Legos! How Much Money Does Respondent Pay? According to Respondent, the average payout for a completed project is 140 an hour. This makes Respondent the best paying [LINKED_TEXT: online survey company] [URL: https://app.respondent.io/r/sammuthanah-13e1fe511087] I’ve come across. As you can see from the examples above though, not every project pays that much. My focus group was 200 for 2 hours. (100 an hour if reducing fractions hurts your brain.) All payments from Respondent are made via Paypal. Payments are usually processed within 8-10 days, which isn’t bad at all. My payment actually took more than 3 weeks to arrive, which was a little annoying, but it did eventually show up. [LINKED_TEXT: Welcome to Respondent | www.respondent.io] [URL: http://respondent.io/] Fees? Respondents are paid the cash incentive amount advertised by the researcher minus a 5% fee (or a 1 fulfillment fee, whichever is higher). The 5% fee is for payment processing as well as a service fee for facilitating projects. So my 200 turned into 190 by the time it hit my PayPal account. Fees are clearly marked on the initial screener survey of all projects. You can view your payment status under the “My Surveys” tab. Other Ways To Earn Money With Respondent Not only can you earn money by completely surveys with Respondent, but you can also earn money for referring your friends. If you know someone who would be a good fit for studies like these, send them an invite and earn 20-50 when they complete the study. Grab your unique referral link under the “My Referrals” tab in your account. Best Practices for Earning Money with Respondent To maximize your time and earnings with Respondent, it’s a good idea to follow these best practices. Set a Calendar Reminder Set a reminder to log in weekly to check for new studies. Unlike other survey sites, Respondent doesn’t proactively message members to let them know about new opportunities. Or at least they don’t send them very often. So far this year, I’ve received two emails with my “personalized research studies.” Decide Quickly If you see a project you like, fill out the screener survey immediately. As you might guess, remote studies fill up quicker than in-person ones. Respondent will also show you which studies are “over subscribed,” meaning they have more willing participants than they need. Don’t waste your time applying for those. Be Honest When filling out the screener survey, answer questions honestly. This may eliminate you from certain projects, but the goal is to maximize your time by only participating in the best surveys for you. This helps you and the companies seeking feedback.

Suddenly I spotted this guy who sat in front of me, whom I think is some native to that place lifts his legs to the front row seat after ensuring that no one is seated in front as if he thinks the seat was brought from his home. This act has been so common in all the movie theaters and if the theatre is in some semi-urban region then people will even start smoking inside. Seriously, why is this happening in all the normal class movie theaters that I have ever gone all the time?

This is a generous person who does good at the expense of his future births. Financially, they may have debts, incomplete education, lack of favorable professional opportunities, unstable minds, and few close friends. Classical texts mention a propensity for adultery and a small number of children. * * * * * * * * * Mercury in the twelfth house : This is a bad placement for Mercury. Mercury here gives cruelty, expense, poverty, shame, extramarital affairs, lawsuits, false accusations. Bad position for education. These are closed, shy, unsociable people. They may have the ability to communicate with otherworldly forces. Mercury gives a kind, religious mother and success to younger siblings. A favorably placed Mercury can direct a person to charity and care for the weak. Retrograde Mercury in the 12th house : This is a person who did not work off previous karma in a past life. They have nervous impulsive speech. Their wrong decisions bring disappointment, failure, secret enemies. They need to watch their conversations and decisions. A person makes quick decisions, conclusions and assessments under the influence of Retro Mercury. They need to understand what their karmic lesson is and work it out. * * * * * * * * * Mercury (Buddha) in 12th house Generosity, philanthropy and spiritual knowledge, unstable mind, debt, incomplete education, lack of favorable professional opportunities, propensity for adultery and a small number of children. However, this person does many good deeds, and his future life is happier than the present. * * * * * * * * * Mercury in 12th house : Clairvoyant, poet, generous, always willing to help others, passive. Excellent position for research and behind-the-scenes work. When Mercury is in conjunction with one of the lunar nodes in the 6th, 8th or 12th house, nervous diseases occur. * * * * * * * * * Bhrigu-sutra 4.76-81 The owner of such a position of Mercury in the horoscope will become a scientist. He will distribute his things to those in need. If Mercury is associated with malefic planets, the person will have an unstable mind and will oppose the king or government. In the case of conjunction with a favorable planet, the owner of the horoscope will spend money on religious purposes or charity. He will have insufficient or incomplete education. Comments: The 12th house is the house of waste, loss and expenditure - vyaya bhava. The favorable nature of Mercury is manifested in the fact that it encourages the owner of the horoscope to engage in charity work and distribute basic necessities to those in need. The 12th house is the house of occult knowledge and future births. Being in it, Mercury speaks of the desire for transcendental knowledge and indicates that in this life the owner of the horoscope, through his good deeds, accumulates favorable karma, the results of which he will receive only in the next birth. The word 'gyananavan' [ gyanavan] in sutra 76 should be translated as 'learned', not 'educated'. And, indeed, as our practical experience shows, Vidya-karaka Mercury, being in the 12th house, speaks of an incomplete academic education. Being the second house to the 11th, the 12th house indicates betrayal and deceit by friends. But the favorable character of Mercury softens these indicators (if Mercury is not afflicted) and gives the owner of the horoscope a small number of close friends. To the characteristics of Mercury in the 12th house one can add a propensity for adultery and a small number of children, since the 12th house is the sixth to the 7th and the eighth to the 5th house. Other opinions regarding Mercury in the 12th house: \\"Brihat Jataka\\" - the owner of the horoscope will be demoted or humiliated. \\"Phaladipika\\" - poverty, laziness, cruelty, ignorance and humiliation. \\"Saravali\\" - a person with such a standing of Mercury in the horoscope will be lazy, poor, cruel, humiliated, but truthful and have a good oratorical gift. \\"Chamatkar-chintamani\\" - the owner of the horoscope will instill fear in his enemies and will be merciful to the brahmins. Note: Along with the Bhrigu Sutra, all sources mention mixed results of Mercury being in the 12th house. Bhrigu-sutra with commentary * * * * * * * * * \\"Jataka-Bharanam\\" 17.48 Results of the position of Mercury (Buddhi) in the 12th house If Buddhi is located in the 12th Bhava, a person is devoid of mercy, abandoned by loved ones, dexterous, skillful in achieving his goals, wins others over to his side, cunning and crafty, has an impure heart. Comments : With Buddha [Mercury] in the 12th Bhava [house], a person wastes his mental strength and time. He will show a tendency to go to the limit in everything. Due to Mercury in the 12th house, a person is educated but cannot properly use it due to his inability to achieve the goal."},{"prompt":"Why do cats in Istanbul rule the roost?","completion":"Maybe they learned from the sultans."},{"prompt":"was speeding when a police car going the other way flashed his light bar at me.

There is no single entity or group that has absolute control over the entire world. Instead, power and influence are distributed among various actors, including governments, multinational corporations, international organizations, financial institutions, political leaders, and other influential individuals and groups. Governments play a significant role in running their respective countries and shaping global policies. Powerful countries and alliances often have a major impact on global affairs through economic, military, and diplomatic influence. Multinational corporations wield significant economic power and can influence policies and decisions in various countries due to their global reach and financial clout. International organizations like the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), and World Trade Organization (WTO) also play a role in shaping global governance and addressing international issues. Moreover, the media, technology companies, and influential individuals can also have an impact on shaping public opinions and influencing global narratives. It's important to note that power dynamics are constantly evolving, and different entities may have varying levels of influence at different times and in different contexts.

We got pretty good at spotting them, there would be the urgent call for the ambulance, the pickup surrounded by intoxicated friends and family weeping and wailing, calls to “help my brother/son/aunty” I worked remote, in the Australian outback, calling for an evacuation meant spending thousands of dollars on an RFDS (Royal flying doctor service) flight. The ‘fitter’ would be lying flapping wildly on the ground - or, for change of scene, lying in seeming catatonia. A chaotic trip to the clinic would ensue whilst trying to figure desperately if this was ‘the real thing’ or not. At the clinic attempts would be made to exclude family - witnesses provided the ‘oxygen’ for the fitter to continue the act. This was performance art. Then the intervention. Verbal encouragement, “come on, they’ve all gone now” “what's going on” “ I don’t have time for this”. “Oh for f***ks sake wake up”. An oral Airway insertion ( Guedels) would normally reveal the prescence of an inexperienced faker, as they eject the airway. The IV insertion would weed out a few more - and prepare for drug administration in case this was “the real deal”. Then came the opening of the eyes and the bright light - avoidance of which indicated a ‘faker’. Application of pain could come next - squishing the nail bed between a pen and your own fingers. Interventions are added layer on layer, trying to get the assumed ‘faker’ to wake before being forced to apply any expensive or potentially injurious interventions to ‘cover your arse’ in case you are wrong this time. Loud noises, application of cold, discussions of the need to use “the brain needle” followed by a squirt of saline in the ear - all have been tried, and all have failed at times. Another dark night another ‘faker’. Oral airway, 2 IV’s , even , eventually, an Indwelling urinary catheter, every intervention we could think of within reason - slowly it was dawning - was this, in spite of all appearances “the real deal” was something else going on, could anyone keep pretending through all these interventions and admonitions? Apologetic call to RFDS follows, “We are sure he’s faking, but maybe not. No we tried that, yep, and that, uh huh, that too”. Wait 3 hours, plane arrives, family wail at airfield. They know what midnight evacuations often mean, not good. All wave. Wails, sobs, sense of impending doom palpable to all witnesses. Plane takes off, shaking heads we leave, wow, missed that one - was really sick, and we thought he was faking - need to recalibrate the empathy, cut more slack to the next ‘faker’. Next morning. Advice from RFDS base. Plane landed at the coast. Stretcher unloaded. Patient became agitated while in stretcher on Tarmac. Spat airway out, tore out IV’s. Undid restraints and before he sprinted away from the plane the stunned medics witnessed him tear his indwelling catheter from his penis. The patient was last seen vaulting the fence at the side of the airfield. An Oscar-worthy performance. He must have really wanted to get to town."},{"prompt":"w difficult was it for you to find your life purpose?","completion":"The question presumes there is such a purpose.

Marvel changed a lot of his features, anyway, so if another media outlet sticks to his actual mythology description, they’re fine. He is red headed and has a large beard at the very least in myths, so that version is basically up for grabs. DC’s version actually looks most like the mythology."},{"prompt":"Why don't small civil jets use high bypass turbofans?","completion":"Small civil jets typically do not use high bypass turbofans for several reasons, including: Cost: High bypass turbofans are more expensive to produce and maintain than other types of engines, making them less appealing for small civil jets that typically operate on tighter budgets.Weight: High bypass turbofans are typically larger and heavier than other types of engines, which can be an issue for small civil jets that are designed to be lightweight and compact.Performance: High bypass turbofans are designed for large, commercial airliners and may not be optimized for the performance requirements of small civil jets, which typically have different operating conditions and demands.Fuel efficiency: High bypass turbofans are more fuel efficient than other types of engines, but this advantage is more pronounced at higher altitudes and higher speeds, which are not typically encountered by small civil jets. Instead, small civil jets typically use lower bypass turbofans or turboprops, which are smaller, lighter, and more cost-effective. These engines are well-suited for the performance requirements of small civil jets, and can provide the necessary thrust and fuel efficiency for these aircraft to operate effectively."},{"prompt":"Why can’t I tell a narcissist how I really feel about how they treated me?","completion":"Because they are what they are.

Stars like Sirius B- which is a binary of the brightest star in our heavens, but too dim and advanced in its evolution to be seen against its brilliant partner- is massive enough to produce iron, but not gold. The elements so produced are only released when the stars explode, distributing them round the galaxy. The really heavy elements like gold only seem to occur in binary systems where the two stars collide in a huge cataclysmic explosion, briefly able to synthesize the heavy elements from the lighter ones on their component stars. Supernovae- stellar explosions - have been observed through history, noted as “vanishing stars”, as all that is left is the expanding cloud of material, and that is how the elements are distributed - including gold, but because the conditions under which gold is produced are much rarer, so is the element. Our bodies are made from the more common elements, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, with small amounts of heavier ones like iron, zinc, sodium, potassium, selenium and copper used in essential chemical reactions which our body needs. (Gold is unreactive, so we don’t need it in our bodies!)"},{"prompt":"the Big Whisper theory using the same scientific facts as the Big Bang theory a good alternative?","completion":"A2A: No. The so-called “Big Whisper theory,” which in truth isn’t a theory (it’s a hypothesis), states: The Big Whisper theory is based on a large ball of Dark Matter blocking and indirectly warping some parts of dark energy into becoming matter. That ball of Dark Matter did not materialize itself; it had a radius of 380,000 light years. To some extent, it may have been hollow on the inside, but could have been a solid ball of Dark Matter as well. There is no reason to believe any of this. “Blocking and indirectly warping some parts of dark energy”? Blocking from what? What, precisely, does “warping” even mean? “Into becoming matter”? So if dark matter blocks dark energy, it changes into matter? Really? This isn’t a scientific hypothesis. It’s random scientific-sounding words strung together by an Internet crank."},{"prompt":"it true that Lord Shiva is not mentioned in the Vedas?","completion":"That depends on your understanding of Shiva.

Keep in mind not tolerating well is somewhat different than having an allergic reaction. Just like us, dogs tolerance to certain foods is personal and general. Example: a lot of humans don’t tolerate milk well but we’ve just got used to the bloated feeling, etc. It’s good to vary food and try different food semi-regularly and monitor how your dog responds. Chicken allergies are only about 10% of dog’s who already have food allergies. My company WOOOF nutrition accounts for that in our allergy supplement by substituting in turkey, but for the rest the allergen rate for chicken is pretty overstated."},{"prompt":"Where do I find a local professional knitter?

Suppose a person has bought Maruti 800 with his hard earned money…for him this is an achievement…a dream come true…but at the same time a notification of Instagram popped up…upon opening it, he found out that his friend has bought Mercedes…suddenly all his happiness has lost…why?…because he is now comparing his maruti 800 with his friends Mercedes. Another reason is social media… This generation is searching happiness on the screen…they have to impress the people that are not actually there for them. This generation is dying for social validation from some unknown person. This is bitter truth but social media is killing the happiness of most of the people. Social media encourages showing off the things…but people needs to understand that all the things that are shown on social media is not the truth. Social Media is a beautiful Myth…. These are the lines from a poem “ Devasena ka Geet” by legendary Jai Shankar Prasad… लगी सतृष्ण दीठ थी सबकी,रही बचाए फिरती कबकी।मेरी आशा आह! बावली,तूने खो दी सकल कमाई। By these lines Prasad is writing about the Hope…hope is something that doesn't allow individual to accept and live in the reality… Same thing has done by Social Media these days… Suppose there are two best friends…Anjali and Ayush. Anjali is highly ambitious…for her social validation is everything…she is highly active on the social media. Their friendship is something everyone admired. Their friendship is a matter of discussion for most of the people.Even they put their images together on the stories of insta, status, Snapchat everywhere. Other people thought that this is what the true friendship is… But there is a plot twist…. On closely analysing one can easily uncover the truth… What Anjali does always is…. Meeting with Ayush…fight with him for every small things…blames him…and left.Whenever Ayush was alone…he asked Anjali to come and spend some time with him …She always ignored him and makes plan with her boyfriend.And if by chance Ayush went out with his some other female friends…Anjali again fight with him for this…and make him apologize every single time.But on social media they are buddies. Atleast this is what everyone thought. This story told us that everything on the social media is not the reality. In front both Ayush and Anjali are happily looking besties that everyone admired…Anjali is a sweet girl for everyone…but only Ayush knows the reality….that how toxic she is…. Here are something I never understand…. First of all maintaining those streaks of Snapchat.Taking the pics of food everyday…everytime and sending it to everyone.Always updating everyone about everything that you are doing…what is the need for this ….there is something called privacy. But the answer is simple…this generation only wants social validation. And what they are actually missing is living in that particular moment. They don't enjoy that moment…that company of people but they are busy in taking pictures and posting it for others. This is the same generation which have no time to talk to their mothers for few minutes…but you can check their social media handles on mother's day…. That handle can make you believe that they are the best child a mother can have. This is sad reality. And after doing these things for social validation…if they are not able to secure that much views and attention…they gets depressed….We are all somehow addicted to this…We often check our phone frequently…just in hope that someone has texted us…but if the results are negative…. loneliness is there to surrounded us. This time …this is the major cause of unhappiness, disappointment, dissatisfaction, depression and what not. We are easily affected by the others…we started comparing ourselves with them…despite our situation is completely different from them…still we are comparing and everytime this is the killer of our happiness…. killer of our peace and slowly we start a war inside ourselves.

The battle easily could have gone ether way which isn’t typically true of most battles. There were numerous decisions made by both sides during the encounter that almost universally went in favor of the Americans and a different choice might have significantly changed the war in the Pacific (particularly with regard to duration) The loss of 4 aircraft carriers was extremely significant to the rest of the war in the pacific as was the loss of so many experienced pilots. Japan never again fielded a significant naval air threat in the pacific war. If you want to go back further in history the battle of Cannae is something almost all generals have sought to mirror in every battle since. A battle of “annihilation” that changed the shape of the world. The decisive tactic was using a double envelopment of cavalry against relatively immobile phalanx like formations. The far reaching impact of this catastrophe for the Romans involved revamping their military strategy to the “principles” and “hastia” of the roman legion. Guagamela and Alexanders famous cavalry charge is another really epic moment of decisive military strategy. Even though severely outnumbered Alexander forced the Persians to extend their lines and then exploited a huge gap by wheeling his cavalry into the gap and exploiting the break. Amazing general ship all things considered and led to the end of an empire."},{"prompt":"What are some tips for me if I am new to competitive programming?","completion":"To start competitive programming u need to learn a language and get good hands-on dsa and also you need to have a good problem solving skill.

This question comes out of the human ignorance about the intellectual functions of mind and conscience. How can I use a part of my brain if I cannot use half of my hands or legs, eyes or any other organs? Science does not realize brain as an organ of the physical body. That is why even neuro- scientists speak of all nonsense assumptions about brain, mind and conscience. Mind is an evolutionary function of thoughts creating feelings and emotions that moves the body into creative actions. Brain is an organ that co-ordinates the function of all sensory organs to create the intellectual function of mind and conscience. Our sensory organs cannot function with out the integrative and co-ordinating function of mind and conscience. It is a pity on science if it mistakes brain for the intellectual function. Intellectual function in a human being is a function of autonomous delusions that becomes desires and decisions. Any human desire or decision is only a delusion that emerges to create an experience. We call it mind. The energy of mind moves the body into action and creates a result. We realize it as an experience. All the experiences together becomes the personal conscience. That is why as one matures in growth, the conscience also matures into higher levels. Thus the question of any partial or half use of brain does not arise.

Will the veterinarian let me put my cat down even if she is not sick?","completion":"Legally, at least here in the UK, afaik a vet can put down a healthy animal if asked, but that’s not the same as saying they’ll actually agree to do it. If she’s peeing more than usual, as well as in unusual places, then it sounds as though the cat probably has kidney trouble, though, in which case if it’s acute she’s probably going to die soon anyway, and putting her down may be the best option. If it’s chronic, you may be able to restore her to reasonable health by getting her onto a very low-protein diet plus vitamin B supplements. Cats have to have at least some animal protein or they’ll die, but we kept our old cat Plush going for a couple of years with incipient kidney failure by feeding him mainly on mashed potato and pasta, flavoured with a little chicken or with beef consommé.

How can I get both systems to boot properly?","completion":"Ok, as usual, let’s clean up the mess. First of all, updating grub without changing any settings you should expect to get the same result as before. Not even chroot-ing into the installed system and updating grub in your live system you should not expect anything at all, because there is no use. Also, if Mint boots just fine, the boot loader is working just fine. Configurations MIGHT be off, but the boot loader is working! Secondly, a black screen doesn’t mean, the system is not booting. Which makes the assumptions by Christian Andersson rather useless. Thirdly, why are you using two distros? Linux distributions are tools for a job. So, do you have two jobs that require two desktop distros or is your system knowledge just so limited, that you can’t figure out how to setup up ONE of the two properly. Here is a suggestion: instead of wasting your time installing and maintaining two distros and switching between them, first find out what Linux distros are and how they work, then choose the one that is closest to the purpose, then skip the time waste of setting up and maintaining two distros and use the time instead to learn about the system and how to set it up and configure it properly. Of course, both mentioned options are horrible choices for that. One is niche, uses very uncommon tools and is used by only few people. The other one is bloated and a derivative of a distros that like Windows tries to make it easy for you and keep you out of the system as much as possible and thus is in the way of learning. I’ve mentioned that in tons of answers, which also include explanations. But who cares, right? Now, back to the question at hand. Another thing I’ve said multiple times is, that people can solve problems, not symptoms. A black screen is a symptom, not a problem. A problem can be solved. A symptom can be caused by MANY problems. A black screen does not mean it’s not loading/booting. A black screen can mean all kinds of things. Like wrong settings, the display not being recognized, wrong/missing/faulty graphics drivers… in fact… with Grub most likely it means, that the distro boots QUIETLY, meaning doesn’t show output on boot and there could be all kinds of errors. Like for example trying to use the swap partition from your install stick instead of the one on the hard drive and with the stick being gone not finding it… resulting in the boot process coming to a halt… and you not going to be able to see it due to the QUIET boot mode. The monitor could need a specific resolution and SuSE could not be using it. You could have messed up the UEFI installation. Those are just some well-known examples. The point being, start diagnosing the issue instead of expecting writers to guess and throw random options at you. And the first thing you do is, you disable quiet boot for SuSE and see what output you actually get. Because this is likely going to show an error that you can work with. Because if it would not find SuSE, you would actually get an error. So, that is likely NOT it! It is indeed far more likely, that either there is some issue that prevents working correctly with your display with SuSE or that the boot process of SuSE runs into an issue that it cannot overcome. Either way, we only see black… aka… we are GUESSING, not solving a problem. So, you will never receive a proper answer to this question. Not going to happen. It’s a lottery. Someone MIGHT hit the right one coincidentally. But what are the odds? My recommendation? Start by ditching SuSE. And if you wanna actually get to the point of being an experienced user and using Linux-based systems properly, I once again advice to actually drop Mint as well and go with Manjaro for example. Explanations are in TONS of my other answers. Btw, look into name conventions here on Quora (regarding your Quora profile). Update (due to comments): The default settings for Grub are in /etc/default and the Grub menu config file is usually /boot/grub/grub.cfg. Again, disable quiet boot for SuSE and see what actually happens and what the issue is! Dollars against Pesos: if you changed the swap partition, the UUID changed, OpenSuSE can’t find the original ID of it’s swap partition and gets stuck searching for it. Correct the entry for the swap partition in /etc/fstab for OpenSuSE and it’s going to boot! Funny enough, I’ve actually mentioned this exact example with the install medium instead of the Mint overwrite. I actually seem to have hit the right answer by coincidence. (Not that much of a coincidence, if you have a lot of experience though. Take a look at my profile!) There is no boot repair. Grub basically consists of the boot loader program and the configuration files in /boot or in case of UEFI, the EFI files in /boot alone. If you don’t change settings or anything, reinstalling the same as before is not going to do ANYTHING.

Everything You Need to Know About Accessing Call Records Legally and Ethically Yes, it is generally possible to find the call history of a mobile phone number, although the process for doing so may vary depending on a number of factors, including the country or region in which the phone is registered and the specific policies and procedures of the mobile service provider. In most cases, the call history of a mobile phone number can be accessed through the user's account portal on the mobile service provider's website or app. This information may also be available through the mobile device itself, either in the call log or through a dedicated app provided by the service provider. However, it's important to note that accessing the call history of another person's mobile phone number without their permission or a valid legal reason may be illegal or unethical. In many countries, privacy laws and regulations govern how and when personal information, including call records, can be accessed and used. Therefore, it's important to always seek legal advice and follow proper procedures when attempting to access another person's call history. In some cases, it may be possible to obtain a call history through a court order or other legal process. For example, law enforcement agencies may be able to request call records as part of an investigation or criminal case, while employers may be able to access the call history of company-owned devices used by their employees. It's also worth noting that some mobile service providers may retain call records for a limited period of time, typically ranging from a few months to several years.

Here is how the small story goes… I was a first-time entrepreneur when I started my business and (yes, I started this marathon alone with no co-founders) I quickly decided that we will be building apps to feed and grow our business. Coming from the tech background, I started building apps with some fellow software developers and we started trying luck on our seemingly fresh app ideas, starting from creating a platform to aggregate players in the vicinity to connect and play cricket together(CricFriends App) to connecting parents and teachers through a mobile platform to share any feedback about the daily activities running in a school. (Kidster App). We got our share of low to mild successes in our app ideas and it took us time to understand the voice of the market, during this course of action we have tried 6 different app ideas and barring few mild successes none of the app ideas were able to give us the growth we were working for. Yes, Businesses and business models do require Perseverance and we realized we should try our 7th app idea too but we should release a minimal viable product(MVP) first and test the market response, rather than going all in and developing a full-fledged working model to hear the voice of the market. It was in mid of April 2018, we started exploring options to develop a product to track & control the problem of smartphone addiction, that's when YourHour app idea got conceived. MVP was floated to market and to our amazing surprise very soon it was organically picked up by some of the influential Bloggers, YouTubers to fancy their subscribers, so it got initial traction and then cyclic virality helped it to bloom. Currently, YourHour app is now live in 143+ countries with over 1 Million+ users, 19K+ organic reviews, ratings of 4.6/5 and more than 700+ YouTubers have created a review video for the app. Last month our app got published in India's First Child Right's Magazine \\"GeoChild\\". YourHour app is now multilingual with versions available in 8 different languages in English, French, Spanish & Finnish, we will be coming up with more than 15+ languages soon. We are now extending our mission to build a global product for enabling future generations to live a healthier & mindful life and reach out to as many as smartphones addict users as possible and yes we still feel its Day 1 at work.

While it may seem difficult to go without food for extended periods of time, there are several factors that can help people manage hunger between meals. Adaptation: Over time, the body can adapt to a new eating pattern and become more efficient at using stored fat for energy. This can help reduce feelings of hunger and increase satiety between meals.Increased water intake: Drinking plenty of water throughout the day can help reduce feelings of hunger and promote hydration, which can also aid in digestion.Consuming more protein and fiber: Protein and fiber-rich foods can help increase feelings of fullness and reduce hunger cravings between meals. Foods like nuts, seeds, lean meats, and vegetables can be a good source of protein and fiber.Mindful eating: Eating slowly and mindfully can help increase awareness of hunger and fullness cues, which can help regulate appetite and prevent overeating.Regular exercise: Regular exercise can help increase metabolism and improve overall health, which can also help reduce feelings of hunger and increase satiety between meals. It's important to note that intermittent fasting may not be suitable for everyone, especially those with certain medical conditions or a history of disordered eating. It's always best to consult with a healthcare professional before making any significant changes to your eating habits."},{"prompt":"know most IDF soldiers are good, and harming anyone is against the IDF code of ethics, but why are they many videos of (bad apples) IDF soldiers who harm Palestinians and what is being done to stop them?","completion":"Here, in a very mild form (as if especially for you, such a nice person who calls himself the \\"future OLEh\\", who probably does not want to become a victim of a Palestinian on the street, in a bus, in a clinic, in a restaurant ...) it is explained why the Palestinians receive blows.

The OnePlus 6 looks like a logical extension of the design trend for ever larger screens fitted into the same size bodies. There’s a relatively small “chin” at the bottom of the screen where it joins the body but the bezels are narrow around the sides and the top. OnePlus has embraced what appears to be the smartphone trend for 2018, the “notch” – where the top of the screen cuts into the display to make room for sensors, the earpiece speaker and a 16-megapixel selfie camera. The 6.28in AMOLED screen is enormous, bright, colourful and crisp, with great viewing angles. Technically it isn’t as pin-sharp as some of Samsung’s top-end displays which have a higher resolution, but you have to really try to see the difference. The OnePlus 6 ticks every box for a top-of-the-range smartphone in 2018: Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 845 processor, at least 6GB of RAM and plenty of storage. But it also feels like a top-end smartphone, absolutely flying along. When OnePlus claims there is “no lag of any kind” it isn’t kidding. The entire system is incredibly snappy all over, from switching apps to launching the camera. It’s delightful. Now, lets talk about the s8……. S8 was released in April 2017, and it costs the same as the One Plus 6. Keep in mind that the technical specifications of the One Plus are on par with the iPhone X, I hope this it is clear which one is better!!"},{"prompt":"To what extent can we change human nature?","completion":"Human nature is varied and can be oversimplified into two components.

Have you been to one, and was the racism noticable?","completion":"I grew up in Glendive, Montana, which had a sunset law for many decades. This was a problem for the black porters who served on the Northern Pacific Railroad passenger trains that passed through Glendive. Union rules regulated how many hours a porter could work. If the porters exceeded their allowed work hours, they would have to deboard for crew rest and board a rested crew. Glendive was once an important railroad center for the Northern Pacific Railroad, complete with a roundhouse for locomotive overhaul and repair. The Glendive sunset law meant that the black porters, who were compelled to deboard for crew rest. could not remain in the city limits after sunset. My grandfather, Harmon E. Dickey, ran a motel just outside the city limits, called the Shady Rest Cabins. “Grandad” welcomed the porters to stay at his motel. He was criticized by various elements in the community for accommodating “n-words” in his motel. He told them to mind their own business, their money was as green as anyone else’s. Grandad was born in 1890, and his father allowed him to attend school only through the fourth grade, when he had to quit school to work on the family farm. For a man with only a fourth-grade education, he was one of the smartest men I ever knew. He was a self-educated man, who bought a 54-volume set of “The Great Books of the Western World” and read from them every evening.

The main theme is that you have Magistrates and Crown Courts for criminal and then County Court for lower civil orders and claims. This often means that the same people will meet the same judge, clerk of the court or magistrates on their various visits. For the magistrates courts, there are frequent lawyers who pretty much fund their life from public defence work. Some of these people are reconciled to the general idea that most of their work is going to be empty and hollow, so they don’t put in much effort and are happy to get the cheque at the end of the day. What often happens is that some of these same lawyers then see the golden gate of civil litigation open every so often. They will jump at the chance of spending several days on one client rather than several clients on one day. These lawyers are the open mike nights of the court circuit. They are not rehearsed and they certainly are not funny. Judges can be very variable in their mood and handling of the hearing. If you know which judge you are seeing, you get a good idea of how a bad lawyer will get treated. This can often go sour for the party they are representing. Any hole in court procedure will get picked up by the other party’s representative(s). That then does not always go into the case being swung in their favour, but it will to costs. If a case is rushed to court, without following all the steps, it could end up with the bad lawyer winning the case, but his client paying all the costs in the case. Judges tend to have a pathological hatred of time wasters and incompetence. In that small cluster of court facilities there are often offices for the prosecutors and also duty lawyers for defence. They know each other and it can often be a premonition of success in the case, either by skill or the usual choice of client."},{"prompt":"the NDA training the toughest?","completion":"For the new cadets, training can be tough but after some time your body becomes stable and versatile."},{"prompt":"Do people in the United States actually believe that gun reform will cause them to lose their right to own a weapon?","completion":"Yes they do.

It is part of the cultural and biological heritage of Africa. In fact, its African heritage goes back 7000 years. Africanis is descended from the dogs pictured on Egyptian murals, the earliest record of the domestic dog in Africa being from the Nile delta, dated 4700 BC. Today, Africanis is found all over the Southern African subcontinent. It is known by various names, in different languages. That is why we use a universal name, canis [dog] of Africa -- Africanis. But is it a mongrel or dog of no definable type or breed? Decidedly not! Africanis is the true dog of Africa. The type has been accurately defined, despite some variations in appearance. Africanis is the result of natural selection and physical and mental adaptation to environmental conditions. It has not been \\"selected\\" or \\"bred\\" for appearance. It is the dog for Africa. In traditional Southern African philosophy, the most important requirement for a dog is that it should be \\"wise\\". For centuries, the fittest and cleverest dogs survived to give us one of the rare remaining natural dog races in the world. What does it look like? (See full description of the Africanis Land Race ) The beauty of this dog is embodied in the simplicity and functionality of its build. The Africanis is a medium sized dog, slenderly built and well muscled. It is agile and supple, moves in a very natural and easy manner, and can run at great speed. The dog is found in a wide range of colours, with or without markings. A ridge of varying form can sometimes be seen on the back. The head is wedge shaped and the face is most expressive. The ears may be erect, half erect or drooping. The carriage of ears and tail is linked to the dog's awareness of the environment. These variable physical features are of no direct influence on the physical and mental well-being of the dog. When in good condition, the ribs are just visible. The coat adapts to the seasons, and can be kept shiny with the minimum of care. Characteristics Because the Africanis has for centuries roamed freely in and around rural settlements, it combines attachment to humans with a need for space. Traditionally it is always close to humans, other dogs, livestock and domestic animals. Africanis is well disposed without being obtrusive: a friendly dog, showing watchful territorial behaviour. The dog displays unspoiled social canine behaviour with a high level of facial expressions and body language. Its nervous constitution is steady but the dog is always cautious in approaching new situations. In other words: it displays a high survival instinct. Where does Africanis hail from? Even before the time of the Egyptian dynasties, domestic dogs spread quickly along the Nile river. At the same time seasonal migrations and trade took them deep into the Sahara and Sahttp://www.sa-breeders.co.za/org/africanis/] [URL: http://www.sa-breeders.co.za/org/africanis/]Decades of crossbreeding with anything that wandered into the rural areas has produced what some call a mongrel, but is now recognized as a true breed on it’s own."},{"prompt":"w do I cut a halfcircle in wood?

Was the Jordanian administration formally legalized?","completion":"A minute ago you asked another question: “Following the revolt, you have the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. How and why did Israel take possession of the lands that had been intended to be part of a Palestinian state?” I will answer both questions together. Israel never toke possession of lands intended to be Palestinian. The 1920 San Remo conference decided to create a “Palestinian Mandate” under British control after the demise of the Ottoman Empire. This mandate included the areas of today's Israel and Jordan (including the Golan Heights) The plan was to create a Jewish state WEST of the Jordan river and a Palestinian state EAST of the river. In 1948 Jordan illegally occupied the WestBank and Israel took parts of the lands intended to be the Land of Israel. In 1967 Israel freed the WestBank from the foreign occupation by Jordan. Now we have the situation as was originally planned. The problem is that the Islamic world never intended that the Jews would succeed in keeping their land. That is why they attacked in 1948, and 1967 and 1973 and many smaller attacks between. Yes, in 1967 we hit first after they threw a ring of offensive armies around us, and started shouting “Your (Israel’s) last day’s have come” As they learned after 1973 , they decided that they could not destroy Israel with armies so they created Palestinian PLO terror organisation. 9/11 is the result of that. Islam has learned that it can destroy Israel, the West only through terror. This will lead in the end to WW III. Here is an answer telling the legal situation the last 100 years: [LINKED_TEXT: Who is wrong for their actions: Israel or Palestine?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/Who-is-wrong-for-their-actions-Israel-or-Palestine] There is no Palestine. It was called that for a time under Roman rule and later after the Ottoman Empire collapsed by the English new overlords. Indeed, they, the English, were colonial overlords. The problem is the unwillingness of the Muslim world to accept a non-Muslim entity inside the Middle East. Surely not an entity created by the early “Dhimmis” of the Arab world. I mean those non Muslims who lived in the slums of the Muslim cities for hundreds of years. (Dhimmi=second, third class person) Since the Jews, who were the rightful owners from 1000 before until Roman times, started to come back at the end of the 19th century the Muslim world has tried to destroy the Jewish settlements in what is today Israel. By the way: Most of the land which was private owned, was private owned by absent landlords, living in Damascus or Istanbul. That land was bought by Jewish agencies for prices much above the real value. The not private owned land became national not private owned land of the state of Israel. 95% of the Muslim population were tenants and had no ownership at all. Today there exists a thriving fake document industry in the PLO administered areas. To give you a short history of the legal ownership of the area throughout history I send you two other answers to other questions: [LINKED_TEXT: Can you justify the building of Israeli Settlements in the West Bank?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/Can-you-justify-the-building-of-Israeli-Settlements-in-the-West-Bank] YES! YES! For that we need some history. I will not go back 1000, 2000 or 3000 years ago, but start at the last legal owned status of the Levant” The last undisputed legal “ownership” in modern times was the Ottoman Empire. They were destroyed in WW I and England and France took over the management of the whole Middle East, the “Levant” Their legality was universally acknowledged by the then existing League of Nations. The first partition of the area was in 1919/20 when French control was given over today’s Lebanon, Syria and more. (By the way, the Golan height were not included.) The English received control over what came to be known as the “Palestine Mandate” this included today’s states of Israel AND Jordan and the area we now call the Golan Heights. In these International agreements it was CLEARLY stated that west of the Jordan river a Jewish Homeland should be created. According the Balfour declaration of 1915 (?) Hereby giving international legality to this declaration. East of the river there was to be created an Arab nation. The English, beyond the back of the international community, gave in 1922/23 the Golan heights to the French “Mandate of Syria” (=actually they created the states of Lebanon, Syria and Iraq). In 1947 the English, again beyond the back of the international community, gave the area east of the river to some Bedouin tribes as Emirate(=kingdom). Those tribes were not original from this area, but got the prize as they “helped” (today we know that that help was very little) Lawrence of Arabia(=was an English officer) to destroy the Ottoman Empire. Originally they came from more southern area in today’s Saudi Arabia. In fact they gave 77% of the mandatory area to Arabs who had no place there, leaving the locals with the rest. Due to all out trouble between Arabs and Jews the English decided they had enough and wanted to leave. So they asked for a commission from the today’s existing UN to find a solution. This solution was simple: Divide the resting 24% between Jews and local Arabs. and all is well. The Jews accepted this deal. Better to have a little place of our own than nothing. The Arabs rejected it. Deciding that after the English would leave they could easily destroy the small Jewish community of 600.000 persons. These 600.000 Jews were legitimate inhabitants of the country, in other words: They were Palestinians. This rejection had as result that the proposal to decide the area never reached legal status. To get this proposal legal status at the UN it needed approval of BOTH sided. The English decided to leave. This had the result that the whole area west of the Jordan river became land without legal ownership. There exists a nice Latin name for land that has no legal ownership, but I forgot it. So the day the English left in 1948 the Jews declared their state Israel, but the Arab’s send 5 armies (Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq). Funny, but the Arab inhabitants, instead of fighting for their land, ran away, ordered by the commanders of those 5 armies with the words: “You can come back when we have finished the Jews of and take their property”. The world sat back and waited for the slaughter. Most leaders thought and hoped that the Arab armies would finish these cheeky Jewish, who thought that they had the same rights as other nations have. But G’d was this time at our side and we won that [LINKED_TEXT: war.] [URL: http://war.so/] then the situation was like this. We, the Jews, had created our state as per definition of the original mandate. In other words, legally. But the area’s occupied by the invading armies of Jordan(=WestBank), Egypt(=Gaza) and Syria(=Golan) were illegally occupied. Jordan is the Arab Muslim state created in the original Palestinian Mandate’s East of the Jordan river and had no rights to invade the west bank. As a result Gaza, the \\"Westbank\\" and the Golan became area’s without international legal status. This situation stayed until 1967, when the Arabs again thought they could destroy us. Again in this war G’d was with us and we won again. This time conquering the land that was illegally occupied by Egypt, Jordan and Syria from 1948. As this was a defensive war and the land had no Legal ownership we have all the legal right to claim these lands as being robbed from the area that was originally planned to belong to the Jewish state. So we have all the rights to settle there. Even if the world is against it. If you follow the UN behavior against Israel you quickly come to the conclusion that anti-Semitism is not dead, it is alive and thriving. We live with anti-Semitism some 2000 years. This time we will not freely enter the cattle cars taking us towards our second Holocaust. Like my family did some 75 years ago. But what about the Arabs living here, you ask now. They have their country: It is called Jordan. Let them go there. [LINKED_TEXT: Were Palestinians stripped of their country before they were considered stateless?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/Were-Palestinians-stripped-of-their-country-before-they-were-considered-stateless] There never was a Palestinian people. There were (and are) many tribes of original middle east roots who roamed the area freely until in 1918, when the Ottoman empire collapsed. The new lords (England and France) introduced alien ideas, like nation and nationhood, resulting in much upheaval and death. There never existed a Palestinian state, the name was first given by the Romans to the province of Judea. This as punishment for the Jewish revolts in trying to regain our freedom and country back. Back to yesterday. Until 1948 all inhabitants of the area of the “British Mandate of Palestine” were called Palestinians. Indeed, the Jewish first Prime minister David Ben Gurion had a Palestinian passport. It was the non-Jewish inhabitants of the area who refused this title and called themselves “South Syrians” and other names. Until 1967 after the Six Day War the Jordanian gave their name to all. On the day they (the Jordanians) decided they stopped representing the people west of the river Jordan. They told all persons from that area living in Jordan they were no longer Jordanians but Palestinians. In short, there never was a Palestinian people, only many tribes living in the Middle East. There never was a country called Palestine. There exists no history of “the Palestinian People’ before 1967. There exists no Palestinian, city, religion or something which could be interpreted as “Palestinian” if you don’t take in account the word “terror”, or the popular Palestinian culture that has evolved since 1968, under encouragement from the PLO and UNWRA."},{"prompt":"Alexandria OcasioCortez said Going by track record, I’d feel safer in a bathroom with a trans woman than a powerful male executive any day of the week.

Substitutions are typically created to exchange a player who has to grow tired or lac or who is playing poorly, or for a plan of action reasons (such as transportation a striker on in situ of a defender). in contrast to some sports (such as football game or ice hockey), a player who has been substituted throughout a match might take no more half in it. Most competitions solely enable every team to create a most of 3 substitutions throughout a game, though additional substitutions are usually permissible in non-competitive fixtures like friendlies. permitting a fourth substitution in beyond regular time is presently being trialed at many tournaments, as well as the 2016 Summer Olympic Games, the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup, and also the 2017 CONCACAF Gold final. every team nominates a variety of players (typically between 5 and 7, reckoning on the competition) who is also used as substitutes; these players generally sit within the technical space with the coaches, and ar aforementioned to be \\"on the bench\\". once the substitute enters the sector of play it's aforementioned they need come back on or are brought on, whereas the player they're subbing is returning off or being brought off. A player who is noted for often creating appearances, or marking necessary goals, as a substitute is commonly informally called a \\"super sub\\". The origin of football substitutes goes back to a minimum of the first decade as a part of English public college football games. the first use of the term \\"substitute\\" in football was to explain the replacement of players who did not manifest itself for matches. as an example, in 1863, a match report states: \\"The monastery eleven compete a match in cloisters against some previous Carthusians however in consequence of the non-appearance of a number of people who were expected it had been necessary to supply 3 substitutes.The substitution of absent players happened as early because the decade, as an example from public school wherever the term \\"emergencies\\" is employed.Numerous references to players acting as a \\"substitute\\" occur in matches within the mid-1860s wherever it's not indicated whether or not these were replacements of absent players or of players bruised throughout the match. The first use of a substitute in international soccer was on fifteen April 1889, within the match between Wales and Scotland at Wrexham.

It is not possible to appreciate the beauty of this theory without knowing ideal class groups, and some basic ideas of cyclotomic fields, where the Iwasawa theory “lives”. The mystery of this theory is that it links apparently disconnected mathematical objects: the ideal class group of [math]K[/math] on one hand and the special values of the Riemann zeta function on the other ! This was in a way “shocking”! Ideal class groups roughly measure the extent to which unique factorization fails in the ring of integers [math]R[/math] of an algebraic number fields [math]K.[/math] (Open Artin's Algebra to get some cool examples of such groups). Higher the order of this group, farther is this ring from being a UFD. We take [math]K[/math] as the cyclotomic field here. Now comes the astonishing result: Kummer said that if a prime [math]p[/math] divides the order [math] h [/math]of the ideal class group [math]Cl(mathbb{Q}(mu_p),[/math]then this implies that [math]p[/math] divides one of the numerators of [math]zeta(-1),zeta(-3),zeta(-5),....[/math] Recall, [math]zeta(s)[/math] is our Riemann zeta function. This forms the Kummer's criterion and such a [math]p[/math] is an irregular prime. Some are: [math]37,59,67,101,...[/math] Now, [math]37[/math]is the smallest irregular prime number. Therefore [math]37|h[/math].Class field theory also tells us [math]h=37[/math].This is a cyclic group of order [math]37[/math]. Now we know that Galois group [math]Delta[/math]of cyclotomic extension is isomorphic to [math](mathbb{Z}/pmathbb{Z})^{×}.[/math] An interesting question is, how this Galois group [math]Delta[/math]acts on the ideal class group [math]Cl?[/math] Take [math]sigmain Delta[/math] and [math]xin Cl.[/math] If [math]a[/math]represents [math]x,[/math] then we define [math]sigma(x)[/math] to be the class [math][sigma(a)][/math] in [math]Cl.[/math] For this special prime [math]p=37[/math], Iwasawa theory shows that [math]sigma(x)=omega(sigma)^{5}x.[/math] where [math]omega:Delta rightarrow (mathbb{Z}/pmathbb{Z})^{×}[/math] is an isomorphism stated above. How this comes is the content of the Herbrand-Ribet theorem. From this theorem, we know few things. First, it tells you how the Galois group acts on the class group. Second part is interesting. We see that [math]37[/math] divides the numerator of [math]zeta(-31).[/math] Order of the Galois group [math]Delta[/math] is [math]36.[/math] Therefore, there is an element of order [math]37[/math] satisfying [math]sigma(x)=omega(sigma)^{-31}x=omega(sigma)^{5}x[/math] The Herbrand-Ribet theorem falls out of the Iwasawa Main conjecture. From here the subject gets complex very fast to understand. I cannot make sense of further relations found deep into this theory. However, my experience is that anyone who knows basic class field theory of (preferably) cyclotomic fields and some familiarity with the zeta function would follow atleast the rough outline of the (start of) Iwasawa theory.

The word hell does not mean such a thing: The word “hell” is an archaic English translation for the Hebrew word (sheol) and the Greek word (Hades) that appear in the early bible writings we have today. These words rendered into modern English would read, “the grave or under the ground” (sheol), “the place or location of the dead” (Hades). Nothing about a place of eternal punishment. The English word “hell” itself was derived from the Latin “inferna” which is defined as: “of or relating to a nether world or place of the dead, hell”. This may have later been confused with the English “inferno” which has a very different meaning. It was Athenagorus (133 -190 AD), a professed Christian and a church leader but whose teachings, according to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, were heavily influenced by Plato's philosophies, who introduced Plato's teaching of an immortal soul into Christianity. In doing so he opened the way for the adoption of Plato’s argument of eternal punishment for immortal sinful souls. This was a hundred years after the apostle's and came straight from Greek philosophy. Hell is the grave, nothing else.

Start with the assumption that radiation is evaporated matter and matter is condensed radiation. This can be based on the observation that radiation carries many of the attributes of matter. It possesses electrical, magnetic and gravity attributes, and it obeys conservation of momentum. The difference with matter is that radiation can concentrate to any large value at a single point(any intensity), whereas two matter particles can’t occupy the same point in space. In addition, matter has intrinsic spin, magnetic dipole moment and an internal ticking clock- the zitterbewegung, which are not possessed by radiation. If now you trap radiation to go in circular loops and in a resonance mode(so as not to interfere and destruct itself), then the electric field in radiation becomes radial and that is the source of the electric charge. The momentum vector in radiation(the Poynting vector) goes in circles and becomes an angular momentum or intrinsic spin. The magnetic field in radiation is normal to the radial electric field and gives the intrinsic magnetic dipole moment and is along the spin. The inverse square of electricity and gravity appear as a result of conservation of momentum as shown in Bertrand theorem. So, the extra attributes of matter to that of radiation come as a result of the trapping. Observations also support the above. The early universe was found to be mainly radiation and no matter. In the lab two matter particles can annihilate and turn into pure radiation and the process is infinitely reversible. Not only that- you find that as water vapor needs a catalyst or nucleation to become liquid, but a liquid doesn’t need one to become vapor, radiation needs a nucleus to become matter, but matter doesn’t need that to become radiation. And like we have continuous transformation of liquid to become vapor then condensing back when in equilibrium, matter also continuously absorb and emit radiation in equilibrium. Finally the circulating radiation doesn’t have a hard core and this explains the absence of a hard core in an electron for example, which is the reason for adopting the point particle description. If we accept the above, we see that strings can be the same as trapped radiation in circular motion. Strings in string theory are energy and radiation is the same. The vibration of the string is that of the radiation constituent and the open and closed strings could be those for free going radiation and circularly going radiation- though the order might be in the reverse in this case! The size of the closed string is not a problem as the size of the electron can be as small as depicted in string theory. So people looking for the physical reality of strings ought to stop and search within this analogy for an answer."},{"prompt":"What are the common mistakes students do while preparing for GATE?","completion":"With a large and ever increasing number of candidates taking the GATE exam every year, a well-defined preparation strategy is the need of the hour.

Situations in which a hybrid turns off its engine that a non-hybrid does not (but you could manually): When you’re stopped at a stoplight or stop sign or in traffic. When you’re coasting to a stop. When going down a hill on which the slope can sustain your speed. When going down a slope that can more than maintain your speed. When “idling” to maintain climate control (e.g. keeping the car warm while parked at school to pick up the kids), a hybrid will cycle on only as needed for battery charging or heating/cooling and off otherwise. I find that a 4-cylinder non-hybrid using 1/4 gallon per hour while idling but a hybrid averages around 1/7 of a gallon per hour to maintain climate control. In addition, hybrids turn off their ICE when only a few horsepower are needed for slow acceleration or to maintain speed in favorable conditions. And, they recoup some of the kinetic energy of a slowing vehicle and some of the potential energy of the vehicle going down a long steep downhill. But that first group of conditions are more common and more significant than the last two. Only those last two require a hybrid vehicle. The others can be done manually by an attentive (arguably fanatical) driver.

If that team doesn’t count because they won a ring the year before with the same roster, I’m going to go with the ‘92 Trail Blazers. 7 All-Star-caliber players in their primes. This is arguably the deepest roster of the post-merger era. 3rd straight Conference Finals appearance, 2nd Finals appearance in 3 years (a league-best 63 wins in ‘91), and a 73% winning percentage over that 3-year span. The three teams to keep them from winning titles those three years? The Bad Boy Pistons, the Magic/Worthy Lakers, and the Jordan/Pippen Bulls. Danny Ainge made the All-Star team in ‘88. He averaged 19 PPG & 6 APG for 1.5 years with the Kings before joining POR for the ‘91 season.By the end of the ‘91 season, Danny Ainge had averaged 15.5 PPG on 47/40/86 and 5.5 APG over the previous 5 seasons. 25-year-old Clifford Robinson was one year away from NBA Sixth Man of the Year and two years away from the All-Star team. These were the two BENCH players for the ‘92 Blazers. It’s not crazy to think Jerome Kersey would have made at least one All-Star team had he not played on this uber-loaded POR roster. As it stands, Kersey, in ‘92, wrapped up a 5-year stretch averaging 16 PPG on 48%, 8 RPG, 1.6 SPG, 18.5 PPG on 48%, 8 RPG and 1.8 SPG in the playoffs. With these 5-year numbers constituting the ONLY player in this 7-man group to have zero All-Star credentials, the depth of this roster is made plain. Peak Clyde Drexler. Nothing more needs to be said. ‘82 ROY, 3-time All-Star, #4 all-time offensive rebounder Buck Williams made his 3rd straight All-Defensive Team in ‘92 (4th total) and led the NBA in FG% for the 2nd straight year. 2-time All-Star Kevin Duckworth at the 5. By the end of the ‘92 season, ‘91 All-Star Terry Porter (making the All-Star Team again in ‘93) had finished a 5-year run averaging 17 PPG on 48.5% FGs, 39% 3PTs, and 85.5% FTs with 8.5 APG and 1.8 SPG.

What it signifies is that for any economy to flourish: consumers need to have spending capacity.This spending capacity can be achieved when there is disposable income.Income will obviously be generated when there exist employment opportunities for the populace.Employment opportunities will be aplenty only when there is industrial development.In order for Industries in India to grow, the government needs to provide them sops and subsidies that will ultimately boost the economy. The below diagram sums up the Indian economy. It can be explained as follows: Explanation: Businesses produce goods for consumption. The income received from the sales is used by these businesses for remuneration of its workers. Thus if consumers do not have the finances to purchase the product, the producer will not be in a position to remunerate its workers. For smooth functioning of the economy, it is necessary that there is circulation of capital from the consumer to the producer and vice versa. Other measures to boost Indian Economy: Influx of capital from Foreign Institutional Investors: FII’s are an ideal boost for developing economies as they provide increased capital flow and fiscal expertise of international standards.Focus on exports: Exporting to foreign markets is the best way to boost a country’s economy. Foreign exchange reserves help in paying off IMF debts and also covers for import expenses.Make in India Initiatives: The Make in India campaign was launched to transform India into a manufacturing behemoth and to reduce the dependence on imports. Its benefits certainly outweigh the disadvantages. Conclusion: Indian economy is more of a consumption economy.

The willingness to shoot someone when justified, if necessary, is paramount. Otherwise, it’s an empty threat that will be taken from you and used against you. If all you want is a handgun to “scare” someone, don’t bother thinking about one. If it doesn’t meet those criteria, there’s no point in considering anything else. In addition to that, using a S&W .460 or .500 Magnum in the typical single family urban or suburban home is ridiculous overkill. A missed shot would end up in the neighbor’s house with plenty of lethal energy. Keeping in mind the above, over penetration is to be avoided. You are responsible for everywhere the bullet goes as soon as it leaves the handgun barrel. In terms of suitable calibers that wouldn’t over penetrate:* .380 ACP* 9mm Parabellum* .38 Special* .45 ACP* .45 (Long) Colt* .40 S&W* .44 Special Revolvers are very simple and easy to operate. A semi-auto pistol is more complex mechanically with more moving parts. One handgun I wouldn’t consider for defensive purposes is a “single shot” in any caliber. Regarding handgun calibers, I also considered the S&W .357 Magnum and S&W 10mm, but inside a typical residential home at the close distances involved, they have more energy than necessary, as would a .41 Magnum. Over the top are .44 Magnum and hotter large game handgun hunting cartridges. I’ve heard all the arguments about the necessity of using an Elephant Gun to take down the drug crazed, but that’s simply not true. Not panicking and good shot placement are key. Magazine dumps are useless. Without that discipline it doesn’t matter what caliber is being used. A S&W .500 Magnum won’t save you.

What is too much and what is too little?","completion":"I’ll state up front that I don’t the answer to this question, but I know enough to know it isn’t a clinically useful to know the answer to this question. Rather, more relevant parameters are the directly observable parameters: serum insulin levels and serum glucose levels and the time responses of each to a controlled dose of ingested glucose. The reason it isn’t worth knowing the total production level is that you can’t possibly measure it except possibly in highly controlled research circumstances where it is possible to administer radioisotopes and perform MRIs. You can measure injected exogenous insulin because it comes from a vial with known concentration of insulin. However, no-one knows how much insulin their bodies produce because it is not a practically observable quantity. In theory, you could derive a model of how much insulin is produced by deriving it from observables (such as the time response of insulin to a controlled dose of ingested glucose) but the estimates produced by such models are highly sensitive to the estimates of various model parameters each of which has hard to quantify estimation errors and ultimately provide no diagnostic value above and beyond the easily observed observables themselves. If a doctor is trying to work out how much exogenous glucose a person needs they will start by estimating the correct amount, administering the dose and observing what happens. If the blood glucose does not respond appropriately, they will adjust the dose and try again. At no time do they rely on an estimate of total endogenous insulin production of the individual - instead they look at much exogenous insulin the individual needs based on how their blood glucose responds to the administered doses. If you really want to know the total insulin production then you are going need construct and parameterise a statistical model that takes account of these factors: body mass of individualmacronutrient content of dietfrequency of meal timesexercise related factorstime response of individuals glucose responsetime response of individuals insulin responseinsulin sensitivity of individual"},{"prompt":"Can stress damage your brain?","completion":"👋 Stress is a common part of life, and we've all experienced it at some point or another.

After reading up on the true meaning of camp (the theme of the 2019 MET gala), I felt that it wasn’t quite fitting?

Especially considering a lot of his tour outfits had a reputation of being rather extravagant so we know he had it in him. But then I read a statement from his designer in an interview that put things in perspective and therefore the black sheer outfit regained my vote. “After such a colourful tour wardrobe it is nice to do something a little unexpected. This look is about taking traditionally feminine elements like the frills, heeled boots, sheer fabric and the pearl earring, but then rephrasing them as masculine pieces set against the high-waisted tailored trousers and his tattoos. The look, I feel, is elegant.

This is important as it will make sure the problem level increases gradually. After 20–30 questions the problems tend to become quite tough. Solve 100.This should be followed by solving problems in Codeforces and/or Codechef. Challenges will take you a long way to solving problems fast.Once you're confident you should definitely go for ACM ICPC and other competitive programming competitions - they are really a good addition to your resume.

They continue to bear the brunt because separation is the most challenging part of any relationship. There are innumerable reasons why people continue to entangle themself in an unhealthy relationships, and some of them are as follows: Many people do not perceive that abusive relationships are unhealthy to continue because they have been brought up in a similar environment. They do not realize that any activity of your partner which makes you feel humiliated, hurt, tortured, etc., is toxic to continue. People too often get accustomed to everyday pains and hence let go of things.A partner with low self-esteem and self-belief may feel that anything wrong in their relationship is their fault. They blame things upon themself and hence continue their relationship without questioning their partner for even once. This disillusion keeps them entwined in a toxic relationship.Fear of being isolated, judged, and ridiculed by society and leading the rest of their life lonely abstains people from breaking free of a toxic relationship.Parenting emerges as an essential concern for couples before they think of separation. The well-being of their children often becomes a priority for many parents and hence stops them from taking any step that might hamper their beloved children's growth and development. Parents as caregivers want to protect their children from mental and emotional turbulence and trauma. Therefore, they prevent taking any step forward towards parting ways with their partner.Many people place a higher value on their safety and comfort than on mental well-being. The fear that a divorce would cause financial difficulties, conflict with their children, and bring out baggage of plenty of other problems. Thus, they decide to stay in their current relationship and ignore their inner peace, happiness, and tranquility. Although they are trapped and dissatisfied in their current relationship, they choose to stay in it because of its safety and security. It is never easy to break away from a relationship which was once sowed with love, intimacy, trust, etc. Hence, many avoid leaving unhealthy relationships for their safety, security, societal pressure, and parenting."},{"prompt":"What do British conservatives think about such things as gun rights, ending abortion, ending gay marriage, and restoring the death penalty?","completion":"No conservatives want to change the laws on those things.

Sansa, for example, also smiled when she took out someone who used to brutalize her.","completion":"I don’t think Sansa was smiling when the dogs started feasting on Ramsay. Even if she did, i think that was okay. Ramsay was a very bad guy and was particularly bad to Sansa. He abused her physically and sexually. So he deserved the death he got. Viserys was Dany’s brother, but there wasn’t any particular love he had for his sister. He was always abusive and had on many occasions physically abused Dany. The only reason I think he did not sexually abuse her was because Dany’s virginity was his big ticket to achieve what he wanted. He sold his sister like cattle for his benefit. When Dany refused to marry Drogo he threaten her again. “ I will let his whole tribe fuck you, all 40,000 men and their horses if that’s it took” - these were his exact words. Even though Viserys was very abusive, Dany did love her brother. When the blood rider offered to kill Viserys in the forest for physically abusing Dany and threatening her with a sword, Dany stopped the blood rider and commands him not to harm her brother. But Viserys did cross the limit in Vaes Dothrak. For those who forgot the scene, Viserys threatens to cut Dany’s unborn baby from her womb. I am no woman, but from what I understand threatening a mother about killing her baby is kind of a dick move. And i assume every mother would react to that in the most violent way she can. How else did people expect Dany to react? How else did people expect the Khal to react when someone just threatened to kill his unborn baby? Why would anyone think Dany is mad for reacting the way she did when her husband killed the guy who just threatened to kill her baby? So in a way Viserys’s treatment of Dany was not very different from how Ramsay treated Sansa. So their reactions to the death of their abusers aren’t any different."},{"prompt":"What is the new income tax slab of 202122?","completion":"No changes in income tax slabs ,all are like that F.Y 2020–21 only."},{"prompt":"What is the best ayurvedic medicine for diabetes?","completion":"Guluchyadi Kashayam is an ayurvedic remedy traditionally used for treating diabetes.

I guess most people would refuse that, so for the restuarant that’s a loss: they can throw away the coffee, without being able to charge you for it. Of course, coke and coffee are very different. But what if instead of a coke, they brought you a Fanta?It’s still the same story. If you don’t like Fanta, you can refuse it and they cannot charge you for it. And with Pepsi/Coke, it’s still very much the same story, but even less desirable for a restaurant: with a Fanta, you could be seen as “accepting” the substitute product as soon as you took a sip, as it’s clear you got something different. With a Pepsi/Coke difference, however, the difference is less obvious, meaning you could drink half a glass and only then complain. And since it’s still something you didn’t order, there’s no ground on which the restaurant can argue you should pay for it. So, they simply ask if a substitute is okay."},{"prompt":"Who is the most inspiring superhero from the Marvel Cinematic Universe?","completion":"The most inspiring superhero from the Marvel cinematic Universe is Iron Man, he starts off the movies as a character that is hard to love.

Spend Time with Native Speakers you want to be taken seriously by native speakers when you speak, it is important to have conversations with them so you can begin to learn how they pronounce words and pace their conversations. Plus, as you develop relationships with native speakers, they will feel more comfortable pointing out when you mispronounce something or use an English word or phrase incorrectly.

We understand this can be difficult at first as you are beginning to learn the language and may get lost in the conversation. However, simply listening to people speak English is a great learning opportunity.

Here are some strategies for storing living room furniture in a small space: Multifunctional furniture: Opt for furniture pieces that serve multiple purposes. For example, consider a sofa bed that can be used for seating during the day and converted into a bed for guests at night. Look for ottomans with hidden storage compartments or coffee tables with shelves or drawers.Wall-mounted shelves and cabinets: Utilize vertical space by installing wall-mounted shelves or cabinets. These can hold books, decorative items, and other belongings, freeing up valuable floor space. Floating shelves are a popular choice as they don't take up much visual space.Utilize underutilized spaces: Explore the potential storage options in underutilized spaces. For instance, use the area under the sofa to store bins or boxes containing items you don't frequently use. Additionally, consider using the space above cabinets or on top of bookshelves for storage purposes.Modular furniture: Opt for modular furniture that can be easily rearranged or disassembled when needed. This allows you to customize the layout of your living room based on your current storage needs and available space.Use storage ottomans or benches: Incorporate storage ottomans or benches that can serve as extra seating while providing hidden storage inside. You can store blankets, pillows, or other items that are not in use.Slim or space-saving furniture: Look for furniture pieces with a slimmer profile or space-saving designs. For example, choose a narrower console table instead of a bulky entertainment center or select armless chairs or sofas to save on space.Utilize the walls: Install hooks, pegboards, or wall-mounted organizers to hang items such as hats, bags, or keys. This helps to keep these items easily accessible without taking up any floor space.Declutter and prioritize: Take the time to declutter and prioritize your belongings. Get rid of unnecessary items or furniture that you don't use or need. By minimizing the number of items in your living room, you can create more space for essential furniture pieces. Remember, efficient storage in a small living room is all about being creative, utilizing vertical space, and selecting furniture that serves multiple purposes. By employing these strategies, you can make the most of your available space while keeping your living room functional and organized."},{"prompt":"f a job is still being advertised 4 months after you were rejected, and you think you are qualified for it, would you reapply?","completion":"I understand how frustrating it can be to spend countless hours crafting proposals only to be rejected.

US District Judge Moxila Upadhyaya referred to Donald Trump as “Mr. Trump” and not “ Mr. President”.","completion":"He is NOT Mr. President. PRESIDENT BIDEN IS THE SITTING PRESIDENT! Trump was voted out of that office by the American people who were fed up with his low-class behavior! Why would anyone refer to him has such? Especially with the fact that he is a defendant who has been indicted four times! No other ex-president has created the level of criminal behavior he’s involved with or been indicted like that.

I am also a regular customer of their website, the quality of their products are satisfactory, and within the budget."},{"prompt":"Are there any anime studios who work to make good content without trying to pump out half finished or unfinished anime?","completion":"Yes, though my answer will be a little biased. The studio for these anime is Kyoto Animation. They’re legends in the anime industry (just like Madhouse). Unlike most studios like you implied in your question, Kyoto Animation takes their time creating content. And NEVER rushes their anime for the sake of “people pleasing” or following irrelevant trends like everyone else. Let’s take 2018 as an example (the year). Violet Evergarden was ONE of the anime they released that year. Along with: Liz to Aoi Tori (movie)Tsurune: Kazemai Koukou KyuudoubuFree!: Dive to the FutureChuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Movie: Take On Me That’s for the ENTIRE year of 2018. Roughly an anime every 2 months in 2018.A fair schedule when you compare it to other studios who seem to pump out anime every other week. When you look at Kyoani’s catalogue of anime, you’ll notice: The ratings are better than decent.They’re fairly popular.Respected for the “quality”.And 9/10 their anime becomes a favorite for the year (even if not the most popular). Using this picture again, you can see the consistency. All of these anime did well within the years they released. None of these anime were rushed or “thrown out” for the sake of it. Many are now classics (K-On, Haruhi, etc). The same is true for: Free!: Eternal Summer (2014)Hibike Euphonium (2015)A Silent Voice (2016)Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid (2017)Violet Evergarden (2018) Studio White Fox. They have a total of 40 anime to their name. Not a lot when compared to other studios. They’re smart. They tend to focus on a select amount of anime and then they develop those anime to make them more successful…. Instead of throwing out a bunch of shit for the sake of it. They’re known for: Akame Ga KillSteins GateThe Devil Is A Part TimerJormungandRe:ZeroGoblin SlayerIs The Order A RabbitCautious Hero Most of these shows have different versions or extended seasons. And make up the bulk of what they’ve produced or created. Quality, NOT quantity is their clear motto. And the success speaks for itself. Studio Trigger.Madhouse.P.A Works.J.C Staff. These studios are similar as well. Though Madhouse is an exception since they have MUCH more anime than the other studios (ignoring J.C Staff). And their anime are still solid. - Cheers [LINKED_TEXT: Kutaiba Alrefaai] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Kutaiba-Alrefaai]"},{"prompt":"What embitted the relations of India and China?","completion":"14 th Dalai Lama was given refugee in India -is one of the prime reason of bad relations between India and China. IMAGE: On March 17, 1959, the Dalai Lama left Lhasa in the dead of night under dramatic circumstances. He travelled with four of his Cabinet ministers, some attendants and bodyguards, and his family towards India . Tibetan temporal leader wrote to the Indian prime minister to seek refuge in India-Ever since Tibet went under the control of Red China and the Tibetan Government lost its powers in 1951, so upon receiving the message, Delhi took immediately measures to welcome him. Why he came to India? China invaded Tibet in around 1950-1951, and established a militaristic colony in the region. China wanted their resources. Following this the Chinese Army started treating the locals in the most inhumane way. Randomly arresting people off the streets, banning public gatherings arbitrarily - these became a very common day to day occurrence in Tibet. There were also several reports of military authorised rape and murders in Tibet.China also interfered in the cultural practices of the people of Tibet. Firstly, they wanted the people of Tibet to learn China’s history as the “national history.” They also wanted to impose Mandarin as the official language in the region.The Dalai Lama is not just mere religious leaders. They hold a lot of political influence as well. This certainly did not sit well with the Chinese authorities, and so, they tried arresting The 14th Dalai Lama. Once the Chinese authorities discovered that the Dalai Lama and his retinue had successfully crossed into India, they demanded that he be returned to China. At this point of time, India was recognising Tibet as an independent nation so India refused to do so thus lead to a future full of conflicts."},{"prompt":"What facts about Mumbai would people not believe unless they come to Mumbai?","completion":"There are many digital marketing courses available in Mumbai, and the best one for you will depend on your specific needs and goals.

Leasing offers a unique approach to vehicle ownership, providing certain benefits and considerations that may align with your lifestyle and financial goals. At Elite Auto Lease, we aim to shed light on whether leasing a car is a good idea, helping you make an informed choice that suits your needs. Pros of Leasing a Car Lower Monthly Payments: One of the primary advantages of leasing a car is the potential for lower monthly payments compared to purchasing. Since you're essentially paying for the vehicle's depreciation during the lease term, your payments can be more affordable.Access to Newer Models: Leasing allows you to drive a new car with the latest features and technologies more frequently. This is an appealing option for those who enjoy staying up-to-date with automotive advancements.Limited Repair Costs: Most lease terms coincide with the manufacturer's warranty, which covers many repair and maintenance expenses. This can lead to lower out-of-pocket costs during the lease period.Flexibility: Leasing provides flexibility at the end of the lease term. You can choose to return the vehicle, lease a new one, or even purchase the leased car if you've grown attached to it. Cons of Leasing a Car Mileage Restrictions: Leases often come with mileage limits. Exceeding these limits can result in additional charges, so it's important to consider your driving habits.No Ownership Equity: Unlike purchasing, leasing doesn't contribute to building equity in the vehicle. At the end of the lease, you don't own the car unless you choose to buy it.Cost Over Time: While monthly payments may be lower, leasing over an extended period could result in higher overall costs compared to purchasing. Is Leasing Right for You? Leasing a car can be a good idea if you prioritize lower monthly payments, enjoy driving new vehicles, and prefer not to worry about long-term ownership. It's an attractive option for those who want to experience the latest technology and avoid the responsibilities of long-term maintenance. However, if you value ownership equity, plan to keep a vehicle for an extended period, or anticipate high mileage, purchasing may be a more suitable choice. Conclusion The decision to lease a car is a personal one that depends on your individual preferences, financial situation, and driving habits. At Elite Auto Lease, we understand that every driver's needs are unique. Our team is here to provide expert guidance, transparent information, and a range of leasing options to help you determine whether leasing a car aligns with your goals.

Is this true?","completion":"I wish. First, all modern economies are a blend of socialism (social security, police, fire, schools, etc.) and market based forces working together. The question is where is the balance point that both allows the economy to grow and individuals to prosper and provides an opportunity for an acceptable lifestyle to all citizens and a safety net for those who aren’t able to achieve that goal.

Rapid weight loss can strain your body, leading to muscle loss, nutrient deficiencies, and a higher chance of regaining the weight later. Instead, gradual and sustainable weight loss should be the focus. Here are some tips for healthy weight loss: Seek professional advice: Before embarking on any[LINKED_TEXT: weight loss] [URL: https://www.digistore24.com/redir/502269/WAQAR184/502269] plan, it's crucial to consult with a doctor or a registered dietitian. They can ensure that your weight loss goals are realistic and safe based on your personal health needs. Balanced Diet: Prioritize a varied diet encompassing fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Minimize consumption of processed foods, sugary snacks, and high-calorie drinks. Portion Control: Pay attention to your serving sizes. Even nutritious foods can lead to weight gain if eaten in excessive amounts. Hydration: Ensure you drink ample water throughout the day. Thirst can often be confused with hunger, resulting in needless snacking. Regular Exercise: Include both cardiovascular activities such as walking, running or cycling, and strength training like weightlifting in your routine. Exercise is beneficial for burning calories, building muscle, and enhancing overall health. Steer clear of crash diets: These extreme diets or significantly low-calorie intakes can be detrimental to your health, causing muscle loss, fatigue, and nutrient deficiencies. Ensure adequate sleep: It's crucial to get enough quality sleep each night as sleep deprivation can disrupt your metabolism and result in weight gain. Manage stress effectively: High stress levels can trigger overeating or lead to unhealthy food choices. Discover healthy stress management strategies such as meditation, yoga, or engaging in hobbies you love. Monitor your progress: Maintain a food diary or utilize a weight loss app to track your dietary intake and exercise routines. Tracking can assist you in maintaining accountability and identifying areas that need improvement. Be Patient and Persistent: Sustainable weight loss requires time. Exercise patience with yourself and remain consistent in your healthy habits.

Something slightly more extreme can happen when I do something my dogs really don’t like (usually giving them a bath), where they’ll physically avoid me for a while after. This usually stops happening when I get to know my dog better and the dog learns that me doing those things doesn’t mean that I hate them, but their “cold shoulder” treatment is kind of funny!

If you allow answers that driven by non-arithmetic processes (like “The month in which the N’th US president was born” or “The number of letters in the N’th word of Webster’s Dictionary”) then you get even more ways to come up with answers.

If the grout is tight against the pipe coming out of the wall it helps to hold the pipe solid and take strain away from the shower connector in the wall. The problems occur when that connector takes all the strain and a pinhole leak starts spewing water into the wall cavity behind the tiles. Then eventually the entire wall is ruined, rotted out, and the shower needs a 8,000 plus gut out and rebuild. Probably more.

What sort of strange, dystopian hysteria is leading to this idea?So, how bad is the internet, or ubiquitous smartphones everywhere, or how bad is life in the real world . . . perhaps you may have never seen or experienced VR, which would make this question even more interesting, in that this bizarre gap between imagined hysteria and what’s really there is its own phenomena to make note of. VR is what you make of it. There are actually many practical and beneficial applications for it, and yes, there can be some rather dark or just plain ridiculous applications for it. Are you imagining civilization is going to suddenly become overtaken by VR zombies, perpetually adrift in imaginary worlds while the real world around them decays into morbid collapse, or perhaps the VR people are suddenly imbued with special powers that they use to control the world . . . or whatever? Well, maybe you’ve seen a few too many sci-fi movies or novels, but really, it’s not that big of a deal. I know, ever since the film “Ready Player One” came out, now there is a specific culture meme wrapped around this vision of the VR / metaverse world, some convinced that this is where humanity is heading . . . oh no!!! Well, try to calm down a bit, take a deep breath, the end of civilization as it’s currently known to be isn’t quite meeting its demise at the moment. Yes, it will become a popular new thing, maybe . . . I recall having worked on various VR projects since the mid 1990s, although now, of course, the VR interface tech is much more accessible, computers and graphics processors are vastly more powerful, and high speed networks can support 3D interactive content on a vast consumer scale, so it’s more likely to catch on this time around. Will there be some downsides to it, at least for some? Yes, probably, as is the case with just about anything else in the evolving tech world.

Vaping vs smoking • Vaping is not smoking. • Vape devices heat e-liquid, which usually contains nicotine, propylene glycol and/or glycerol, plus flavours, to create an aerosol that people breathe in. • The main difference between vaping and smoking tobacco is that vaping does not involve burning. Burning tobacco creates toxins that cause serious illness and death. • A vape device heats a liquid (often containing nicotine) to produce an aerosol (or a vapour) that can be inhaled. The vapour delivers nicotine to the user in a way that is relatively free of other chemicals. Non-smokers and vaping • If you don’t smoke, don’t vape. • If you’ve never smoked or used other tobacco products then don’t start vaping. • Vaping products are intended for people who smoke. Vaping and young people • Young people are experimenting with vaping, and those who try vaping are also those who are more likely to try smoking at a later time. However, it is not possible to say from current evidence that vaping causes people to smoke. • Smoking rates for both adults and young people are continuing to drop in New Zealand. There is no evidence that vaping is normalising smoking. • In New Zealand youth smoking rates continue to decline and daily use of vaping devices is rare and is largely confined to those who have smoked.

It’s very possible that the upper-limiting factors are either how much fuel and air they can gulp down and how fast, or the thermal and structural limits of the airframe itself. Drag and compressive resistance increase at a faster rate than ramjet efficiency, so if air and fuel and materials limitations were taken out of the equation, you could chart engine performance against drag and compression resistance, and at some point those arcs will intersect and additional thrust can not yield additional speed, and that is your theoretical limit*. In fact, Speed records of the SR-71 (and its even-faster A-12 ancestor) remain largely-classified, and theoretical limits are just that, theoretical. The CIA and USAF would not have been happy with jockey pilots hot-rodding around in expensive, irreplaceable, critical assets loaded with valuable and sensitive technology and data.

IF the female vampire is of good morals…and does NOT kill anyone, surviving from either “non-lethal” “donations” of blood…or from blood banks…I might be willing to do it with a vampire as well…but far more mermaids are compassionate and moral creatures than are vampires…so my odds are far better in finding a kind, compassionate, and moral mermaid than to find a vampire with those qualities…although they are not completely unknown…even among the “undead”!

I guess a 1:6 teacher to student ratio is pretty good, but are the teachers better at teaching or is it just something that the affluent can brag about?","completion":"I’ve written about this before: For those with the means (and I am very aware of the inequity here), private schools offer choice. If you want a religious education for your child, you can have that. If you are looking for a particular program, a flexible schedule because your child has other commitments (dedicated athlete, actor, model, etc.), or a certain type of education, you can find that in private schools. My 6–12 school has a learning skills program. About a third of our students need some kind of support—they have high-functioning autism, dyslexia, ADD or ADHD, for example—so they can attend our regular classes and get extra help during the school day. (That support costs extra, by the way.) In addition, we often get students who struggle with anxiety, or who have been bullied in their public schools. We’re a small school, we have specialized staff who can support those students while they still attend a regular (albeit private) high school. We can offer choice: My school also offers a couple of special dual-diploma programs, one in the arts for pre-professional students, and one based on learning and understanding about environment, politics, history, public policy, etc. for juniors and seniors. All seniors participate in a year-long seminar, studying a topic of their choice. Is every teacher better at teaching? I can’t say. What I can say is that we have the freedom to teach what we think is important, not what the state or school board tells us. Does that mean we teach all kinds of weird, off-beat things? No, but we’re often the first to adopt/create new courses that you would see five or 10 years later in the public schools. The other thing about teachers is that with a lighter student load, they have the time and space to get to know the students better than a public school teacher may have. We also have many roles in our school, by necessity, so we all see students in different arenas. Private schools are a community and teachers are a big part of that. For parents of middle schoolers, that’s particularly reassuring, as the leap from elementary to middle in public school is often a huge one. I’m sure that for some, private school means bragging rights, or future professional connections. But not all private schools are Ivy League pipelines. We offer choice, flexibility and a personal community. For many parents, those who can pay, and those who apply for financial aid, that’s what they want/need for their children."},{"prompt":"w can I download magazines for free on the Internet?","completion":"[LINKED_TEXT: Library Genesishttp://libgen.is] [URL: http://libgen.is/]"},{"prompt":"w do people who eat only once or twice a day manage to not feel hungry between meals?","completion":"By doing things that don’t involve obsessing about food.

When I planned my wedding, I actually took my maid of honor with me to the bridal shop because I wanted her to try styles that she liked and felt comfortable in. I did the actual picking, but if she had disliked the style I picked, I would have kept looking until I found something that would work. If any of my other bridesmaids disliked their dresses, I never heard about it. If someone really hated the dress I chose and refused to wear it, I guess one way to handle it would have been to go back to the bridal shop and pick a different style in the same color as the other girls’ dresses. My wedding was 22 years ago. When one of my cousins was married 6 years ago, his bride chose a few different dress styles in the same color for her bridesmaids, which I think is a great idea, because a dress that might look good on someone who is tall and thin might not look as good on someone shorter or curvier, etc. All the bridesmaids wore different dress styles (not radically different…some had spaghetti straps, some had wider straps, some were strapless, the skirts might have had different lengths) but they were all the same color and they were nicely coordinated…the girls all looked like they were part of the same wedding party. Not long after my own wedding, my husband was a groomsman at one of his friends’ weddings. The bride chose a beautiful dress for her bridesmaids that unfortunately would only have looked good on a person who was thin or at a correct weight. The dresses had partially open sides and were mostly open-backed with straps that crisscrossed in the back. Wherever there wasn’t material from the straps, there was skin. The dresses were also sleeveless and form fitting. With the exception of the bride’s sister, the bridesmaids were pouring out of their dresses, and not in a flattering way. Just as these dresses were designed to call attention to someone’s best physical attributes, they also called attention to problem areas. I was of the opinion that knowing the body types of her bridesmaids, the bride should have chosen a style that was more flattering and provided more coverage. I had the misfortune of overhearing one immature male guest say to his girlfriend as the bridesmaids walked down the aisle, “That girl does NOT have the body for that dress.” So, I would say that if a bridesmaid doesn’t like the dress you’ve chosen because she isn’t comfortable with the way it fits (maybe it accentuates a part of her body she isn’t comfortable with or doesn’t want to show), it would probably be a good idea to look at other styles. As far as the color of the dress goes, I don’t think the bride should have to bend on that one. Thank you again for the a2a. I hope my answer helps."},{"prompt":"Do you believe in karma? Why or why not?","completion":"Short answer: Yes. Long answer: Lets start with what is Karma. Karma are consequences of your actions traveling across space and time.In Indian philosophy, karma refers to both, your actions and consequences of your actions.It is neither good nor bad. You act in destructive manner, consequences are destructive. You act in constructive manner, consequences are constructive. Whatever you did and whatever the consequences both are karma. The statements such as “Karma is bitch”, “Karma is about to get you”, and many such statements with a sentiment of revenge, are inaccurate. Does everything happen because of Karma? Consider the following hypothetical example: You plant a seed. This is your action. Karma.The seed sprouts into a plant. This is consequence of your action. Karma.You nourish the plant and tend to it regularly. [Action = Karma]The plant eventually grows into a tree. [Consequence = Karma]It bears fruits, which humans, birds, animals consume, provides shade. [Consequence = Karma]. Good or Bad? You will answer good, as its doing good to someone else.It is now a dense tree. On a stormy weather, thunder and rain, one of its branches break, injures a person taking shelter under the tree. [Consequence = Karma]. Good or Bad? Additionally, it was action of the injured person to take shelter under the tree. It was that persons action [Action = Karma]. You get the point. Its a simple cause and effect relation. Both cause and effect referred to as Karma. Good and Bad are labels we provide depending on the perspective and the outcome. In the context of above example, your karma were good for the animals, birds and people that the tree fed and provided shelter.your karma were bad for the injured.BUT, it was also the injured persons karma who took shelter at the wrong place and wrong time. He would not know, it is the outcome that labeled the act of taking shelter as a wrong action. So YES Everything that happens is Karma. Everything happens because of Karma. —- If you liked the answer, please upvote.

Early Morning (around 2–3 a.m.): It's generally the time we tend to drift off to the sweet world of dreams. Having your friends next door and a more than 100mbps internet gives a huge advantage to Netflix and her brethren over us. Late night 'Ramu ki chai' is one of the pious daily deed which most of us follow religiously. Trust me this will be your sleeping time too, once you become a part! Around 8 a.m. : It's the time we realise we have our classes. Waking at almost 7:45 is like a dream come true for some of us, but mostly we do try to wake up at 7:30, a quick freshen up and we hurry to the ‘Himalayas', our mess, climb two floors grab the plate , serve ourselves some breakfast and boils the most important meal of the day is eaten. Then we pedal to our classes, yes pedal coz they are around a km away. And then classes continue till 12 noon. 'The Lunch Break' : The happily welcomed lunch break, by one and all, after around 4 hrs of classes it's like a little down spirits and a hungry mind, we pedal down to the Himalayas again and get ourselves served lunch, i.e. a predecided meal menu, available on apps (yes we have our own apps with menu), and after lunch some of us do sneak half an hour of rest before the remaining classes. But it's a miracle to wake up in half an hour for many! After lunch showdown: In these classes even our profs acknowledge our drowsy dropping heads with certain afternoon nap jokes to lift up the mood. Continuing with the classes, we eagerly await for the hour to end… *Now there are two divisions, labs and no labs Labs: When we have labs, we just go to our labs and experience the practical applications of learning, a true eye opener for us, some of the labs which I have attended till now; applied mechanics, physics, chemistry (all 3), strength of materials, fluids, cs etc. These labs are truly insightful except for a couple of lazy days. Personally it's a great learning opportunity! No Labs: This is a hard time for us to figure out, sometimes it's just working on a task at hand, sometimes it's just dead drop on the bed and dozing off to Neverland while others it's just a random match of pool or table tennis. If the classes end late, they are followed by 'Ramu ki chai’ and snacks. It's like the go to place in the campus… The real wake up call ( around 5 pm ): The campus starts bubbling with energy as the evening approaches, people with various sports equipments for tennis, badminton, cricket, football start going to various grounds, courts and tracks. Me personally it's either a football, basketball, tennis racquet or cricket bat along with rare badminton and table tennis… It's like a whole different vibe. Sports are encouraged and thus even we love play a lot. Most of the hostel grounds are filled with 'enthu junta' (insti slang), the enthusiastic people, shouting at the top of their voices with calls like pass kar, maarke dikha, aaja ab, marjaa, goaaaaaallll very common to be heard… Also the swimming pool is filled with a no. of people. Many people hit gym on a regular basis too.This is most of the evening we guys have!! Won't mention time now just the things, coz everything now is pure energy, passion, love and truly amazing. It's our lifeline in insti… After a quick shower and dinner, there are different groups of people who do differ things. Some of us might attend various sessions being arranged by different clubs while others hangout with friends at various spots. Saturday night is reserved for the movies at the OAT( OPEN AIR THEATRE) , yes we have it too!! These sessions are great for freshies and other junta alike. We often tend to have dinners at different places around the campus like at phoenix, kake da dhaba etc. Hanging and chilling at CCD is something very common among people . Late night movie screenings in TV rooms and 12 pm football are very common for a lot of people! Cycling around the campus for a bit, certain people among us do pick up books for a time, but most of us are last minute achievers, we only pick books before the exams. Futsal visits to grounds are a common ritual followed once a week by me and my friends. Other things like gossiping, having a juice at coolbiz, binge watching again are quite common.. The club culture comes to life literally at night when the center for innovation sparks as a day, with many minds and technical enthusiasts working on prototypes and ideas with a huge amount of effort. Been a part, it's a great feeling. That's it mostly, I did miss the leg pulling and the prank doing part will surely add later! That's a typical day at IIT MADRAS when the quizzes or endsems are not around :) Will surely add the pictures when I get to the campus, it's a new phone and quarantine sic.."},{"prompt":"My left eyelid has been twitching loads for the past month or more.

They just seldom interbreed, usually because of distance. But consider dogs. coyotes, and wolves. They can all interbreed with fertile offspring, yet are considered different species because they usually don’t. So they were never “distantly” related. Species that are distant enough not to have fertile hybrid offspring have no evolutionary pressure to mutate closer. Instead they may undergo convergent evolution to fill the same niche and become very similar, yet remain completely incompatible for interbreeding. For example, look at the wolf and the marsupial thylacine."},{"prompt":"w do I get someone's name by their mobile number?","completion":"1.

I know this because I watched his YouTube series “Best Shape of My Life.” In that series he is losing his COVID weight, as well as working on his memoir. The memoir entitled “Will” dives into the actors defining moments in his life — going far back to early childhood. “Mr. Nice Guy” has a surprisingly troubled past. I was surprised when I found out about it. He seems so perfect. Everybody loves Will Smith. Didn’t know that underneath that charm and charisma was pain. His father was physically and emotionally abusive towards his mother. Will the oldest son, felt helpless in those moments. He wanted to help his mother but couldn’t. He felt an enormous amount of guilt and shame because of this. My opinion, is that Will suffers from PTSD and he was triggered by his wife’s reaction to that joke. The hurt on her face, triggered him into a flashback of being a helpless child and seeing his mother unable to defend herself. He no longer is a helpless child, he is an adult with physical strength and is fully capable of defending his family. He did what he couldn’t do — as a child. Was it right? He probably went too far. He could of left it at yelling at Chris Rock from his seat. But hey — he’s human. In the moment he felt that was the right thing to do. Jada’s hair loss could also be more serious than we know. Reacting this way does not make him a bad person, it just makes him human. > Chris Rock will be okay. It was just a punch, that happened to be on live tv — on one of the biggest nights of television. The punch was not that bad, the only things hurt were egos. Chris Rock, put some ice on that. For those saying Will Smith should be locked up That is laughable. Locked up for a single punch? No he should not be locked up for that. Every man has been punched in the face at least once(right)? Y’all are blowing this way out of proportion. You are demonizing the man for having feelings and a painful past and punching someone. > Yes, he has an incredible amount of privledge to walk on stage, punch a man in his face and sit back down in his seat. Life is not fair, but it did make him look like a badass. He is going though a transition In his speech he mentioned he is going through a transition in his life. He didn’t have to say that for me to know. He has been though a lot publicly in the past few years. His transition probably started with him beginning his memoir or with the public humiliation he experienced from his wife’s “affair.” He said that he uncovered a lot of things in the process of writing his book. Things that he had blocked from his memory and old feelings resurfaced. He is living his truth. I have a feeling we are going to hear more about his new life's path.

HSL (a–d) and HSV (e–h). Above (a, e): cut-away 3D models of each. Below: two-dimensional plots showing two of a model's three parameters at once, holding the other constant: cylindrical shells (b, f) of constant saturation, in this case the outside surface of each cylinder; horizontal cross-sections (c, g) of constant HSL lightness or HSV value, in this case the slices halfway down each cylinder; and rectangular vertical cross-sections (d, h) of constant hue, in this case of hues 0° red and its complement 180° cyan. HSL (for hue, saturation, lightness ) and HSV (for hue, saturation, value ; also known as HSB , for hue, saturation, brightness ) are alternative representations of the RGB color model , designed in the 1970s by computer graphics researchers. In these models, colors of each hue are arranged in a radial slice, around a central axis of neutral colors which ranges from black at the bottom to white at the top. The HSL representation models the way different paints mix together to create color in the real world, with the lightness dimension resembling the varying amounts of black or white paint in the mixture (e.g. to create \\"light red\\", a red pigment can be mixed with white paint; this white paint corresponds to a high \\"lightness\\" value in the HSL representation). Fully saturated colors are placed around a circle at a lightness value of 1 ⁄ 2 , with a lightness value of 0 or 1 corresponding to fully black or white, respectively. Meanwhile, the HSV representation models how colors appear under light. The difference between HSL and HSV is that a color with maximum lightness in HSL is pure white, but a color with maximum value/brightness in HSV is analogous to shining a white light on a colored object (e.g. shining a bright white light on a red object causes the object to still appear red, just brighter and more intense, while shining a dim light on a red object causes the object to appear darker and less bright). The issue with both HSV and HSL is that these approaches do not effectively separate color into their three value components according to human perception of color. [1] [2] [3] This can be seen when the saturation settings are altered – it is quite easy to notice the difference in perceptual lightness despite the \\"V\\" or \\"L\\" setting being fixed. Basic principle [ edit ] HSL and HSV are both cylindrical geometries ( fig. 2 ), with hue, their angular dimension, starting at the red primary at 0°, passing through the green primary at 120° and the blue primary at 240°, and then wrapping back to red at 360°. In each geometry, the central vertical axis comprises the neutral , achromatic , or gray colors ranging, from top to bottom, white at lightness 1 (value 1) to black at lightness 0 (value 0). In both geometries, the additive primary and secondary colors – red, yellow , green, cyan , blue and magenta – and linear mixtures between adjacent pairs of them, sometimes called pure chttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV]"},{"prompt":"Why did JFK have affairs?","completion":"You have to realize that Jackie was a low-life slut.

I would usually get a small breakfast or maybe just a coffee. I would usually end up spending a lot of time sitting there either reading or writing. I usually sat in the same area every time I went in, if not my favorite corner booth. There was a waitress about my age maybe a few years older who had recently started working there and usually had the section that I sat in. I worked but had no real bills to speak of seeing that I was still living at home. It was common for me to leave a 5 - 10 tip depending on how long I had been there. One night I went in about my usual time 12.30am and had a small breakfast and a never ending cup of coffee. By this time the waitress and myself became friends I'll call her Anna. I had stayed through the bar rush, I always laughed how Anna would handle the drunk guys flirting with her. When I left I realized that I had brought just enough to cover the check, and could not leave a tip. I felt horrible and told Anna that I would make it up to her. The next time I was in there maybe a week later I had parked to where I could see the area I was going to sit but unless someone (from the restaurant) was really looking wouldn't see me. I went in ordered just coffee maybe 2 and of course it was Anna who was my waitress that night (by this time the manager would tease us saying how we were secretly dating (I only wish)). Upon leaving I had done my usual and left my tip folded up just to mess with Anna as she had the habit of straightening and facing the bills all in the same direction as she would put them into her tip book. I on purposely left while she was back in the kitchen and not paying attention to me leaving. Sitting in my pickup I watched as she returned to my table to retrieve her tip and wipe down the table. As I watched her unfold the bills and saw her eyes go wide and the words oh my God cross her lips (I don't read lips but it was obvious.) I had left a 50 bill wrapped inside a couple of 1's. The next time I went in I barely had a chance to look around when I saw a short blonde haired person come flying at me. She had moved out on her own and sharing an apartment with a friend, her rent took just about all of her pay while she went to the local college. After she let me go she thanked me for her new work shoes. We stayed friends for a few more months till I left for Marine Corps Boot Camp. That just happens to be the most memorable for me but far from being the largest tip I have left. After I got out of the Marine Corps I started work in the casino business and relied heavily on tips as the main staple of my income. I find tipping to be very important and will always tip generously if the wait staff had made an effort to make my meal enjoyable. I have also been known on occasion to tip the kitchen staff if my meal was particularly well prepared.

The local hospital administered basic first aid, but nothing else and the injured returned home to die, unable to afford the cost of treatment. Since last six years wearing a saffron kurta (shirt) that says “Mobile medicine bank for poor patients”, Omkar starts every day at 6 am from his rented home in the Mangalapuri slums and goes door to door in different areas of Delhi asking for unused medicines, which he then distributes to charitable hospitals, NGOs and clinics. Crippled at the age of 12 in a car accident, Omkar walks five or six kilometres per day. He cannot afford the metro rail fare, so travels by buses with the help of his senior citizen pass. In remote areas where buses do not ply, he simply walks.

Vijay Lakshmi Sharma Vijaylaxmi is only 24 years old but is an inspiration to many young girls in her village of Jhodinda, Rajasthan, where child marriage is common. She defied this age-old tradition and decided to follow her aspirations to go to college and live life the way she wanted. Convincing her parents was the biggest struggle. On her 13th birthday, Vijaylaxmi’s mother decided it was time for her daughter to get married. Vijaylaxmi protested, voicing her desire to study more and to get married at a later age. This decision did not go down well with her family. In response, they locked poor Vijaylaxmi up without any food or water for several days. As time passed by, the relationship remained strained. Vijaylaxmi’s parents were ridiculed for having an unmarried daughter and she was often shunned within her community. Then came a turn of events- a neighbour’s 14-year-old married daughter tragically died during childbirth. Shocked and with their eyes now open to the dangers of child marriage, her parents began to understand Vijaylaxmi’s defiance and to support their daughter’s decision.

Keep in mind that State Troopers are literally the last type of LEO’s in America that you’d want to be pulled over for any reason let alone going 100+mph. The first time was in September of 2018, it was after 6am in the morning and I was in my way home from work after working a 16 hour shift. As I was going…well speeding down the interstate, I see a State Trooper behind me with his lights flashing so I pull over. As he walks up to my car he asks me “Any excuse why you were going 103 in a 70?” and I reply with just a “No” as I hand him my DL. Mind you I was wearing my CO uniform during all of this. After about 10 minutes goes by, he comes back and says that he could have cited me for reckless driving but decided not to. Thank goodness for that. The vibe I got from him was that he seemed to be kind of a dick and he may very well not like Correctional Officers. The training academy’s for troopers and corrections officers are both in Selma, AL and their training buildings are on the same state property so we’d see each other every day and they (perhaps not all) tend to look down on the ADOC. Correctional officers are often viewed as the red headed step children of law enforcement in America. All in all I could really care less as most troopers (and police officers) wouldn’t even have the courage to step foot inside a prison but I digress. So the trooper let me know that my court date would be October of next month but I could pay online within 48 hours. Obviously I was going to pay online and not waste my time having to go to court. Well 48 hours comes around and nothing. I could not find my ticket anywhere on the website when I typed in my case number. Ohh well I thought. I simply wait another 24 hours. Still nothing showed up as I typed my case number from the ticket in. I wasn’t really in panic mode but I couldn’t figure out why it wasn’t appearing online. So basically every day until my court date I would check and nothing would appear. “Is this guy being a jerk and wanting me to have to show up in court?” I thought to myself. I was not happy about it at all but I was totally powerless to do anything about it. My court date finally had arrived and I was all dressed up for my appearance along with several dozen others that day. Even some county jail inmates were over to the side. None of them seemed to recognize me from work. It would have been kind of embarrassing if they did. I was initially seated towards the back of the room and I simply waited my turn to be heard. The judge was a older middle aged woman and I got a good vibe from her. One thing I can distinctly remember is that she was automatically throwing out tickets from particular areas that she considered to be speed traps. Well as it was my turn to walk up I told her my situation and she directed my over to her right which was a bailiff (a man appearing to be over the age of 65) and what appeared to be an assistant district attorney. I told them my name and they couldn’t find it anywhere on the list. I showed them my ticket and told them my situation and the bailiff told me that it was likely that the trooper wasn’t doing his job properly. Well I’ll be dammed, none of these people weren’t even expecting me today. So the bailiff informed me that he would have the ticket thrown out and it would reflect on my driving record. I told them thank you and went on my way. That saved me from having to pay a lot of money. The second time was just a few weeks after my ticket from September of 2018 had been thrown out of court. I just thought to myself that I was a dummy and I was going to have to pay up this time. Here we go again. Same question, “Any reason why you were doing 103 in a 70?” I said “No”. I was in my CO uniform again. Well after a brief talking to, this time the trooper let me off with a warning. He seemed to be a bit of a nicer fellow. I just thought to myself, I can’t believe what is happening right now. I have dodged two bullets that would have cost me several hundred dollars and would have drove my insurance sky high. Since then I haven’t been pulled over for speeding at all. While I’d be lying if I said I haven’t sped since then, I’ve become a lot more cautious. In the USA, you would almost have a better chance of winning the lottery than you would getting pulled over twice by a State Trooper, let alone within two months, for driving 100+ mph and not having to pay a ticket for either one.

She’s the one who will need to take significant time away from her career for pregnancy leave, maternal leave, and for however long she wants to prioritize raising the child over work. She’s the one who will have to do it all alone if the relationship ends for any reason. So legally, the choice should be 100% hers, and nobody else’s. If she’s safe and secure in her relationship and her career, and has no serious health implications to worry about from pregnancy, then it’s best to get her husband on board and on the same team.

The enneagram is based on ancient wisdom and is one of the most popular systems used by personality buffs on the internet. Like almost all typologies (including scientific ones like Big 5 and HEXACO) it has lacked an evolutionary perspective. Nario and Krüger have endeavoured to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the nine enneagram types using fictitious examples of stone age types and modern neuroscience and genetics. So, when I saw the book online I didn’t hesitate a moment to get it for my Kindle library. I did love the basic idea of investigating the nine types from an evolutionary point of view and connecting the picture to recent research in genetics (genome-wide association studies) and neuroscience. However, the authors are too eager to connect everything and miss the many details and problems that their approach brings. To begin with, there is almost no social differentiation in foragers (hunter-gatherers) to warrant the idea that cavemen had nine different personality types. There is some minor division between men and women, hunting vs gathering, and even this division is not very strict as women are actively involved in hunting as well as men in foraging. The only distinct role in foragers are shamans, but they are far from being universal and the Hadza, for example, lack shamans. Many of the nine roles would simply not work for egalitarian hunter-gatherer bands. The authors often lack detailed knowledge of foragers, e.g. describing their bands as “clans”, which is a serious miscategorization of foragers social organization. Clans are often at war with each other, foragers have a flexible split and join pattern regarding foreign bands. Enneagram type 8, “the challenger” or “the warrior” as the authors call it, does not fit anywhere into egalitarian forager organisations that have no permanent leadership. Leadership is temporary and based on competence, rather than a challenging personality type. Likewise, the authors assign the most ambitious type, 3 “The Achiever” (called “The Hunter” in the book) to the most successful hunters. According to the authors “Hunters” are driven by testosterone, have a sense of self-confidence, exaggerated optimism, decreased levels of fear and empathy, increased impulsiveness and risk-taking, and a tendency to assume one’s own opinion is correct while ignoring other opinions. While hunters are certainly higher in testosterone than gatherers, some of these traits would actually be detrimental to real hunter-gatherers who hunt in groups, frequently make hypotheses about possible trajectories of their prey and consult each other and rarely act impulsively. The last thing a hunter would do is boast about his success, they do the opposite, downplaying it which is called “shaming the meat” and a part of hunter-gatherer egalitarianism. This is what authors get when they don’t do their homework properly. A hunter is more likely a 5 (an Investigator or a “Tracker” aka “Hunter”) than a 3 (a Goalgetter) on the enneagram. The work of hunters is much more similar to detective work than hardcore action. I guess this is the reason why we 5s are so into scavenger hunts or finding easter eggs in video games. Foragers don’t kill dangerous animals like lions, at least not if they have a choice. Two enneagram types, 4s and 5s, called “Wizards” and “Sages”, respectively in the book, are hard to justify from an evolutionary point of view, as both types tend to be loners. They might be the closest thing to a shaman, but a 4 who feels painfully different from his peers so that she needs to go against the grain and a 5 who loves to overthink in his cave instead of going hunting simply would have found it difficult to survive and reproduce. To summarize, here are some of the main problems with the book and assigning evolutionary profiles to enneagram types: No scientific model yields anywhere near nine factors for personality (two to six)Our hunter-gatherer ancestors had very little differentiation when it comes to social rolesThe authors have little inside knowledge of foragers and present a general caveman kind of prehistory and very general ideas of what hunting is likeMany of the roles the authors assign just would not work for egalitarian hunter-gatherersSome of the roles they discuss would not have been viable from an evolutionary perspective (i.e. 4 and 5). What I agree with the authors is their evolutionary approach to personality. Scientists generally find five or six factors (which can be considered roles, or rather the maximum values for each evolutionary profile). However, this is only true in complex societies. In subsistence societies, they typically only find two different factors, e.g. in farmers a conscientious and hard-working profile and a more social and caregiving profile. In Evolutionary Psychology these profiles are called providing and caregiving. A possible evolutionary model based on subsistence strategies would therefore look like this We, therefore, arrive at six evolutionary profiles, each assigned to a maximum value in the HEXACO model (e.g. provisioning pastoralist = highest in extraversion/risk-taking). We could add complex (sedentary) hunter-gatherers compared to nomadic foragers (NJ vs NP) and extraversion/introversion to our model and would get the 16 profiles of MBTI. If we now compare our evolutionary model with the distribution of MBTI types in the enneagram we find some interesting patterns. The distribution for type 3 resembles the distribution of MBTI types most closely and is therefore rather neutral. 1,2 and 6 are totally dominated by SJ (farmer) types. These roles are quite relatable when you picture that ancient farmers had to work hard, slowly improve their farming methods, and generally have high levels of cooperativity and conformity. Nario and Krüger label type 6 (the Loyalist) “the Guardian (the same label Keirsey used for the SJ temperament). This is probably the most common enneagram type and does not represent the forager who keeps watch over the bonfire so much as the farmer who keeps watch over the granary and his property to protect it from being pillaged. Foragers don’t have special guards, they frequently wake during the night, so that at any one point always one member of the band is awake. The last three enneagram types are firmly held by herder types (who make up around 30% of the general population). Explorer, Challenger and Peacekeeper are roles that make sense in nomadic or semi-nomadic pastoralist societies that tend to have the highest levels of violence. Peacekeepers are less needed in a conformist farmer society, hence the almost total absence of SJ types. The same is true for Explorers (7s) and Challengers (8s). On the flip side, there are almost no herder 1s or 2s. Farmers and herders lived in very different kinds of worlds, the former seeking stability, the latter adventure. As we can see, farmer world and herder world are almost complementary. It’s the hunter-gatherer types who need to find their purpose in life and fit in. This leaves a lot of hunters with the 5 role (3x overrepresented) and a lot of gatherers (a whopping 50%, almost 5x overrepresented) in the 4 position. Hunters also often side with the farmers in becoming 1s or 3s or with herders in becoming rebels (8s). Gatherers, on the other hand, frequently side with farmers as 2s (Helpers) or with herders as 9s (Peacekeepers). We got a clear farmer world (1,2,6) and a clear herder world (7,8,9) with people who don’t easily fit in occupying 4 and 5 and all the niches in between. My conclusion: the enneagram is unlikely to represent any evolutionary evolved personality profiles. It’s the product of evolved preferences, culture and personal experiences. People aren’t born with an enneagram type like they are born introverts or extroverts. The enneagram shows life trajectories and my hunch is that people can change their enneagram type across their lifespan, whereas introverts hardly can become real extroverts. Nine Sapiens is still a book worth reading, especially for people interested in the enneagram. It’s important to keep in mind that the authors aren’t always dealing with our forager ancestors, though.

The aspect under scrutiny must furnish some type of pattern. This must be repeatable and quantifiable to be testable with certain rigour. This also ensures the claim has some objective reality, it is subject to the independent scrutiny of others in different forms and expressions. From this pattern, at least one prediction must be made from which the prediction is sought. It must be quantifiable and repeatable. From here, a tentative ‘law of nature' is proposed and further subjected to observation and test. A ‘law' cannot be proved correct, only incorrect. Scientific propositions must be falsifiable. Revision and revolution of thought are welcome, adjusting and integrating with grander schemes of understanding as nature provides new revelations. The context and limitations of application need to be established. The only exemption from this I can think of is the ‘Big Bang' in the creation of the universe. Certainly the evidence suggests this ‘event' with Hubble's law, the Cosmic Microwave Background and the hydrogen to helium ratio seen in the observable universe however this ‘event' (thank God) appears to be beyond our capacity to repeat it. To me, this is science. Much of Psychology and Sociology seeks patterns however human endeavor's are too complex and inextricably interwoven and entangled with chaotic (in the mathematical sense) responses that the uncertainties prevent or make at best uncertain predictions which may often fail. This cannot happen in strict science. We need to be certain of aerodynamics and the classical laws of physics together with a fundamental knowledge of electronics and materials before embarking on a flight or entering the surgeon's operating table. Premises in the social sciences are often more heuristic or empirical in the sense that their adoption is far from the rigorous demand that their suggestion is repeatable and precisely quantifiable. So in this sense I do not see social science as an apt name. Social studies or social behaviour is perhaps closer to a clear description of this discipline."},{"prompt":"w do I get back the rights for my book from a selfpublishing/vanity publishing company like AuthorHouse?","completion":"Depending upon the contract, you could have a fight on your hands.

Without any of the switches, the dir command prints out the file names, dates, times, and sizes, along with the names of any subdirectories. * The /b switch (dir /b) strips away all excess information, displaying only the name of the folders and files in the current directory and not attributes like file size and time stamps. * The /s switch (dir /s) show all files and folders inside the current directory.

However, some of the shrewdest, smartest maneuvers that I've seen in business involve creating a niche market, developing repeat customers and cultivating a loyal customer base. Here are a few examples: 1. Create a niche market - By focusing your business on a specific niche market, you can create a more loyal customer base that is more likely to stay with you through thick and thin. This can be especially beneficial if you're selling a product or service that is difficult to find elsewhere. 2. Develop repeat customers - Once you've built up a small but loyal customer base, it's important to keep them satisfied. This means offering them superior products or services at an affordable price, while also being attentive and responsive to their needs. 3. Cultivate a positive relationship with your customers - Treat your customers well and they will probably return the favor by promoting your business and recommending it to their friends and family members. This goes a long way in building trust and credibility - two key ingredients for success in any industry!"},{"prompt":"What's your single best piece of advice for anyone?","completion":"\\"The only way to do great work is to love what you do\\". It implies that passion is a critical component of success. When we are passionate about our work, we are more motivated, persistent, and committed to achieving our goals. This passion fuels us through the challenges and setbacks that inevitably arise along the way.

SUSHANT was an actor!!!! Stars like Salman Khan and Shahrukh Khan do same things in all the films. They will walk, talk, laugh, eat, speak, look as they do in their real lives. These people never follow the demand of the character in a film, they do the same thing in every film. People like the way Shahrukh spread his arms or stutter while speaking a line and he will do this in every film, no matter his character is a cop or a thief. But Sushant is an actor. He started as a background dancer, then he did TV and then films. He worked with director Abhishek Kapoor in his first film as Ishan, an emotional, hardworking and a little stubborn boy who refuses even the financial help of his father. In M.S. Dhoni, Sushant did a wonderful job. He was so much inside the skin of the character that people felt that they are watching the real Dhoni on the big screen. Remember, Dhoni is a popular personality and everyone has seen him several times and thus adopting his body language on the big screen was a real challenge but Sushant did it successfully. Without a second thought, in terms of acting skill, Sushant is better to Salman Khan."},{"prompt":"w do I make group calls in WhatsApp?","completion":"There are many solutions for How do I make group calls in WhatsApp Well, I was going to tell if you need to have this one, you can easily acquire this the end for yourself.

If you are eating a regular ole meal, you would still want something high in protein with medium carbs. That being said, you CAN get away with not eating anything at all. But a) you may not have the energy you need to get the proper intensity in your workout, and b) in the morning, your body is already in starvation mode and asking so much of your body can put you in a catabolic state i.e. or in simple terms, the environment in your body will NOT be supportive of muscle growth.

Cutting taxes for big business and the 1% while continuing to feed a bloated and insatiable military-industrial complex. Those people couldn't care less about either the deficits or the debt. They stayed mum while Trump added nearly SEVEN TRILLION to the debt in a single term."},{"prompt":"Why is the United States so much against the EU? It seems that the current US administration wants to see an end to the EU.","completion":"Trump believes in Nationalism. Patriotic duty and love for ones own country. Self determination and the God given right of a people to make its own decisions. He sees the EU as an overreaching entity forcing it views on the populations of Europe. He sees that the people of these nations dont really have a say in there own future. People they didnt vote for, who arent from there country, making decisions for them. They can decide who they send from there little region of their country but thats it. There is something in that that is inherently offensive to the American spirit. We would never let our fate be decided by other countries or entities. Also there is what we see as a negative influence on the West coming out of the EU. A sort of extreme left wing global socialism. Some of the stronger EU nations are pushing a globalist world view on the others. The forced admittance of unscreened migrants and their cultures. The lack of will to regulate or even criticize parts of those cultures that are incompatible with western values. The covering up of crimes by those migrants. Along with the EUs moral inconsistency and hypocrisy. EU citizens get arrested for saying mean words online. Misgendering is a crime. Its governments actively chastise it native citizens on tv, and in movies and advertisements about things like toxic masculinity, lad culture, rape culture, diversity, bigotry, racism, religious tolerance, acceptance of homosexuality and transexuals and a myriad of other “serious\\" issues. Yet allow Muslim no go zones to be set up, sharia police to patrol the streets, forced hijabs in Muslim areas, child brides, assaults of gays and trans, harassment of jewish, Buddhists, and christians at prayer, while also blaming native citizens when sexually assaulted bc they were to revealing in front of men from a different cultures. And what he and many Americans probably see as the biggest problems with the EU is its demonization of its own people for pointing out these problems, and in some cases criminalization, like Tommy Robinson. And worst of all its willingness to see each of it nations individual cultures disappear in favor of globalism. America has already seen some of these concepts which originated in the EU organically migrate to the US. While at the same time having to deal with people like Macron Merkel May etc. openly promoting them to our people. Which has worked to some extent, having gained some traction with a small but very active portion of our society. That is not okay to Trump or the majority of Americans. It is seen as a threat. We believe the social policies enacted by the EU have already caused irreparable harm to your ancient cultures, and if allowed to continue on this path will effectively erase them from everywhere but the history books(until liberals get of hold of them and paint each culture as a violent racist blight on mankind that we are good to be rid of). We dont want to see that happen to you, and we wont let that happen to us. So Trump with the mandate of the American people will work to weaken the EUs control of its member states. Not to break it up, but so each nation can decide its own cultural and social destiny without the interference of Hydra I mean Germany I mean the EU."},{"prompt":"Who are some of the big hearted citizens of India?","completion":"This 103-year-old woman from Karnataka has grown 384 banyan trees. She is not a book-inspired environmentalist. She did not go to school or get any formal education. She worked as a labourer and like most voiceless Indian women, took life head-on for survival. Thimmakka was born in the Hulikal village in the Magadi taluk of Bangalore Rural district. After doing back-breaking work from dawn to dusk through her childhood, she was married off to Bekal Chikkayya, a cattle herder. The couple were unable to conceive even after 25 years of their marriage, and decided to plant trees and raise them instead. Banyan trees were aplenty near Thimmakka’s village. Thimakka and her husband started grafting saplings from these trees. Ten saplings were grafted in the first year and they were planted along a distance of 4 kilometers near the neighbouring village of Kudoor. Fifteen saplings were planted in the second year and 20 in the third year. She used her own meager resources for planting these trees. The couple used to carry four pails of water for a distance of four kilometers to water the saplings. They were also protected from grazing cattle by fencing them with thorny shrubs. Her husband Chikkayya passed away in 1991. His memories, however, continue to grow and flourish. The saplings they planted together over 50 years ago, majestically line the five-km stretch from Kudur to Hulikal, under the shade of which Thimmakka relaxes and muses. Out of respect for her phenomenal work, locals call her ‘Saalumarada’, meaning row of trees in Kannada. Saalumarada Thimmakka was relatively unknown, until she received the National Citizens Award in 1996. In 2016, Saalumarada Thimmakka was listed by British Broadcasting Corporation as one of the most influential and inspirational women of the world. Trees planted by Salumarada Thimmakka along SH94 from Hulikal to Kuduru village. IT IS NICE TO POST THIS ANSWER ON WORLD EARTH DAY… Thanks folks. This is my first answer with 200 upvotes.

Bitcoin alone can handle more than 10,400 transactions per hour, and unlike a stock exchange, cryptocurrency trading is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week — so associated fees can quickly add up. In addition to the volume of cryptocurrency trading, fees vary greatly and currently have no cap. The daily average cost of a Bitcoin transaction has ranged from 1.17 to 10.65 over the last year, before skyrocketing to over 63 in April 2021. How Much Do Crypto Fees Cost? Depending on whether you're a maker (buyer) or taker, most cryptocurrency exchanges charge between 0% and 1.5% per trade (seller). Fees vary depending on the exchange. You'll never be able to completely avoid cryptocurrency transaction fees, but you can use services with lower fee structures. If you trade frequently in the cryptocurrency market, these fees can quickly add up. Robinhood, eToro, ShakePay, and BlockFi are all fee-free options. For both Makers and Takers, exchanges such as BitMEX and FTX charge transaction fees of less than 0.1%. However, as previously stated, every trading service will profit from your cryptocurrency orders. In some cases, the difference between the cheapest and most expensive options was as much as 2%, while in others, it was as small as a rounding error."},{"prompt":"What is the color code for 52M ohm?","completion":"5.2 is not one of the standard resistor values.

The fifth head of Brahmaji was speaking downgrades of Vedas.That Trident of Lord Shiva beheaded the same from the body of Brahmaji.

It sort of is, and with all addictions, you need to 1) get the alcohol or drugs out of the house and out of sight, even if it means temporarily not seeing friends or family members who can trigger you into relapse, 2) detox, 3) therapy or a support group. You need to talk to people who can shed perspective into this. Your head is full of lies and you need to sort out reality from the fiction the narcissist left in your head. It will take a long time, I will not lie, but it does get better, until one day you realize that the entire relationship felt like you were drugged, and now things make sense.

Imagine where two identical ships are constructed (same atomic composition in each plank or iron nail used) and both of them are kept under exactly same identical physical condition (temp, pressure, humidity etc.) for years. So that if deterioration occurs it occurs to both ships at same level. Now if one replace plank to plank or any component in Ship of Theseus. This way the original Ship of Theseus will remain Ship of Theseus forever. If I am born as twins and both of us share same DNA (foolish to even imagine), I can exchange each organ in me with my twin and I will remain as me forever. This wouldn't be cool though. P.S- Constructing such ship with available technology is not possible.

Are Macedonians Greek (not North Macedonia)?","completion":"I’ve answered similar questions, one can check them for details but here it is again. Ancient Macedonia was a part of Greece, at least politically and ethnically. As Strabo (64 BC- 24 BC) wrote in his book Geography: Macedonia, of course, is a part of Greece, yet now, since I am following the nature and shape of the places geographically, I have decided to classify it apart from the rest of Greece and to join it with that part of Thrace which borders on it and extends as far as the mouth of the Euxine In another passage Strabo says that north of the Aegean it’s still Greece and he describes this part as Macedonia: The Aegaean Sea washes Greece on two sides: first, the side that faces towards the east and stretches from Sunium, towards the north as far as the Thermaean Gulf and Thessaloniceia, a Macedonian city, which at the present time is more populous than any of the rest; and secondly, the side that faces towards the south, I mean the Macedonian country, extending from Thessaloniceia as far as the Strymon. Some, however, also assign to Macedonia the country that extends from the Strymon as far as the Nestus River, since Philip was so specially interested in these districts that he appropriated them to himself This is in line with what Xenophon reported from around 400 BC when an ambassador is describing a war between Olynthus and other states in the region: a great danger is springing up in Greece. To be sure, almost all of you know that Olynthus is the largest of the cities on the coast of Thrace. These Olynthians, in the first place, attached to themselves some of the cities with the provision that all should live under the same laws and be fellow-citizens, and then they took over some of the larger cities also. After this they undertook, further, to free the cities of Macedonia from Amyntas, king of the Macedonians. And when the nearest of them gave their allegiance, they speedily proceeded against those which were farther away and larger; and we left them already in possession of a great number of Macedonian cities, including especially Pella So, Macedonia and the part of Thrace that had Greek states is called Greece because politically that’s what it was. Not in the modern sense of nation-states but as the collection of Greek states. Arrian in his “Anabasis of Alexander” mentions a letter Alexander wrote when he started his camapign against the Persian campaign: Alexander wrote a reply, and sent Thersippus with the men who had come from Darius, with instructions to give the letter to Darius, but not to converse about anything. Alexander’s letter ran thus: “Your ancestors came into Macedonia and the rest of Greece and treated us ill, without any previous injury from us. I, having been appointed commander-in-chief of the Greeks, and wishing to take revenge on the Persians, crossed over into Asia And then, after the Battle of Granicus Arrian writes: prisoners he bound in fetters and sent them away to Macedonia to till the soil, because, though they were Greeks, they were fighting against Greece on behalf of the foreigners in opposition to the decrees which the Greeks had made in their federal council. The battle was fought in Anatolia, yet because the Persians and their Greek mercenaries were fighting against Alexander and the council of Corinth they essentially fought against Greece. As for modern Macedonians from Macedonia, not “North Macedonia”, they are of course Greeks as it’s a province of Greece, a country greatly homogeneous ethnically. Of course, alongside the hundreds of thousands of Greek Macedonians up to the 1920s there were Bulgarian and Turkish populations in the region but they were exchanged with Greeks under the treaties of Neilly and Lausane respectively. I’ve lived several years in Macedonia and all the locals I met were Greek, although to be honest I didn’t spend much time at the border villages next to North Macedonia where there are some few Slavic Makedonski. As far as I know these too have mized a lot as I’ve met a girl whose grandma from a village of Florina was Slavic Macedonian but the other grandma and both grandparent were Greek speaking, well, Greeeks. In any case, that’s an exception because it was a brief walk from North Macedonia. A few thousands in some villages are a tiny minority compared to the more than 2 milions of Macedonin Greeks. If one wishes to check, it is always a nice place to visit any time of the year. One can go to the stadium and listen to how people swear. Or some cafe, some bar and listen to the chats.

In this discussion, we will explore various aspects of investing in cryptocurrencies to help you make an informed decision. Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many others, have gained significant attention over the past decade. They offer an alternative to traditional financial systems and promise decentralization, security, and potential for high returns. However, these digital assets come with unique challenges that should be carefully considered. First and foremost, the cryptocurrency market is highly speculative and volatile. Prices can fluctuate dramatically in short periods, leading to substantial gains or losses. It is not uncommon to witness rapid price swings, which can be both exciting and unnerving for investors. [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #nSCNt] One of the key drivers of cryptocurrency prices is market sentiment, which can be influenced by news, regulatory developments, or technological advancements. Therefore, understanding the underlying factors impacting the market is crucial in managing your investments effectively. Another consideration is the lack of regulation in the cryptocurrency space. While some countries have implemented regulatory frameworks, many are still developing their approach. This absence of regulation can lead to potential risks, such as scams, fraud, and market manipulation. As an investor, it's essential to exercise caution and conduct thorough research before participating in any investment opportunities. Despite the risks, some proponents argue that cryptocurrencies offer diversification benefits to traditional investment portfolios. Historically, cryptocurrencies have shown a low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds, which means they may provide an additional hedge against economic downturns. Moreover, blockchain technology, which underlies most cryptocurrencies, has shown potential in various industries beyond finance, such as supply chain management, healthcare, and voting systems. Investing in cryptocurrencies can be seen as a way to support and participate in the development of these technologies. The rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has also brought new opportunities to the cryptocurrency space. DeFi platforms enable individuals to access financial services without intermediaries, while NFTs allow for unique ownership of digital assets. These innovations have attracted considerable interest and investment in recent times. Diversification, technological potential, and the excitement of cutting-edge developments aside, investing in cryptocurrencies carries inherent risks. As a relatively new and evolving asset class, their long-term sustainability is uncertain. Market sentiment and regulatory changes can lead to abrupt price movements, impacting even the most established cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, the cryptocurrency ecosystem faces technical challenges, such as scalability and security issues. Blockchain networks need to address these concerns to ensure broader adoption and stability. In light of these considerations, it is crucial to approach cryptocurrency investing with a balanced perspective. Only invest what you can afford to lose and be prepared for a bumpy ride. To mitigate risks, consider diversifying your investment across multiple cryptocurrencies and traditional assets. Additionally, educate yourself about the underlying technology, market trends, and potential risks. Staying informed and up-to-date with the latest developments in the cryptocurrency space is essential for making well-informed decisions. Seeking advice from financial professionals with experience in cryptocurrencies can also be beneficial. They can offer personalized guidance tailored to your financial situation and risk tolerance. [LINKED_TEXT: [2]] [URL: #vzivl] In conclusion, investing in cryptocurrencies can be worthwhile for some, but it's not without risks. The potential for high returns and technological innovations attracts many investors, but the volatile nature of the market requires caution and thorough research. Whether you decide to invest in cryptocurrencies or not, understanding the risks and potential rewards is crucial for making sound financial decisions.

But to understand why they are wrong one has to understand death statistics of India. India has 8.5–9 million deaths every year. When I first realised the size of this number I was zapped — so MANY people normally die every year. Over the last decade our death rate has been falling but our population including the aged population has been rising, approximately cancelling each other out. So as our population rises, one gets more deaths but because of gains in health care, the death rate has fallen and therefore the total number of deaths in the country has more or less held steady. So the 8.5 to 9 million number has stayed steady for a couple of decades. Every death in India doesnt get recorded. As can be seen in the write up quoted below, around a third of the deaths in India go unrecorded but as record keeping improves, this fraction has fallen to about 15-20% of deaths going unrecorded. The primary reason to get a death certificate is for property transfer, so only the destitute people in villages are cremated without death certificate. Even if a person doesn’t own property, the other relatives would need proof of death so that complex title deeds of agricultural property can get updated. [LINKED_TEXT: Data: How many Deaths are recorded in India every year?Deaths due to COVID-19 crossed 9000 mark recently.There are apprehensions about this reported number.What does data about recorded deaths in India tell ushttps://factly.in/data-how-many-deaths-are-recorded-in-india-every-year/] [URL: https://factly.in/data-how-many-deaths-are-recorded-in-india-every-year/]So deaths in villages need to be recorded for property ownership related reasons, even if the cremation is done in a field somewhere, piled with logs of wood. Whereas in cities, the destitute population is much higher but city crematoria require death certificate before they will accept for cremation and there is really no way to cremate a body in a big city without getting into trouble. So one should assume that the 20% unrecorded is the most likely number of unregistered deaths - the more we try to get data, the more accurate it gets and for 2020 we have got the most accurate records of all. So the unrecorded number is probably much lesser than 20%, likely less than 10%. Almost all the WHO estimates of excess deaths in India are supposed to be for 2021 when we had the lethal delta wave. The official estimate is 500,000+ total deaths. Of this 500,000, lets say 400,000 deaths were in 2021. That means 5% of total deaths in India (which is 8.5 to 9 million) were due to Covid. Notice that it is a small number - 5%. Cardiovascular disease is 30%, other infections like TB is 10%, the detailed pie chart is there in the quoted write ups. That part of the pie chart is is not going to change — same number of people are going to die of other causes as before, that's natural death. So for Covid death rate to rise to 4.7 million, total number of deaths has to be almost one and a half times higher than the usual 8.5 to 9 million. But total number of deaths in 2021 is not currently available. What is available is total number of deaths in 2020 which is 8.1 million. This is actually the registered number of deaths because of extra effort made by the Govt to get most of the deaths registered. Estimated deaths would be 9–10 million. In 2019 some 7.6 million deaths were registered. In 2018, 6.9 million were registered, 6.4 million in 2017 and 5.8 to 6.3 million deaths from 2007 to 2017 with about 100,000 rise each year. The rising trend of registered deaths is not because more people were dying in those years but clearly due to improved record keeping. Also, it is related to improved data transmission - because the deaths are always registered in the local place but because of lack of data compilation, they would not be collated and analysed. Now with computerization and internet they are more accessible for compilation [LINKED_TEXT: Explained: The death data in CRS, and why they do not tell the full story of India’s Covid-19 tollThere has been unusually high interest in the CRS data for 2020, especially the death numbers contained therein, because of the large number of deaths caused by the pandemic. About 1.49 lakh people died due to Covid-19 in 2020, according to official figures.https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/india-death-data-2020-coronavirus-7901020/] [URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/india-death-data-2020-coronavirus-7901020/]Clearly the death data has started to improve in the last few years, estimates however remain the same i.e. 8.5 - 9 million die each year. Govt says there were 140,000 deaths in 2020 due to Covid. Given the amount of Covid spread, that seems pretty believable to me. There were really no widespread reports of people dying in villages. We had a lockdown that for the most part prevented transmission and also the heightened sensitivity of people and Covid fear ensured that most Covid cases did get recorded. I would say maybe 150,000 Covid deaths in 2020 is all one should interpolate for lack of registration. Deaths in 2020 is just a tiny fraction of what WHO claims for India (4.7 million) The vast bulk of 4.7 million deaths in India projected by WHO would therefore have to come from 2021. The govt says close to 400,000 died of Covid in 2021. WHO estimates it 10 times higher at 4.5 million deaths. To know that for sure, we would need to see how many people died in 2021 in total. And that information is not yet available. Estimates for death rate in 2021 is 7.3% based on a projection, since actual data is not available. [LINKED_TEXT: India Death Rate 1950-2023Chart and table of the India death rate from 1950 to 2023. United Nations projections are also included through the year 2100.https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/IND/india/death-rate] [URL: https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/IND/india/death-rate]Calculating from that 7.3%, the number of deaths in India should be 10 million in 2021 (and another 10 million also in 2020 using same source). To say that there were excess deaths in India from Covid, we would need to see about 13–14 million deaths in India in the year 2021. The truth or lie of the WHO report would therefore require data on the actual numbers of registered death numbers that come out for 2021. If that number is less than 10 million, then WHO is way wrong in its calculations. Because 8–10 million people anyway die in India every year. Suddenly cannot have only half the expected number dying of usual causes just to say they died of covid to bolster inaccurate projections of WHO I think that in most Indian villages affected by Covid, based on a few conversations and hearsay, some 1-2 people died. But not every village got Covid. Since there are 650,000 odd villages in India, I guess estimate that around 1 million people AT MOST could have died due to Covid. More than the govt’s 400,000 but less than the WHO’s 4.7 million. And if it is a million deaths, then it will be just 10% of the country’s 10 million deaths and would be just a data blip that would be difficult to prove. But WHO claim of 4.7 million would really really stand out in the 2021 data and cannot be hidden. Thats a 50% jump in our country’s mortality. There can be little doubt that WHO is wildly wrong. There is no evidence presented by any of the papers cited by WHO that there were 14 million total deaths in India. That much number people would notice. We all live here and we know that didn't happen."},{"prompt":"What are some constraints on innovation that are preventing us from becoming the science fiction world so many movies predicted?","completion":"To sum it up in a one liner - capitalism®. The current system isn’t progress-oriented, but rather interest or profit oriented.

It then converts the recordings from specific movements into signals that are used to control all sorts of devices wirelessly. You can control stuff such as drones, appliances and even heavy machinery just by moving your hand. The catch? It costs a mere 1000. If this kind of technology were distributed equally, the accessibility to new technology would accelerate our potential to invent and progress exponentially; yeah, sure we have more groundbreaking innovations right now, but even those technologies (or at least the high quality stuff) are available to those who can afford them.

To support my answer, here are some waring incidences: Arjun can be called the greatest warrior because he single handedly dominated the Virat war (last day of Agyatvas). His foes included Karna, Bhishma, Ashwatthama, Duryodhan, Shakuni etc. Yet Arjun faced difficulty while slaying Bhishma, Drona, Karna & Bhagadatta. He killed the four by means of Krishna’s tricks. Also Bhagadatta had defeated Arjun during the Ashwamedh yagya of Indraprastha after fighting a 21 days of battle with him.Abhimanyu. Throught the first 12 days of Kurukshetra war, Abhimanyu stayed undefeated. Not a single Kuru warrior could defeat Abhimanyu. Although in few occasions Abhimanyu had to fall back (day 2 Abhimanyu vs Bhishma battle. But this does not prove Bhishma stronger than Abhimanyu as Bhishma had to fall back against him on day 1) (day 8 Abhimanyu & Bheem both could not defeat Bhagadatta alone until Arjun joined them). On day 13 Abhimanyu defeated every single warrior in the Chakravyuh and the kauravas had to break the war rules to brutally murder him. In the Chakravyuh, Abhimanyu had defeated Karna 3 times.Bhishma. He stayed undefeated till the very last moment when he dropped his weapons after seeing Shikhandi. Bhishma had defeated Lord Parshuram during his young days. This in itself proves how divinely powerful he must be. Although there were certain occasions when Bhishma had to retreat while facing Arjun, Abhimanyu, Satyaki, Bheem. This proves that every fighter was a human who got tired & who made mistakes.Karna. Karna could could not save Duryodhan from the Gandharva. It was Arjun who saved him. Also karna failed against Arjun during Virat war. But on day 16 & 17 of Kurukshetra war Karna used his divine Vijay bow. Lord Parshuram had blessed him that he wont face a defeat unless and untill he had this bow in hand. And so Karna dominated Arjun. On these two days Karna was definitely stronger than Arjun. But destiny was to be blamed and Arjun beheaded him while he was unarmed. Not to forget that without his celestial Vijay bow he faced defeat to Abhimanyu on day 13 & without Vijay bow he was defeated by Bheem on day 17.

Not a single Pandav warrior could face the wrath of Ashwatthama that day.Dronacharya. The teacher of all! Yudhisthir had to lie to his Dharma to slay this noble soul.

Satyaki had once attacked Bhishma with such brutality that even the mighty Pitahmah had to take cover from Alambush.Ghatotkach. How can we forget the might son of Bheem! The last and only resort to slay him was Karna’s Vasavi Shakti weapon. Wonder what might happen if Karns had not got this weapon under his arsenals. Ghatotkach was singly battling against Karna, Ashwatthama, Duryodhan, Shakuni & Kripacharya and yet dominated them all at once.Bheem! The strongest of all if strength is considered. Not just with the mace but with his Vayavya bow he was a great archer too! On day 17 Bheem had defeated Karna in bow fight. Karna fell onto his chariot unconscious! But not to forget he was also defeated by Karna on day 14. Karna did not kill Bheem because of his promise given to Kunti. Bheem faced defeats from Bhishma, Drona & Bhagadatta as well. hence to conclude, I will say, truth & Dharma were the strongest warriors!

What do I do?","completion":"\\"If it doesn't challenge you, it won't change you.\\" ― Fred DeVito Focus on Compound Weightlifting Exercises To increase performance, strength, and size, these four exercises are on top of the list. Bench PressSquatDeadliftMilitary Press All these are compound exercises, meaning they all work multiple joints and muscle groups when performed. For example, the bench press activates the muscle groups in the chest, triceps, and shoulders. What Makes These Exercises The Best These exercises work multiple muscle groups in the body, hence increasing the efficiency in your workouts. To maximize your full body potential, you should aim to target the biggest muscle group in the body which is the gluteus maximus. This is also commonly known as glutes that contain three muscles in the back of each hip. Why You Should Lift Weights Lifting weights is a form of exercise that helps with fat metabolism. But if new to strength training, you will be able to gain muscle rapidly and lose fat at the same time. However, once your body adapts to the initial change, it will take more time to gain muscle by lifting heavier weights. Along with proper recovery and nutrition, weightlifting enables the body to build muscle. By lifting heavy weights that your body has not adapted to, it essentially breaks down the muscle tissue in that particular body part. Besides burning more fat and building the physique that you want, lifting weights also: Promote anabolic hormones (growth hormones and testosterone) production.Help keep the muscle that you already have.Increase your basal metabolic rate by having more muscles in the body.Decrease the level of cortisol, the stress hormone in the body. The Benefits of Testosterone Studies have shown having higher testosterone levels can subdue fat cells creation while having lower testosterone levels can promote fat creation and obesity. This is especially important if you have a higher level of fat because it's generally associated with having lower testosterone level. Because of the inverse relationship between testosterone and cortisol leve[LINKED_TEXT: l] [URL: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8884416], you should do exercises that maximize testosterone production. You produce testosterone naturally because it’s the most important male sex hormone.[1] 270 to 1070 ng/dL[2] is the range of testosterone level in men according to the book Androgens and the Aging Male by Stephen J. Winters and Ilpo T. Huhtaniemithe. How to Perform Compound Exercises Please consult with your physician to decide if you're physically suited to do these exercises. Injuries can occur with these exercises, so do them at your own risk. Use the steps below as mere guidelines if you're performing these exercises for the first time to prevent potential injuries. Listen to your body, especially if you have pain from previous or lingering injuries. Warm up each exercise with just body weight or very light weights.Then do the exercise with just the barbell.Slowly increase the weights on the barbell with 10 pounds (5-pound plates on each side) increments to find your target weight.Find a target weight that you can do 4 to 6 repetitions (70 to 85 percent of your 1 maximum repetition) to maximize strength with optimal volume.Rest 3 to 4 minutes in between each set (I usually do 3 sets) for optimal reproducibility. Depending on your goal, you may be content with your current lift weight. But if you are looking to get stronger, you will have to slowly increase your lift weight while staying within the 4 to 6 repetition range. Closing Thoughts The squats, deadlifts, bench press, and military press are the top four compound exercises that target multiple muscle groups in the body, including the biggest muscle gluteus maximus. To build strength for a particular part of the body, you may have to do isolation exercises such as bicep curls for your biceps. The one hour of exercise is only a small part of the equation in building a strong muscular body. The other 23 hours of recovery time along with proper nutrients for the body to replenish and grow are way more important! Whatever your goal is with strength training, remember that there are compromises along the way such as having too much muscle can limit flexibility in the body. Be aware of your goal in strength training because having too much muscle mass can be disadvantageous. Ultimately you want to build a body uniquely catered to your goals. Because I run, cycle, rock climb, and swim, I don't want too much muscle because that will hinder my recreational goals. Now I perform strength training with the sole purpose of maintenance.

To become a skilled writer, you ought to be a good reader. Being a creative writer is synonymous with being a good reader. To improve your skills in writing, you have to read fruitful books. You might not realize at first but what you read will indirectly make an impact in your use of words, sentence construction, vocabulary, use of punctuation, imaginative skills, just to mention a few. 2. You have to face the fear of rejection and criticism Most writers have grown a tough skin towards readers’ criticism of their works. They have also seen rejection as a pathway to success. To become a successful writer, you have to accept that your manuscript might be rejected a couple of times and readers might say unpleasant words about your works. How do you react? Learn from these and ensure that it improves your writing skills. 3. Network and socialize with other writers With the advent of social media, it has become easier to join groups with people that share similar interests with you. Surprisingly, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Quora…and even WhatsApp, are great platforms to connect with other writers and share your write-ups. 4. Remember to never give up While you’re trying to perfect your draft and you keep writing and editing, remember to never give up. No writer had their first draft right. They kept writing, re-writing and editing. Never forget that! 5. There’s ‘money’ in writing Do you intend to become a professional writer and you believe you have what it takes to become one? Start perfecting your skill in writing. Apply for freelance writing jobs, register for online writing skills and read fruitful books. Best-selling authors like Stephen King, Paulo Coehlo, and J.K Rowling were discouraged at the beginning of their writing career. They never gave up and look at where they are today!

These mistakes are: 1. Not making time table- Students who are not making time table are committing a big mistake, they all are preparing but they don’t have a path on which they have to go. Time table helps you to give a path to reach the goal that is clearing GATE exam. You do have to make time table in which you have to set deadlines for each topics. These deadline will give you a little pressure which will ultimately help you in boosting you efficiency. 2. Not being Consistency- Many students are studying but not on regular basis or they haven’t fixed the time for their studies. You have to study daily. You have to stick to your time table. You may feel not to study on a day or two. But you have to study regularly and keep hustling until your exam date. Consistency is the key to success. Many students fails to crack GATE exam because they aren’t consistent. Don’t commit the same mistakes like other by not being consistent. 3. Referring to many materials- If you’re referring too many materials then you are doing a blunder mistake. Referring too many material will ultimately waste your time and energy. You don’t have time to waste. Whatever time you have got for your preparation, you have to utilize it properly. There are many materials that are available for GATE preparation. You have to choose any one best material for you preparation. I would recommend Notes4u(.in) material for GATE. I found it best and it do cover whole syllabus of GATE. You all can consider it. 4. Not giving mocks- Students usually wait for completing their syllabus and then give a mock test. But I would say it is wrong thing to do. You have to give mocks even if you haven’t completed your syllabus. Mock test helps in improving yourself. Through writing mock test, you will be able to identify your mistakes. You have to avoid committing those mistakes in future mocks. Instead of committing same mistake, commit new mistakes. Every mistake give you a chance to improve. You can analyse your performance through mock test. So, it is must to give mock test. Try to give at least 50 mocks test before actual examination of GATE. Try not to commit these mistakes that are stated above. If you are successful in not committing these mistakes then you will be ahead of other aspirants.

Their primary function is to connect the gap between business requirements and technology solutions. The key responsibilities of a business analyst include: Requirements Gathering: Business analysts work closely with stakeholders, including clients, business users, and technical teams, to elicit, document, and analyze requirements. Their task is to identify the needs, goals, and constraints of the project or system and ensure that all relevant information is collected. Process Analysis: They assess existing business processes and workflows to understand their operations and identify inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and areas for optimization. Techniques such as process mapping and modeling are used to visualize and document the current and future state of processes. Solution Design: Business analysts collaborate with stakeholders and development teams to design appropriate solutions based on requirements and analysis. They help define functional and non-functional specifications, create prototypes or wireframes, and assist in making technology and architecture decisions. Documentation: Business analysts are responsible for creating comprehensive and accurate documentation throughout the project lifecycle. This includes writing business requirements documents (BRDs), functional specifications, use cases, user stories, process flow diagrams, and other relevant artifacts. Stakeholder Management: They act as a liaison between different stakeholders, facilitating effective communication and understanding between business users, project managers, developers, and other team members. They ensure that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of requirements and project goals. Data Analysis: Business analysts may also be involved in analyzing data to identify trends, patterns, and insights that can inform business decisions. They may work with databases, conduct data mining, or use statistical techniques to interpret and present findings. Change Management: Business analysts help manage the impact of change within an organization. They identify potential risks and obstacles and develop strategies for the successful implementation of new processes or systems. They may also assist in training and providing support to users during the transition. Quality Assurance: They collaborate with testing teams to define test cases and validate that the implemented solution meets the defined requirements. They participate in user acceptance testing (UAT) and ensure that the solution meets the business needs and objectives. Continuous Improvement: Business analysts actively seek opportunities to improve business processes and systems. They stay updated on industry trends, emerging technologies, and best practices to provide innovative solutions and enhance operational efficiency. It is imperative to note that the specific responsibilities of a business analyst can vary depending on the organization, industry, and project requirements.

After all, you want to be able to use it for years and make money from it as well. Transferring a domain name is relatively easy. All you need is to find someone who can provide you with the legal paperwork and transfer the domain to them. To help you with this task, here are the three main steps to take: Registration - When a person registers a domain, it is also called a domain name. A domain name is the actual address of your website, which is what people will type into their browsers when they try to access your website. Domain Name - You have now registered your domain name. When someone enters your domain name in a search engine, you will be notified that your website has been found. Transfer of Ownership - You now need to find the person who is going to own your domain name. This person will need to take ownership of the domain, which is how they will be able to transfer it to you. Transfer of Registration - Once you have taken ownership of the domain name, it is now your responsibility to find the owner of your domain. To do this, you need to fill out an online form. It's important to find a reputable domain registrar who can provide you with the necessary information to perform the transfers. While it is important to find a good registrar, be sure to check the reputation of the company before you register your domain. Transfer of Name - This step is also quite simple. Just be sure that you get the proper registration and transfer of ownership form so that the transfer goes smoothly. Transfer of Registration - This is the third step. Here, you will need to do the following things: Transfer of Name - When a person registers a domain name, it is also called a domain name. A domain name is the actual address of your website, which is what people will type into their browsers when they try to access your website. Transfer of Ownership - You now need to find the person who is going to own your domain name. This person will need to take ownership of the domain, which is how they will be able to transfer it to you."},{"prompt":"Do British people wholeheartedly agree with Suella Braverman when she said “Boris Johnson is one of the greatest prime ministers ever”?","completion":"He was an unmitigated disaster."},{"prompt":"What is the cheapest country to visit from India?","completion":"Top 5 Cheapest Countries To Visit From India In 2022 Which Will Cost You Less Than 50K!

It is not accurate to pinpoint a single group or organization that controls all aspects of global affairs. However, there are several key players and influential entities that shape the world to varying degrees: 1. Governments and political leaders: Governments hold significant power and authority in their respective countries and play a crucial role in making policies, enacting laws, and representing their citizens on the global stage. Political leaders and politicians have varying degrees of influence in shaping national and international agendas. 2. International organizations: Entities like the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Trade Organization (WTO), and regional organizations such as the European Union (EU) and African Union (AU) play important roles in global governance, diplomacy, economic cooperation, and humanitarian efforts. 3. Corporations and businesses: Multinational corporations, large companies, and influential business leaders exert considerable economic influence globally. They impact industries, trade, and investment, and often have significant lobbying power and influence over policy decisions. 4. Financial institutions: Central banks, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States or the European Central Bank, have a substantial impact on monetary policies and global financial stability. They regulate interest rates, control the money supply, and influence economic conditions. 5. Media organizations: Media outlets and conglomerates shape public opinion, influence political narratives, and provide information and entertainment on a global scale. Media organizations have the power to set agendas and shape public discourse. 6. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs): NGOs play a crucial role in advocating for social and environmental causes, providing humanitarian aid, and influencing policy and public opinion. Organizations like Amnesty International, Greenpeace, and Médecins Sans Frontières are examples of influential NGOs. It's important to note that the influence and power of these entities can vary significantly depending on factors such as geopolitical dynamics, economic strength, cultural influence, and the collective actions of individuals and societies. The global landscape is complex, and power is distributed among various actors, making it challenging to pinpoint a single entity that \\"runs\\" the world."},{"prompt":"What did you get for Christmas 2017?","completion":"2020 answer: HoverboardPuffy comfy coatA Phone A watchA hoodieRoom Decor :D"},{"prompt":"’m moving with my cats from a very stressful home, & they use their cat trees for comfort now.

You cheated on him…you really can't do a “right” thing following cheating someone. I'm not judging you, you didn't say anything annoying or totally self centered, so I'll assume that you're a good person who isn't sure. But since what you did wasn't great, there's not a great way to deal with it. Hopefully you have otherwise been a kind and caring partner, and the cheating is a seperate issue, not an indicator of how little you care in general. You can only do the less damaging thing, and I think it's less damaging at this point not to tell. Keep it to yourself and commit to doing better if you want to stay with them. Some people might say I'm wrong or dishonest or whatever, but here's what I've learned from relationship experience. Cheating on someone is obviously a crappy thing to do…but telling your significant other is just sharing the hurt with them. If you want the relationship to continue, then you're better off moving forward, not dwelling on it or creating extra drama in your relationship with someone you've already hurt. That said, there are a few situations where telling them is probably the better option. If you cheated with someone that's going to tell, or for some reason, someone else already knows who might tell, you think you're likely to pass on an STD to them, or you are pregnant from that encounter, or want to end your relationship anyway, I would say those are fair reasons to tell the person you cheated on first...because they're going to be hurt anyway. But if it's possible for them not to know, it will be less painful. Otherwise, telling them will just hurt them and make them feel inadequate. I can promise you it won't make things better. I've been in your shoes. Ultimately, it comes down to why you cheated and how likely it is to happen again. It's easy to say you love someone and won't do it again, but it's also possible that you won't stop, even if you do love them. I don't know why, but some people just have REALLY poor impulse control, to the point that they will repeat destructive behavior like cheating, even though they know better, want to do better, and truly love and don't want to hurt the person they are with. But it still hurts them. And someone on the outside doesn't understand how this can keep happening. If this is you, seriously consider how much you want to keep hurting this person, and if you're better off breaking up now. Don't let the relationship die a slow painful death while you create drama by repeatedly cheating and letting them find out, a good person doesn't deserve that. If you are inclined to cheat, you're better off in a situation where there isn't an expectation of monogamy…seriously. It just doesn't work for some people. If you truly think this was a drunk fueled, or otherwise misguided, ONE time mistake, and you will NOT do it again, then the best thing for your relationship would have been for him not to know, because it creates a crack that can never be fixed. It hurts them to know, and telling the other party is usually more about sharing your guilt or bad feelings with them to appease yourself, but you earned those feelings…you just have to move though them and learn. Telling your partner just hurts them. I haven't been cheated on personally, to my knowledge, but I can't imagine how hurt and insecure it could make someone feel. There's way more than I can go into here, but that's my opinion based on trial and error, multiple times over the years. If I can pass this on and help someone, I would love to. However, seeing as how you already told him before you asked if you should, I have a feeling that you will probably do what you're gonna do and think about it later. But maybe I'm wrong, I don't know you. Really…just think about the least hurtful thing you can do for everyone, and go with that"},{"prompt":"What does Ferrari mean in Italian?

But afterimages are a result of an image that continues to appear in one's vision after the exposure to the original image has ceased. And this is only because the vision is lacking in reflex. To most shinobi, shisui might create afterimages, but to people with superior reflexes only see a one shisui running around. Minato and tobirama are considered the fastest shinobi in their Era, and this isn't because of teleportation and Ay knows that. When considering speed, reflexes and reaction play an important factor, and chakra control and volume makes it all possible. The body flicker is a D rank jutsu, which involves high speed movement with the help of Chakra. Not suitable for fights due to inability to effectively use it for the lack of reflexes and better reactions, a case similar to Kakashi's chidori, tunnel vision. For speed freaks like Minato and tobirama who use ftg, shisui might as well be a snail. Minato was almost toying with A, who has a combination of enhanced reflexes and reaction than even sasuke’s sharingan, lightning armor and a body flicker at its top. And we all know, shisui isn't as fast as A at all. The fastest one with a body flicker is Minato, Tobirama gave his blessing too. Secong is the second hokage Tobirama.

More recently, substitute ‘Russia’ for ‘USSR’. Barack Obama’s comments about Brexit are in line with what previous administrations wanted. Donald Trump has said many things which go against previous American foreign policy, and are in line with Russian foreign policy. There is, obviously, a great deal of uncertainty and debate about why this is the case. It might be unconnected to Russia, and related to the fact that Trump seems to get his news from far right, conspiracy-prone sources of the “George Soros pays Mexican gang members to pretend to be refugees” variety, and they’re hostile to the EU. But it might be unconnected to that as well. It might be the fact that the EU countries, with a press that the government can’t control and politicians who have to worry about elections, can’t flatter him in the way that Turkey, Russia, Saudi Arabia, North Korea etc. have, but on the contrary have treated him as fairly comical.

While most drivers choose to buy (or finance) a new car, many shoppers swear that leasing a car is the better decision. So which is correct? When does leasing make more sense than buying? And should you consider it? To help you decide whether leasing is a good idea for you, we've rounded up all the benefits and drawbacks of leasing, and we've laid out our opinions about when you should lease and when you should buy. Benefits of Leasing The biggest benefit of [LINKED_TEXT: leasing a car] [URL: https://silverbackautomotive.com/] rather than buying is that you can usually get more car for your money by leasing. A lease involves paying the depreciation on the car rather than the entire purchase price. For example, if you lease a 20,000 car for 3 years and its projected value at the end of those 3 years is 12,000, then you only make lease payments on the 8,000 difference. If you had bought the car, you'd be making payments on the entire 20,000. Leasing also benefits drivers who don't have much money saved up for a down payment. Many lease deals are available with nothing down or 1,000 down, whereas smart shoppers who finance usually put down 10 to 20 percent of a car's purchase price. There's also the obvious benefit of leasing: You get a new car every few years. If you sign a 5-year loan to purchase a car, you'll be making payments for the next five years, and if you want out, you'll have to sell the car yourself, which can take time, or trade it in for a new model, which can be expensive. If you're leasing a car, your obligation is released as soon as the lease is over, which usually happens every 2 or 3 years, and you'll be free to go get a new model. Drawbacks of Leasing The biggest drawback of leasing is that you aren't building up any equity in your vehicle. Think of it like buying a home: With every mortgage payment, you own a little more of your home. But if you rent your home, just like if you lease a car, your money isn't increasing your ownership stake. As a result, when someone has finished making payments on a leased car, he or she will have to buy or lease another car. When someone has finished making payments on a financed car, he or she owns the vehicle outright with no further payments. Another drawback to leasing is that many leases often come with a mileage restriction. In order to get many good lease deals that are offered by automakers, you'll need to agree to keep your miles low -- usually around 10,000 or 12,000 per year. If you can't do that, the lease rate will go up, or you'll be stuck paying expensive mileage penalties at the end of your lease. Drivers who lease will also have to take very good care of their leased cars. Automakers assume that leased cars will be returned in roughly \\"new-car\\" condition, and they can charge you for excess wear and tear if a leased car is returned with scrapes, bumps and dents."},{"prompt":"Should we be disrespectful to former presidents if we disagree with them politically?

The big reward I’ve gotten is time. To say that Brave has powerful ad-blocking and tracker-prevention gives a false impression : That Brave is for people who don’t like ads and worry about privacy. Most people grumble about these issues, but speed is what really matters. A second-delay while browsing the web is a huge mental disruption. It’s as if you’re reading a book, flip a page, and the lights go out for one second. Yes, it’s just a second. But you were reading. Caught up in the context of a stream of thought. Ads and trackers slow your browser down. Because they are communicating in this elaborate two-way chatter between your machine and various back-end servers. Brave shuts that down and removes those delays. Here are my stats from 2 weeks of Brave : Brave shows you this whenever you open a new tab. They’re proud of it. With good reason, apparently. 51,000 ads !? Yup. Almost a thousand trackers. Mmhmm. But look at the 44 minutes. You might think 44 minutes over two weeks is nice, sure. Not some epic breakthrough in productivity but impressive enough - now I can watch an extra Black Mirror episode. But you shouldn’t think of it as a single block of time. Rather, break it down into one-second delays. You’re reading a book, flip a page, and the lights go out for a second. Brave prevented 2,800 of those micro-blackouts. Now, the analogy is a bit of a stretch. After all, there is always some delay when you load a new page. So to state it more accurately, we might say that Brave cut the duration of 5,000 of those black-outs in half. No matter how you parse this out, it becomes clear this is a Big Fucking Deal. During the last 2 weeks, I also opted in to Brave’s ad program. Meaning I volunteer to allow Brave to serve up little, tweet-sized ads. These ads don’t interfere with content, they appear above the browser - no graphics, just text. Brave is clever about not pushing your patience with this. It seems to sense when you’re busy. When I’m typing away like I am now, Brave never serves up an ad. It also will take long stretches of time where it shows no ads at all - so much so I have wondered whether my ads are still on. I opted in for ads because of the other reward Brave offers: a cryptocurrency called BAT (Basic Attention Token). In two weeks I accrued about 5 bucks worth. (Most of it was a random direct gift from Brave, which they do occasionally. But some from ad-watching.) My BAT fortune sits in a wallet I can check any time. I can just hold it. Given historical explosions in value for certain cryptocurrencies, no telling how valuable it might become. But I’ll probably use it to tip content-creators. Small operators on YouTube who don’t have millions of subscribers, but who work hard to cover less popular subjects like astronomy. Or who got demonetized for political reasons. That sort of thing. Brave has enrolled many thousands of content-creators thus far (including some major news outlets), but most small-time creators aren’t signed up yet. (For recent stats see [LINKED_TEXT: Monitoring Brave Browser adoption] [URL: https://batgrowth.com/] ) So I’m going to hold these BAT and hand them out as my favorite channels enroll.

I think developers get paid on the basis of complexity or time taken for the project to get completed.

To know about these masks, these are respiratory protective masks designed to achieve a very close facial fit. The N95 means that these masks are subjected to block at least 95 percent of very small approx 0.3 microns test particles. If you are wearing these masks properly, then the filtration capabilities can be exceeded to those of face masks. In N95 respirators, edges are designed to form a seal around the nose and mouth. These masks are commonly used in healthcare settings and are a subset of N95 filtering respirators and are referred to as N95. Some Precautions While Using N95 Respirators If you are someone who is suffering from any chronic respiratory, cardiac or other medical conditions then you should check with a health care provider before using it because it can make it more difficult for the wearer to breathe. Some models have exhalation valves that can make breathing easier. These respirators are labeled as single-use disposable devices.

What happened in 1933 was different — gold was prohibited as legal tender in the US. “Executive Order 6102 is an executive order signed on April 5, 1933, by US President Franklin D. Roosevelt \\"forbidding the hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States.\\" But in the post-WW2 years, with the US having 75 percent of the world’s gold reserves, the US did give the Europeans gold in exchange for their dollars. But as European economies and exports strengthened by the 1960s, thedrain on America’s gold reserves became so great, especially by the British, that Nixon had to shut that down. Interestingly, inflation went way up after this happened. The paper dollar lost value in people’s eyes, a logical consequence of totally disconnecting the dollar from gold."},{"prompt":"What TV series are worth watching?","completion":"Netflix is a great way to catch up on your favorite shows, but it can be hard to decide which ones to watch.

Whether you’re looking for something lighthearted or serious, there’s something for everyone on Netflix. The Dragon Prince is a Netflix original show that originally premiered in 2018. It tells the story of two young women who are training to be dragon riders—and it may be one of the best shows you've never heard of.

Since then, the show has received critical acclaim and has gained a cult following. Season 3 was released on Netflix in late 2019, and it is highly recommended if you're looking for a show to watch. TV series like Black Lightning have been making a big comeback in the past few years. While other superhero series are focused on fighting evil, Black Lightning focuses on the issue of police brutality and the lack of attention given to communities of color.

I never gave him the satisfaction of a response though. Over the course of those two weeks I would tend to walk past his door a lot which was just a regular door padded from the inside with a big window. I began to notice an odor coming from the room that resembled urine that only got stronger as the days went by. Then one day I found out why. When they finally went in to check on him he had been masturbating everywhere in the room and everything that came out he wasn't cleaning up so it was just sitting developing an odor of semen and urine mixed. Walked by the room and there was yellow and brown splotches all over the blue vinyl padding on the floor in the room. I shut my door with permission so the smell wouldn't get into my room.

This was our first trip to Mumbai, a one day journey through train. We somehow reached Mumbai at 9/9:30 and then we started to explore the much talked about sites, the likes of the Taj hotel, Gateway of India, Fashion street, etc.. We were all tired by the end of the day and it was time to leave. We reached CST and even after continuously searching for the train to Pune we didn't find any, at last we boarded the passenger train to Lonavala. We found empty seats to our amusement, we sat or you could say slept on the the empty seats.. Slowly by each passing station the train was being occupied. We realized that it would be filled in the next 1–2 stations and it did. After almost an hour of travel we reached Kalyan station and we all 6 were sitting besides each other and suddenly a middle-aged man requested one of my friends to vacate the place, we didn't find his request to be a request rather it seemed like an order. The next thing my friend does was really not what we expected as he was a studious and a shy guy by nature and rarely did he reciprocate. Fellow passengers watching this joined in with the man and not did they request but actually ordered to vacate the place, as we all were young and could not understand the situation tried to respond in a similar manner and we backed our friend stating we would not vacate the place as we got the seats first. Quickly the whole compartment turned against us and few started to abuse so we had to take a step back and not only did we have to vacate one place but all the six. We didn't understand what had we done but we saw something unusual as all the people occupying the seats got up and vacated the place for the once standing. Later few stations ahead there was a group of men who explained what had happend to us. He stated that it is an unwritten rule in local trains of Mumbai that once the train completes an hour all those who are siting need to vacate their places for the once who are standing as it is more than 2 hours journey till Lonavala and people work for more than 8 hours a day and travel for more than 4 hours a day.

You can see more possibilities when facing issues and confront complexity rather than adopt conventional wisdom. Teachers often find high IQ students “miss the point” owing to their own lack of depth.

Causing the loop of hate to continue rather than blaming both parties and trying to end it. I will consider myself immoral and an idiot if I generalize Quran-burning practice to the whole of Sweden's population. In Egypt, if a Muslim burns the Christian Bible in public, s/he can get from 1 to 5 years in prison because we know that they are trying to target stupid individuals to riot and cause damage. It also encourages other Islamophobic individuals to feel supported or justified in acting in harmful and unethical ways toward other uninvolved, peaceful Muslims. Funny enough, It also promotes the Quran to be read by unaware people and check Islam. If those individuals are rational enough to distinguish between Islamophobic claims and what Islam really teaches with the support of some real scholarly knowledge, they might understand that some so-called Muslims are acting out of line with what their religion is teaching, and they can use it to their own advantage. Instead of confirming the stereotype and generating more hate, you can use it to shame those individuals into acting in line with Islam. Egyptians do it a lot, and it is a powerful disciplinary tool to use (though it can be misused if the Individuals are talking about false information or false interpretation or if the one taking advice is so arrogant that there is no hope in them). So instead of rioting and causing destruction in the streets, Muslims can go and do a peaceful demonstration with Quran recitation or any other peaceful way because It is haram for us humans to harm an uninvolved party along with the sins of others. “And no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another.

Leasing is less expensive, it is a fact. With the rising retail and inflation prices of many cars, leasing is often the most flexible financial way to purchase a new vehicle. When leasing a vehicle for the first or fifth time you should expect to put down a very low or minimal down payment along with lower monthly payments compared to outright vehicle financing. A lease is a seamless transition to obtain a new car for less money than you would have to outlay out over the vehicle term life. Leasing enables a lower cost of maintenance opportunity for the lessee. A leases term life almost always ends before the vehicle requires major service or new tires, so maintenance costs remain negligent. Leased vehicles are typically under the original manufacturer protection, so lessee’s do not need to be concerned about the costs of repairs as long as they are problems covered by the warranty. When a purchaser begins to act as a lessee and not a owner, they have the opportunity to receive a new car every 2 to 3 years. Most people admit that they always want to be in the latest car out there to hit the streets. Using a lease as a purchasing mechanism, the lease can offer a quicker time lapse than the standard purchase cycle, which equates to six years. Leases are also easier to be released from. Once the lease term is completed, assuming there are no over-mileage or excessive damage, you can drop off the leased car and move on to whatever is next. This is a lot easier than buying a car with a long loan period, and exhausting the car prior to the loan maturity; especially if you owe more on the car than what it is worth. Last but not least, when you lease a car and you begin to have a lease turnover every 2–3 years you will receive the newest safety vehicle requirements. As we all know, you can not trust other drivers on the road but you can trust the newest safety measures that auto producers develop every year. Having the newest vehicles on the road increases the safety of yourself and the people you drive with everyday."},{"prompt":"As an IITian, what is the best piece of advice you would give to a JEE aspirant?","completion":"Hi, The best piece of advise that I can give is , if you have clear vision that you have to get into an IIT, then just believe in yourself and what you study and keep a track on your status throughout your preparation.

Yes: Join upwork, market your skills and build a portfolio. Focus on getting excellent feedback and build your business from there. If you're high quality, promote that. If you're cheap, promote that. If you try do both, good luck with that. No: Setup a product based business. Find gaps in existing marketplaces (they exist, read my other 'Amazon' answers) and create your brand. Set up your own ecommerce website later. It's better to have some startup capital for a product based business, but it can be done without. In both instances provide a fantastic service / product, get social proof, then tell the world.

There is no “after”, unless you mean that available computing power hits a peak and then begins to decline. Viewing range is always going to cost exponentially more computing power to extend. Imagine being able to stand at the top of a skyscraper in a video game and use a telescope to view photorealistic, continuously updated renderings for miles. Physical detail is a similar problem, imagine being able to examine the brickwork of a wall and make out the shape of each individual brick sticking out of the mortar and detect every subtle misalignment in the brickwork, examine the unique grain of every individual brick. Increasing display resolution and the introduction of new display types is merely arithmetic, but don’t discount it. Generating a visual for each eye to produce stereographic imaging may only double the computation load, and the human eye has limits on resolution which we’ll approach eventually. But something can be non-infinite while also being non-trivial. Physics are part of visual realism, and this makes both the distance viewing problem and the detail problem both insanely more difficult to reach total realism. Realistic atmospheric effects rather than painted skyboxes, realistic effects when you hammer a brick to break off a corner and expose some of the interior, realistic collision dynamics when you drop the brick on the ground and bits of it knock off but there is still partial elasticity because the whole brick doesn’t break…then extend that to everything in the game. Eventually, computers will get so powerful that one can simulate reality so perfect that your natural eyes and brain would never be able to tell the difference…but by then people will be using computers to extend their mental capabilities significantly. So the bar for a completely realistic simulation just keeps getting raised. Until you hit some absolute limit on how powerful computers can be in principle. Which would probably be the universe collapsing or burning out or whatever. Again, there is no “after”."},{"prompt":"Why does this generation have a lot of depressed people?","completion":"There are a variety of factors that can contribute to depression in this generation. These include increased stress and pressure from school and work, difficulty adjusting to rapidly changing technology, increased feelings of isolation due to social media, and a lack of meaningful connections with others. Additionally, mental health issues can be exacerbated by the current political climate, economic instability, and increased exposure to traumatic events through news and social media. TO SUPPORT FOLLOW ME!"},{"prompt":"What will happen if 1 will be equal to 1 rupee? What will be the consequences?","completion":"First of all, let me clarify that the currency value of a country doesn't necessarily mean the strength of that economy. If that were to be the case, then the Bangladeshi economy would've been stronger than the Japaneseeconomy as 1 Bangladeshi Taka is equal to 1.4 Japanese Yen. Now let's envision what would have happened if 1 rupee equals to 1 dollar, w.r.t. the India, Pros of the situation:1) First of all buying goods will be cheaper as the price of imports will be cheaper.2)Buying luxury goods will also be cheaper - you can easily buy an I-Phone 7 for Rs.542!3) As imports would be cheaper, this would reduce the price of petrol and diesel, leading to low transportation costs. Cons of the situation:But on the other side of the coin, the story is totally different.1) Exports will fall, as they'll become expensive and why would any country buy our products if they can get it through other countries at a cheaper rate.2) There will also be a decrease in foreign investment as investing in our country will become expensive as compared to other countries. One of the main reasons why foreign countries invest in India is because of the cheap price.3) Also, the unemployment rate will go up, as few would hire an Indian at Rs.75,000 if they can get an outsider at 3000.4) Many companies will move out of India as their expenses will be high, and their businesses non-profitable.5) Even your maid, with a salary of, say Rs.4,000 can buy seven I-Phone 7! This can be clearly seen that if 1 rupee would've been equal to 1 dollar, there would've been a high unemployment rate and a slower economic growth, because of lesser foreign investment. Thus, the situation of a rupee being equal to a dollar is not affordable for a growing and a developing economy like India. A similar situation occurred in 2007-08 when 1 dollar was equal to about Rs 41. At that time, imports of the country was good, but the exports and the IT sector got affected a lot. INR vs. US in 2011-12Source: Google Now you will say what if we buy swadeshi (domestic) products only and boycott foreign goods.This situation would also not work, as it was a regular practice till 1990 when we used to use our own products. Since then, however, our economy has grown manifold, and if we boycott the goods of other nations, they may also boycott Indian goods! Another developing nation, China, has adopted the fixed exchange rate system, in which they decide the value of their currency with respect to the U.S. dollar, and whenever they want to increase their exports, they just depreciate the value of their currency (Yuan). The value of the INR from 1 in 1947 to 61 in 2014 to over 65 today! (w.r.t. the US) The falling value of the rupee (up to a certain extent) doesn't worry our Finance Minister and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor. They are more worried about the fluctuations of the rupee. If the value of the rupee yesterday was 60 and 70 today, there is too much fluctuations in the currency, which will have an adverse effect on the stability of the Indian economy. India has adopted the floating exchange rate system (since 1975). In the floating system, the value of the currency can't be determined by the RBI Governor, the Finance Minister or the government, it is determined by the currency demand & supply that prevails in the market. But still, the Finance Minister has some control over policy and foreign reserves, through which he tries to maintain a constant value of the rupee, by controlling the inflation rate, and in the process, prevents the currency from getting completely destroyed. Now lets come to reality, today 1 dollar is more than 65 rupees. As Indians, we do want our currency to be at a higher rate but at what cost? The cost of it, at this point in time, is too high (higher unemployment, lower economic growth and lower foreign investment). We can challenge the dollar later but first let our economy grow and don't forget what I mentioned above- cost of currency does not necessarily signify the strength of an economy."},{"prompt":"My 3yearold insists on sleeping on the floor.

The official reason is because of delays putting the entire project at risk - before the war even started. The war adds to the risks to a timeline that is already suffering. In addition to these legitimate and non-political reasons for dropping the Russian nuclear alternative, the Finns were looking for a way to get the Russians out of the project. There were threats to the construction permits (which may or may not have been grounded in law) and significant public and political pressure to keep the Russians out of critical infrastructure projects. “Fennovoima’s board saw no other option than to terminate the contract,” Chairman Esa Harmala said at a press conference. “This decision was not taken because of the war” but “because of delays and an inability to deliver, and we have seen the war added to these risks.” [LINKED_TEXT: Finland Drops Nuclear Plant Deal With Russian Energy Company (2)] [URL: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-02/finland-s-fennovoima-terminates-rosatom-nuclear-plant-contract-l2oe3k2j] Thanks for the A2A."},{"prompt":"Do your cats ‘help’ you with household chores?","completion":"No. They skedaddle whenever they see me pick up a broom or mop or get out the vacuum cleaner.

If somebody gave me 118 million, I wouldn't sneer and say, That's not enough.","completion":"393 million is the total box-office So the total price of movies tickets sold for the movie. The problem is that when you pay 8 for a Disney movie ticket, Disney don’t get 8. There is a part of this money that goes to the movie-theater. And there is also taxes. On average the studio get 50% of the ticket sales money (but it deeply depends of the country, and of the studio). Movie-theaters are not free. You need to rent a place, to buy projectors, to heat the theaters in winter and to cool it in summer, to pay cashiers, projectionists and security. So, 393 million of tickets sales worldwide means something like 200 million for Disney (at most). And 275 million is the budget for producing the movie.

Indeed, this was one of the things that drove the conservative Tea Party movement. Overall conservatives in the US are somewhat unified in the notion of every man for himself and low taxes for everyone. It is on that basis that they oppose student loan relief. What I think you are referring to, though, is that corporate lobbying tends to be slightly more effective (and I do mean slightly) toward GOP representatives than Democratic representatives. This is a result of the fact that GOP voters have a tendency to vote more on the basis of individual social issues, then a candidate's record overall. So a GOP voter will often vote for a candidate based on their anti-abortion stance and ignore their relationships with big business. Democratic voters have a tendency to vote on a wider range of issues. P.S. In recent times, the GOP has become an odd amalgamation of social conservatives, modestly educated voters, and the wealthy. The wealthy lobby the GOP to support big business and everybody else votes primarily based on social issues."},{"prompt":"What is the best opening sentence you have read in a book?","completion":"It was a dark and stormy night when suddenly the snot ran out…Your suspension of disbelief has probably just bust a leaf-spring: how can you believe in a story that begins that way?

People entering a movie after having one too many drinks(IDC of this), but starting to comment/talk out loud along the movie. These folks are epic. 3.) People munching the food(pizza/popcorn/nachos)etc right next to me isn’t always a pleasant experience. Had 4–5 people who purchased their seats and tried to buy one more later for one more person. Looks like I have found the one and only seat in the last row and I have purchased it. They have assumed to take my seat by coming early and thinking that the person will take corner seat. Which I did not obliged, and down begins their derogatory statements(in Hindi which they don’t know that I understand), and started to eat all the stuff that they can buy. Man! I have seen a lot of stuff that these guys are just scraping the tip of iceberg :P.

Try spinach, kale, bok choy, bean sprouts, corn, peas, or carrots.Eggs: Boiled or soft-boiled eggs are a popular addition to Ramen. For a creamy, savory kick, you can also poach an egg directly in the broth.Spices and seasonings: Give your Ramen some extra flavor with chili flakes, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, miso paste, or sesame oil.Cheese: A sprinkle of grated Parmesan or a slice of American cheese can add richness and creaminess to your Ramen.Noodles: Change things up by trying different types of noodles like soba, udon, or rice noodles."},{"prompt":"w did Alexander the Great leave such a lasting effect on the civilization of the Mediterranean, Egypt, and near East even though he swept through the area extremely quickly in only a few years?","completion":"Alexander the Great's conquest of the Persian Empire was really more of a hostile take over than a revolution. He basically went from satrapy to another and replaced the satraps, in some cases he even left the same satrap in power and just made them swear allegiance to him. Aside from that he mostly left the old Persian system of autonomy in place. He didn't drastically change the laws, administration, taxation, bureaucracy etc. So his empire mostly hummed along as before just with new management. The big changes that did occur occurred after his death, when his generals divided the empire up between themselves and so had to develop some new institutions. The most drastic being in Egypt, where the Ptolemies actively integrated themselves into the Egyptian political and religious system while also creating new Greco-Egyptian gods like Serapis. Outside of Egypt though the most lasting aspect of the Hellenistic period was mostly artistic. From modern India to modern Turkey you can see examples of Hellenistic influence on the local cultures, like these busts of Alexander the Great and Buddha respectively: Names also left some influence, Iskander, a Persianised form of Alexander, is a common name in the Middle East and South Asia today, and there are still a few “Iskandaryias\\" around Asia. There was also some residual influence on Jewish culture. The story of Gog and Magog from the Bible talks about how Alexander the Great built a gate in the Caucasus to keep out the demons of the Steppe (ie. Scythians and Turkic horse nomads). But apart from that the Hellenistic influence on the East wasn't all that strong."},{"prompt":"Why was the British Empire able to become so big/powerful when the UK is so small? What are some of the main factors that allowed the Empire to become so vast?","completion":"Discipline and order must be at the very top of the list and highlighted in bold. Other imperial powers existed and many had advantages over the British but they all ultimately fell short due to a lack of order and discipline. The Spanish, Portuguese, French and to a lesser extent the Dutch all came up short because man for man they couldn't match the British system. It doesn't matter that they built bigger and better ships when we had better sailors. It doesn't matter that they built better and bigger cannon when we had better gunners. It doesn't matter that they built bigger and better crossbows when we had better archers. The list goes on and on. The Spanish might run. The French might fight each other. The Dutch might discuss the situation at length. The British will stand and fight to the last man. I can almost guarantee you with all that I own that were Agincourt to be fought with the odds the other way around neither the Spanish, Portugese or French would have fought that day. They would have retreated, surrendered or paid a tribune. The same might also be said of Trafalgar. I don't believe the British were naturally reckless or audacious. They simply understood what needed to be done, what it involved and that it was their duty to get it done. Whilst the others were complaining and wailing at their commanding officers about the task they had been set the British had already accepted their fate and begun their preparations. I can imagine the pep talk often went along the lines of ‘Lads, It's France’ or ‘Lads, It's Spain’ and that's about all that needed to be said. Whether real or imagined the perception has often been that those nations lacked any real grit and would roll over once it hit the fan. That sort of supriority complex also provided a tremendous mental fortitude that success or death were the only valid options. I'm not sure the French or Spanish ever really thought they would defeat the British on any given day in the same way. You put all that together and order, discipline and mental fortitude really stand out."},{"prompt":"What is the most horrible thing you have seen while in a mental hospital?","completion":"I guess it depends on what you mean, or are asking, by “horrible”. My very first admission I witnessed a male patient put a table through the beverage bay window, after a misunderstanding between him and a bank nurse escalated (the nurse was the one who made it far worse and thought that pushing this guy into the beverage bay and closing the door would somehow help…), which was scary and traumatic for me. I’ve had several incidences of being attacked physically and verbally by other patients, and witnessed patients verbally and/or physically attack other patients and staff. Definitely not pleasant experiences. I’ve been kept in the common area with other patients while machine after machine were run down the corridor to try and revive an older patient who had collapsed - this was horrible to witness on many levels. I’ve witnessed patients running around naked or semi-naked and urinating in inappropriate places. I’m lucky that I have never been on a ward where patients were abused by staff, as these places do exist and I’m sure that is horrible to witness and/or experience. The above is all I can think of at this point, they meet my definition of “horrible” but I’m not sure if they answer your question."},{"prompt":"Did Dracula turn any male people into vampires?","completion":"No. In the book and the movie he never turns men into vampires. Why? Well, he's a man that can have all the beautiful women he wants, so why share it with other male vampires. In Anne Rice Vampire Chronicles, her vampires can't have sex.

The funds in public schools come from property taxes which depends on the status of property in the area. Nedless to say a well-to-do neighborhood will have a school well funded while a poor neighborhood, will be pooerly funded. This results in some schools being “good” and some “bad” in the sense of their maintaince and education quality. As the achievements of these schools is dependent upon the common tests like SATs that check the quality of education imparted in the schools, the poor neighborhoods here too experiences a backlash. As a capitalist system, the US has had the system of 'redlining' neighbourhoods worthy of development and investment and often ignored the already poor communities. Therefore the problem in the education system is a system of class and capitalism.

It is mostly being used for accessibility, security, and privacy depending on your needs. One example is an HTTP proxy that allows you to browse websites anonymously. It hides your own IP address and connects using their own IP. It is also being used to access certain websites or applications with restrictions such as sites that can only be accessed on a specific location. Basically, it works when a client sends the request to the proxy, the proxy will then forward this request to the server. The server will send it back to the proxy and proxy to the client. There is no direct connection between the client and the server. If you are using a browser and would like to use a proxy, you will just need to configure the settings on your browser to connect using the proxy IP and port. There are a number of proxy providers that provide shared and private proxies.

While they share some similarities, there are significant differences between them that make each unique. In this article, we will explore the differences between granite and marble, including their properties, uses, and care requirements. Properties [LINKED_TEXT: Granite] [URL: https://rynestone.in/collections/granite-manufacturers-and-suppliers-in-india] is an igneous rock formed from the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. It is composed of several minerals, including quartz, feldspar, and mica. Granite is known for its durability, strength, and resistance to heat, scratches, and stains. It is available in a wide range of colors and patterns, making it a versatile choice for kitchen countertops, bathroom vanities, and flooring. Marble, on the other hand, is a metamorphic rock formed from the recrystallization of limestone or dolomite. It is composed mainly of calcium carbonate and is known for its unique veining and elegant appearance. While marble is softer and more porous than granite, it can still be used in a variety of applications, such as countertops, flooring, and decorative accents. Uses Granite is a popular choice for kitchen countertops due to its durability, heat resistance, and low maintenance requirements. It is also commonly used for outdoor applications, such as paving stones, pool coping, and fire pits. In addition, granite is a popular choice for bathroom vanities, flooring, and backsplashes. Marble is commonly used for bathroom vanities, fireplace surrounds, and decorative accents such as tabletops and sculptures. Its unique veining and elegant appearance make it a popular choice for high-end homes and commercial buildings. However, due to its softer and more porous nature, it is not recommended for high-traffic areas such as kitchen countertops or outdoor applications. Care requirements Granite is relatively low maintenance and easy to care for. It should be sealed regularly to protect against stains and bacteria, and spills should be wiped up immediately to prevent damage to the surface. Granite can be cleaned with a mild soap and water solution or a granite-specific cleaner. Marble, on the other hand, requires more care and attention. It is more susceptible to scratches, etches, and stains, and should be sealed regularly to protect against damage. Spills should be wiped up immediately, and acidic substances such as vinegar and lemon juice should be avoided. Marble can be cleaned with a mild soap and water solution or a marble-specific cleaner. Conclusion In summary, granite and marble are two popular natural stones used in home decor and construction. While they share some similarities, such as their natural beauty and versatility, they differ significantly in their properties, uses, and care requirements. By understanding these differences, you can make an informed decision when choosing between granite and marble for your next project."},{"prompt":"f a base is stronger than the hydroxide ion, then is it a superbase?","completion":"There can not be any stronger bases in a medium than the proton-accepting form of the medium molecule.

So when you send requests to the internet, they pass through the proxy server and the server handles the requests and also received them for you. This way, your real identity is not exposed, and your activity remains private. How does a proxy server work? By acting as an intermediary between your device and the internet, proxies shunt your direct connection to the web and can enhance your privacy, bypass content filters, and geo-blocked content, among others. A proxy does this and a lot more by sending all requests through the proxy server and process it before forwarding to the web and sending the result back to you. So instead of your computer or phone having direct communication with the server and sending its request, the request is first processed through the proxy’s server before being sent to the target server. This way, you can stay protected as the target server doesn’t see you as the visitor but the visiting proxy IP. So if you are concerned about the information websites to have on you, and want to keep your online activities private, making use of a proxy is a huge step to go about it. Note that not all proxies have equal capacities; the level of privacy and anonymity one would give you may be different from that from another proxy. And so bearing this in mind, you need to make your choice of proxies carefully."},{"prompt":"Bangladesh more powerful and prosperous than Pakistan?","completion":"Bangali are intellectuals n Econimists whether they are in Indian Bengal or Bangladesh.

The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star, Kanye West marrier and mother of North West has a figure envied by millions. It's broken the internet, been dipped in silver paint and starred in a very lucrative sex tape. But are Kim's famous looks 100% natural? Is that bulbous bum as nature intended? What about that ever-changing hairline? Or that lovely button nose? Kim Kardashian first became famous as a socialite pal of Paris Hilton and when you see the before-and-after pictures, which span across seven years, it's hard to believe that it's the same person.

Coming to your question, hacking and cyber forensics are 2 different faces of the same coin, yet both of these are different. Cyber forensics is more related to finding who did the particular act if hacking or an internet based crime,whereas hacking is the case when u do the actual work for one or the other causes. This I would like to explain to you as… Consider a scenario, where you have to get the files related to some small quiz, so here when u get the quiz files from the system which is initially holding it… this would be coming under the part of a hacker and here the hacker can be both a white hat hacker or a black hat one, this really would not make a difference. In the same scenario when some detective or a person looks at the system from which the quiz file was taken and tries to figure out who that was or how the data was taken, this would be under the job role of cyber forensics. I hope the difference between the role of a hacker and that of cyber forensics is clear with you. If there is anything more that you would like me to explain to you, let me know.

In summary, Dil Bechara is anywhere from an okay to good movie that acquires a whole new meaning in its final 20 minutes, dishing out moments that elevate its surreal nature by blurring the lines between fiction and reality. Directed by debutante Mukesh Chhabra, Dil Bechara plays off like a faithful adaptation of John Green’s The Fault In Our Stars, albeit commercializing, or rather Bollywoodizing a few of the novel’s plot points. The character names are Indian and swapped (the girl’s name is two words while the male’s name is three), the lead female’s obsession with an incomplete book changes to one with an unfinished song, the Bollywood hero’s side-kick friend gets typically sidelined and the search for an author is replaced by the search for a musician, both played by big names in their respective film industries. But where The Fault In Our Stars evoked strong emotions nearly throughout, Dil Bechara resorts to cliches and tropes to tide its narrative forward and as a consequence, appears a bit corny at times. Immanuel Rajkumar Junior a.k.a. Manny is our conventional-unconventional, eccentric, larger than life Bollywood hero who believes in living life on the edge, wooing the girl and smiling despite losing his leg to osteosarcoma in a clever conceit that allows Manny to have an illness while saving on VFX budget. Kizie Basu becomes the familiar female lead who battles her cancer cynically at first before she starts enjoying life a bit and warming up to Manny who opens her minds to new perspectives while infecting her with his contagious happy-go-lucky demeanor. Narratively, Dil Bechara comes across as a series of events strung together without much momentum from one to the next. Editing flaws are glaringly visible resulting in some sequences feeling cut short or some arriving out of nowhere (the opening title track and the Paris scenes for instance). A theory doing the rounds is that much of the film was cut resulting in its 1 hour 40 minute run time (brief by Bollywood standards). An extended sequence in Paris sees our leads meet the supposedly charming Abhimanyu Veer only to realize he’s a dickish, snobbish musician who has no definite answers for them. The entire sequence is directed bizarrely with jarring camera angles, off music and an almost unfinished vibe that makes it stick out far more than Saif Ali Khan’s irritating performance. This completely robs the scene of its importance in the story; where it becomes a defining moment for Hazel Grace Lancaster, it just becomes another development that is brushed aside. This isn’t to say the movie doesn’t have any redeeming qualities. A. R. Rahman’s album is breezy and I found the songs endearing, smooth flowing and adding to the film’s romantic and dreamy qualities. It features a strong supporting cast with special kudos to Swastika Mukherjee as Kizie’s mom who portrays a fairly typical, concerned Bengali mother with aplomb, giving her all. Her husband played by Saswata Chatterjee is equally competent yet underutilized, as is evident in his brief outburst over her wife and a memorable scene with Sushant. Another underused actor is Sahil Vaid who shifts his performance gradually as his character goes blind but stands strong by Sushant’s side. The film rests on its two leads, of which Sanjana Sanghi does a fairly okay job, seeing as its her first film. She lacks the experience to bring out some really euphoric emotions at times (watch her tepid reaction to receiving an email response from Veer) but carries both the burden of the oxygen cylinder and her film drudgingly with her. Ultimately, it is Sushant Singh Rajput as Manny who injects a healthy dose of vibrancy to the film, doing his best to bring the director’s vision of a half-baked larger-than-life person to life. As Manny Sushant tries to create a character with his own quirks, shifts his walking mannerism due to an artificial lib and is woefully persistent in wooing Kizie, sometimes to the point of irritation, exuding an annoyance so reminiscent of the 90s heroes. That approach is certainly outdated in today’s times but Sushant fully embraces the character’s high-spirited nature and tries hard to make it work, even delivering a dance number shot in a single, continuous take. And if this were a normal movie, the review would end here. In the weeks leading up to it, we’ve all been following the news and we all know what transpired. Rajput apparently succumbed to suicide (I say apparently because the case is still being investigated). Instead of this being swept under the rug, it ignited a massive wave of conversation over nepotism, character smudging by PR blinds and the film industry’s elite connected in a way that makes any outsider truly breaking through impossible. As things stand, the actor’s demise affects the way profoundly. As much as I hate to admit it, the film acquires a whole new meaning in its final 20 minutes with the revelation that Rajput’s character’s cancer has returned and is now terminal in its final stages. Yep, that’s a spoiler but for a film that’s been seen by 95 million people in its Hotstar premiere, I’ll take that chance. In an almost surreal case of life imitating art, the realization sinks in: we’re watching what would be the final moments of Sushant’s life as an actor, the last new footage that exists of him - in character or otherwise. As Manny passes away, so too will we never see Sushant again. The news of Sushant’s death was so sudden that many couldn’t fully grasp or absorb the impact of it. These moments give you an alternate, if ficitious window into watching the final visuals of an actor now gone. That realization really hits hard, making this section of Dil Bechara quite painful to watch. It’s only exacerbated by the fact that Sushant portrayed Manny as an endearing (if annoying at times) personality and this, coupled with the actor’s real-life demise, latches into our heads as scenes start playing out showing him struggling to come to terms with accepting his fate. The lines start blurring. Did Sushant go through similar struggles of existential crisis in the final few moments? Did he feel as broken down? In those final moments, it does feel like Sushant is talking through the camera to us, revealing his most vulnerable self in plain sight. A scene between him and Kizie’s father is particularly poignant in this regard. Sushant explains how the cancer not just took away his legs but his soul. How his losses and wins won’t matter, how he’d be looked at affectionately because of his “condition” and how that robs him of a shot at fair play at life. And in an almost meta sort of way, the final sequence has the characters gather in a drive-by theater to watch a B-grade film that Kizie and Manny adoringly shot over the course of their time spent together. The characters watching Manny’s posthumous film realizing this is the final footage of Manny they’ll ever see mirrors us watching Dil Bechara with that very same realization. If that realization skips by you, great. If it hits you, it’ll hit you like a brick and you’ll likely find yourself bawling with tears. All of this leaves me with one fleeting, controversial thought. We all know the kind of intelligence that Sushant carried. What if, in his life’s final moments, he somehow imagined that Dil Bechara would resonate hard with fans after he’s gone? That his death would immortalize his character? That it would add a whole new dimension to what would otherwise be slammed as a run-of-the-mill Bollywood film?

He actually expected to get the loyalty of Sansa and the North by selling her to the North's biggest traitors. The prospect of Sansa being raped by Ramsay was too much for D&D to pass up so they had LF sell her to the Boltons for… reasons. I've seen that people have said LF did it so Cersei would name him Warden of the North once he brought the KotV to defeat the Boltons but they almost always leave out the most important part of that conversation. Cersei would only name him Warden if he killed Sansa and brought her Sansa's head. He was never going to be named Warden by Cersei so that being used as a reason for him doing it has never made any sense. It has never been explained because there is no explanation and D&D knew it. Sansa said how could he protect her as he stated by selling her to Boltons. LF asked to speak to her alone so he could explain everything but that was never going to happen which is why D&D felt comfortable with him asking. It's similar to that stupid “light the candle” plan that Brienne had with Sansa as a signal to rescue her which was never going to happen because they knew she would turn away to go and kill Stannis.

Yet some hotels give stars to themselves, basically for marketing purpose.

TM is often associated with the teachings of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, who introduced the technique to the western world in the 1950s. While TM does charge for instruction, it is not solely focused on making money. The fees charged by TM are used to cover the costs of training and supporting teachers, as well as funding research and outreach programs. TM has been the subject of numerous scientific studies, and there is evidence to suggest that it may have various benefits for mental and physical health, including reducing stress, anxiety, and depression, improving focus and concentration, and lowering blood pressure. While some critics argue that the fees charged by TM are too high, proponents argue that the benefits of the practice justify the cost.

Probably to do with the fact that all humans ancestry, including that of Indo-Iranians derived from Africa. So it’s a logical deduction that the further and further in the past you look, the more this would be apparent. Even after tens of thousands of years after leaving Africa, humans still had darkskin, and in some cases light eyes. (Fact: The popularity of light skin among humans has steadily increased since 6000 B.C, and human beings are still getting lighter to this day thanks to sexual selection.) Diverse range of skin types in Ancient West Asia: Some people will call this observation, ‘Afrocentric’ but it’s got nothing to do with modern politics. It’s simply the truth of the matter. No matter how we flip the coin, the outcome is that modern human being is a uniquely African phenomena. And this is proven by the extremely diverse and ancient DNA among modern day Africans.

How it pleaded with me the advantages Agastya ( which is his name) would have on eating it, the health benefits it would cause him so on and so forth.

Given the massive energy release of a nuclear device, even a very small “rocket” with a nuclear detonation in the chamber would have to be several hundred meters in radius, a rather impractical approach, so the developers of ORION looked at external propulsion; detonating a nuclear device coated in some material which would be “flung” at the spacecraft at high velocity, transferring momentum to the spacecraft and propelling it. This was obviously very inefficient, so the idea underwent continual refinement, with the final versions using a highly engineered “pulse unit” to transmit the energy of the nuclear device to to spacecraft. Orion nuclear pulse unit The nuclear explosion releases most of its energy in the form of a spherical wave of X ray radiation. The “Radiation case” is built out of an x-ray opaque material (in this case U-238) with a single aperture for the X ray radiation to flow out of in the microseconds before the pulse unit is vapourized. The radiation heats material in the channel filler, which in turn heats a propellant material (in this case Tungsten) to plasma temperatures and fires it at the spacecraft. The spaceship intercepts the plasma with a “pusher plate” and the momentum is transferred to the spacecraft via a series of shock absorbers. Classic ORION spacecraft ORION is still the only system known which combines both high thrust and high ISP. However, the idea of launching multi thousand ton spacecraft from Earth using a stream of nuclear explosions created some…..concern…. and the nuclear test ban treaty of 1963 effectively killed ORION in that form. However, the lure of high thrust, high ISP drive continues to attract attention, and while the classic idea of an ORION spacecraft blasting off from Jackass flats on a pillar of nuclear fire is no longer under consideration, alternatives have been sought. Some ideas, like “[LINKED_TEXT: Mini Mag] [URL: http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist2.php#minimagorion]” ORION seek to reduce the amount fo nuclear fuel needed by using exotic techniques to crush sub critical masses of fission fuel to release energy and capturing it in a magnetic field rather than a physical pusher plate. Many nuclear fusion proposals incorporate [LINKED_TEXT: Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF)] [URL: http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist2.php#icfusion] fusion, triggering tiny fusion explosions at a high rate at the focus of a magnetic nozzle using lasers or ion beams. The main issue here is no one has yet succeeded in demonstrating ICF, much less at high repetition rates. Dedalus, a conceptual ICF rocket An interesting aside was the British Interplanetary Society study called “[LINKED_TEXT: Medusa] [URL: http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist2.php#medusa]”, which turned the concept around and had a “tractor” configuration with a huge “parachute” or sail to capture the momentum of the nuclear plasma. Given sufficient distance, this would be far more efficient than the classic ORION, being able to capture far more energy with a much lighter structure. The overall mass of the spacecraft would also be far less since the need for massive pusher plates and shock absorbers would have been eliminated as well. Since space is already a high radiation environment, the crew capsule would be protected from the additional radiation of the exploding nuclear devices, and have additional protection from being tens to hundreds of kilometres behind the sail.

The process of transferring a domain name is quick — if you have everything prepared, then your portion of the process should only take a couple of hours, max. Your registrar must finalize the transfer process, and typically, that should take no longer than 5-7 business days. How much does it cost to transfer a domain name? ICANN, the organization that oversees domains, requires that a one-year extension be added to domains when they're transferred to a new registrar. Some registrars charge an additional fee on top of the standard one-year extension (renewal) fee. However, some registrars don’t. At Domain.com, domain transfers are free. That means no fees in addition to the required 1-year renewal charge. What do I need to transfer my domain name? The [LINKED_TEXT: process of transferring a domain name] [URL: https://www.domain.com/help/article/domain-transfer-how-to-transfer-a-domain-to-your-account?utm_source=social&utm_medium=quora] is largely the same across most registrars.

Your domain name must be valid and registered with a different registrar.Your domain name must be registered for at least 60 days and unlocked.Your Admin contact information must be up-to-date.You've obtained your transfer authorization code (also known as an EPP code).

Some registrars insist on this for security purposes.Your domain must be registered for at least 60 days.In the domain industry, it's standard practice to lock a domain for 60 days post-registration.

Dofollow backlinks are links that search engines will follow when crawling a webpage, and therefore they pass link equity or \\"link juice\\" from the linking webpage to the linked webpage. In other words, dofollow backlinks can positively impact the linked webpage's search engine rankings. On the other hand, nofollow backlinks are links that are designed to tell search engines not to follow or pass any link equity to the linked webpage. They are created by adding a rel=\\"nofollow\\" attribute to the link. Nofollow links do not have any impact on the linked webpage's search engine rankings. In general, dofollow backlinks are more valuable for improving search engine rankings, but it's important to have a mix of both dofollow and nofollow backlinks in your link profile for a more natural-looking backlink profile. Additionally, nofollow backlinks can still bring valuable referral traffic"},{"prompt":"What are the differences between those who succeed slowly and those who succeed fast?","completion":"Smart work and hard work is the difference."},{"prompt":"the Big Whisper theory using the same scientific facts as the Big Bang theory a good alternative?","completion":"I think that any theory where so much of the “semantic” difference with another theory is the wording is really going to be the same theory. I can’t easily find anything on line describing this particular theory, other than a self-reflection back to Quora, that led to a “dubious” web site reference. Having said that what I read from Quora reference seems to be reasonable. Perhaps I can simplify what the problem is. No one is doubting the “consequences” of cosmic inflation.The problem is in three parts.The details of that “inflation” - basically how the universe is inflating, and why it did not collapse back on itself because of gravity.What would be the end result of that inflation? Would the universe later on collapse back on itself in a Big Crunch? Would it continue to expand? Or would it gradually just reduce its rate of expansion?And “what happened” just BEFORE inflation but AFTER the singularity? It is this problem that is the most “open ended”.Because of the nature of “singularities” and questions about “existence”, there are many possible variations on the basic theory like this. The truth is that both “big bang” and “big whisper” have semantic connotations that are not helpful in any way to “understanding”. We can even see this in the alternative set of theories, called “steady state”. So far we do not have any evidence at all that we can account for cosmic inflation with “microbangs”making the original “debunked” theory of Hoyle into a still valid “modified steady state” theory. And to be honest, whenever physicists start talking too much about “dark matter” that can’t be observed or “cosmological constants” to explain something e.g. inflation, we can see they are getting desperate for “elegance” in their theory. As far as I can see, it is still basically the same theory. The universe is still “begining” as looking like it is very hot and very dense. We see hear the “bang” of the cosmic background radiation."},{"prompt":"it true that TCS is going to do a permanent work from home?","completion":"Nothing can be said about any company, be it TCS or any other IT company.

I understand the historical reasons for an electoral college but communication systems are now much better!","completion":"The only Americans that want this are die-hard Democrats. The problem with it is that if we had this then the only votes that matter are going to be people in giant states like California, Texas, and Florida. Billy Joe Bob in Alabama’s opinion won’t matter. This is exactly what the Founding Fathers did not want. The United States is not a democracy and it’s not supposed to be. Technically, you are a citizen of your state and not of the United States. While we all call ourselves Americans, you’re supposed to be a Californian, a Texan, a New Yorker, etc. Because of this, it’s the state that elects the President, not the people. Technically, if your state told you to go pound sand and that the governor alone will cast the ballot for the entire state that’s actually allowed. None of them actually do this of course but it’s not unconstitutional. The reason for this is not because communication methods in the 18th century were not good, the reason is that the founders didn’t want a situation where the citizens of one gigantic state would dictate the policy for the entire country."},{"prompt":"w can I improve my Quora writing skills?","completion":"Having good English communication skills is necessary across many industries and job roles.

That said, 3 days might not be the best term to determine whether or not something is a good fit for you. Maybe you want to give it at least a couple of weeks to determine whether or not the job is a good fit for you. Maybe things will change once you get to know the company’s systems, once you know how and why they do things the way they do. But that said: as an employer, if someone doesn’t like working for me, I’d rather know sooner than later. If it’s a small business, maybe you can talk to the owner and say “I don’t think things are working out.” Maybe there are issues that you can work out. But if it’s a big company, and you don’t like it…probably a pretty small chance of working out the differences.

Location, Location, Location Location can make or break your first date. Unless you have a particular activity in mind, Chantelle recommends choosing somewhere that is relaxed and not too niche. “An extravagant dinner date to kick things off can be a little intense for some, but a walk by the beach or a casual meal at the pub can ensure you’re able to get to know the person and a casual setting. Think of a location that can fuel connection, intimacy and drive conversation and always remember to choose locations that make you feel safe and comfortable,” she said. Other places to try include a bar or a coffee shop, as they can have a nice vibe and are the perfect places to have long, uninterrupted conversations. It’s best to avoid fancy restaurants and super-romantic locations on your first date, as it can make it feel high-pressure or like you’re already on your 67th date! A bar of a coffee shop also makes it easy to leave after one drink if you’re not feeling it. Or, if you’re hitting it off, you have the option to stay for a few more drinks. 2. Get Your Mind Right Getting your head in the right place before your first date can be the hardest part. You need to approach the date confidently, but ensure you’re not acting too cocky. The best way to approach the first date mentally is by treating it as you would meeting any person for the first time, but getting your mind right can be harder still. Luckily, Chantelle has a few tips to help get the edge off. “If you are dipping your toe back into the dating game, it can be super nerve-wracking to get on a dating app and even more so, to organise a meeting up in in-person. If you feel like this, you’re not alone, Bumble actually did some research on this at the end of last year – they called it the rise of the cautious dater, and it’s not surprising that many Aussies feel a sense of anxiety about dating, particularly post-pandemic,” she said. “The best way to get in the right mindset before a date is to make time for you in the lead-up. Make a pre-date playlist, take your time getting ready – wearing something that makes you feel amazing will arm you with the right energy for your date. If you are still feeling nervous – fake it until you make it! Chances are, your date is feeling the same way.” Meeting new people is exciting and nothing to be nervous about. If you get along, great. If not, well, at least you got to meet someone new and had some interesting conversations. 3. Learn, But Don’t Reminisce Learning about someone involves sharing stories and delving into the past. Keeping this in mind, one of the best first date tips is to avoid reminiscing about the past while on your first date, especially if previous relationships are part of the stories! That being said, it’s always great to learn from the past, but does practice make perfect? Yes. “It is always good to learn from your past dates – I am a big fan of practice makes perfect, in every aspect of the dating experience. If you find yourself on a date that is going less than perfectly – it doesn’t matter! If anything, when it’s all over you’ll have a great story to tell your friends. The more you allow yourself to step outside of your comfort zone, the more prepared you’ll feel for your next date,” said Otten. “It’s also important to remember that rejection sucks and it’s painful but it can happen. Look at it as an opportunity rather than a setback. No need to waste your time on people who don’t like you as much as you like them or vice versa. Keep moving baby.” Share stories from your past but keep them brief and end them with a question, so your date has the opportunity to engage. 4. Give a quick and cool hello. Even if you and your date text all the time, the first moment of a real-life date can be the scariest part— so much buildup! Keep your cool and calm their jitters by giving them a warm hi and a quick hello hug. When they see how cool you're playing it, not only will they be impressed, but they'll also start to calm down too. Another way to diffuse the awkwardness is by making a joke (\\"Full disclosure: I changed three times!\\"). They'll realize you don't take yourself too seriously and once you guys get a good laugh in together, you'll be ready to start the night and have some fun. 5. Keep the convo moving. First dates can sometimes feel like a job interview. Both parties are trying to gain all the info they can on each other, and the back and forth questioning can seem insincere. It's totally normal to want to know everything about the person you're on a date with, but just realize that's going to take some time. Instead of shooting questions at your date, ask them one and then let a conversation build from there. If they love rap music, start discussing that! Don't just move on to the next question on your list."},{"prompt":"there a way to permanently delete files on a computer where even the FBI can't find the info?","completion":"If you are done with the hard drive, drive holes through it multiple times.

Typically, their responsibilities within a research and development project in an IT company include: Defining the project scopeConducting business researchGathering project requirementsCreating requirements specificationsTranslating requirements to the teamPerforming acceptance testing 1. Defining the project scope A business analyst should define the ultimate vision of what the project should look like early on, effectively limiting the scope of development. A precisely defined project scope will help the team prioritize features in order to deliver a minimum viable product as early as possible instead of spending time on secondary and nice-to-have features. 2. Conducting business research In order to determine the scope of the project and gather all necessary requirements, a BA also needs to research information related to the project. This can include: competitor researchdocument analysisbrainstormingprototypingother research methods Elicitation allows an analyst to gain a clear understanding of business needs related to the project, thus facilitating requirements gathering. 3. Gathering project requirements Requirements gathering takes a unique blend of communication skills and technical expertise that simply cannot be found in anyone other than a BA. A BA carefully evaluates the needs of stakeholders based on their objectives and concerns. This is where business analysts apply their facilitation skills. They need to ask the correct questions to find the root cause of the issue and an appropriate solution that will meet everybody’s needs. To do that, the BA has to understand how stakeholders expect the system to work and formulate requirements based on those expectations. By acting as a bridge between stakeholders and developers, the business analyst brings an understanding of not only how the work needs to be done but why it needs to be done in that particular way. There are various ways to get this information, from analyzing documentation to interviews and surveys. 4. Creating requirements specifications After requirements have been gathered, the next step is to formalize them by creating a written specification. [LINKED_TEXT: Software requirements specification] [URL: https://www.apriorit.com/white-papers/706-srs-development] plays an important role in software engineering. This document can be shared with stakeholders. Writing a specification demands a specific set of skills and technologies that will make the requirements clear to stakeholders and useful to developers. Besides requirements specifications, a BA may provide mockups or wireframes of new features. This is a great benefit to the team because developers don’t have to think about the design themselves. 5. Translating requirements to the team After a requirements specification is written and reviewed by stakeholders, it needs to be presented to the development team. The team has to understand all the requirements and get answers to any questions they might have. A BA’s success in communicating information largely depends on the way they understand the team, their strong and weak points, and their understanding of the business domain. 6. Performing acceptance testing When a feature is implemented, the BA needs to check whether it meets all requirements. In order to do this, acceptance testing is usually performed at the last stages of feature development. Passing acceptance testing signifies the product is complete and ready to be released. In addition, it’s a common practice for business analysts on Agile projects to show a demo at the end of every sprint. The demo is presented to stakeholders to show them the workflow and progress within the sprint. While we’ve covered the gist of what business analysts do, there’s much more to the role. To get an idea of how many tasks are actually involved in a BA’s day-to-day job, check out this great [LINKED_TEXT: infographic] [URL: http://thebusinessanalystjobdescription.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Business-Analyst-Job-Descr..png] that provides a summary of a business analyst job description.

What is the greatest team to not win that years championship, and what is the greatest era of a team that did not produce a championship? (The bitter disappointment of not winning) The best team to ever finish second has a clear cut favourite. No disrespect to theShowtime Lakers and Bird’s Celtics, who notably finished as runners up a combined 6 times and Isiah’s Pistons who came so close to winning in ’88 before winning in ‘89. The ’13 Spurs probably came the closest to having the trophy before it was tragically ripped away by the Miami Heatles. It has to be the 2015–16 Golden State Warriors. People seem to have forgotten their story. After LeBron’s monster Finals performance and Durant’s addition, the narrative became “the Warriors needed Durant”. Now, obviously them winning this season has changed that but lets quickly recap: 2014–15: 67–15 regular season record. 1st in defensive rating, second in offensive rating. Many basketball commentators were apprehensive about their chances of winning a title. Remember, in 2015 people still hadn’t gotten over the classic “Jump shooting teams can’t win championships” maxim. This was also the season after the Spurs had won the title in dominant fashion, with Kawhi to take the next step in becoming a super star, AND LeBron going to Cleveland to team up with Kyrie and Kevin Love. They win the title and immediately got slung with the qualifier “it was against an injured Cavs team”. Not to say it isn’t true, but this was the impetus for the Warriors to come FIRING the next season. Que Stephen Curry to win the first, and only, ever unanimous MVP, torching the NBA for 30 points a night with 50,45 and 90 splits. The Warriors win 73 games in dominant fashion, including an astonishing 24–0 start to the season. They blew out the Cavs and Spurs, the nearest title contenders, by 30+ points back to back. They seemed absolutely untouchable, and had they won the title there would have been some fierce debate about them being the greatest team ever. The greatest era of a team? There are a few stand outs: The Jazz in the 90s were a perenially 50+ game win team, led by two players in the 5 best ever in their position. They got to 2 Finals in a stacked Western Conference. They had to battle against Olajuwon’s champion Rockets, Payton and Kemps Supersonics, the young Kobe and Shaq Lakers and the Spurs with David Robinson. Had it not been for the dominance of the Bulls, one of the greatest ever teams, they might have a ring or two. We also tend to forget the 7 Seconds or Less Suns. They had everything with the one-two punch of Nash and Stoudemire, in the model of Malone and Stockton. They had a star player in Shawn Marion and played a new style of up-tempo basketball that caught the NBA by surprise, and are credited with changing the NBA forever with their three point barrages. The best team for me has to be the 60s Lakers. Elgin Baylor and Jerry West were two of the five best players of the whole DECADE on the same team. They went to 7 Finals together, losing 6 to the Russell Celtics and once to the Knicks. Making 7 Finals without winning has to qualify them as the best of the rest, separating themselves from the other perpetual runner ups."},{"prompt":"Prince Harry says he and Meghan won't return to the UK.

Let's say you need a roofer to repair your roof. You look through many reviews and narrow your search down to two roofers. They're both equally highly rated. You call each roofer individually. In each conversation you describe the situation of your roof (e.g. it's a gable roof, made of shingles, has a few leaks, etc.), and you ask each roofer how much they charge and what their thoughts are. They both charge the same amount, and the only difference between them as far as you can tell is: Roofer A says he has dealt with your type of roof problem COUNTLESS times. He knows EXACTLY what to do. It should be a simple repair - done in 3 days MAX or your money back.Roofer B says he has dealt with the problem several times. It shouldn't be too much of an issue, and he can probably do it in 4 days, given that it doesn't rain. Well, so, you pick Roofer A and.... HE DOES A GREAT JOB!!! He even fixes the problem in 1 day. You're thrilled. It turns out that Roofer A is also a really genuine, friendly, person and you guys have several common interests such as bocce ball and beach body building. You pay Roofer A a good tip and recommend him to all your friends with gable roofs. (Almost all your friends have gable roofs.) But what if Roofer B would have actually done a better job? What if: Roofer B actually has 10 more years of experience than Roofer A, has actually fixed your particular roof problem 20 times before, AND would have used a higher quality tar compound that you know nothing aboutRoofer A actually only encountered your roof problem 11 times before (and he lost count after 4)And both roofers could have fixed your roof problem in 5 hours. Roofer A just took a little longer than that because you and him kept talking about bocce ball strategy At the time of making your decision, all the knowledge you had to base your decision on was how each roofer came across in the phone conversation, because reading the online reviews had already led you to the indecisive conclusion that they were both highly reviewed roofers. From the phone call, Roofer A sounded like he knew what he was doing more so than Roofer B. So you picked Roofer A. I would have too. So you didn't know that Roofer B was actually better for the job. And guess what? YOU NEVER WILL. And neither would your interviewer, grad-school-admissions-person-reviewing-your-application, or could've-been-future-spouse know how great you could've been instead of the Roofer A that they chose. Arguably, confidence shapes everything others can initially perceive about you: the way you talk, your body language, the words you use, etc. Neither roofers lied. They were both telling the truth, and they were both competent. Confidence (or the lack-of) is also cyclical: Roofer A will now get more opportunities and new business thrown his way because you loved the great job he did and you are going to recommend him to all your friends that have gable roofs (and even friends that have hip roofs!) When for some reason Roofer A fails, it also won't get to him as much because he'll think about it, make a mental note of lessons learned, and blame the rest on the roof (because that particular roof really was a rare problem), and then continue succeeding (because Roofer A is also an [LINKED_TEXT: optimist] [URL: https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-unfair-advantage-a-person-can-have/answer/None]).Roofer B will start to doubt himself for why he didn't win your business. He'll continue to get roofing jobs, but he might also bump into a roof that is un-fixable. He'll think about it, blame himself, and won't be able to get past it. He'll start to think that maybe he's a terrible roofer and quit his calling altogether. Three months later on your morning jog, you find him under the bridge downtown, wearing a hoodie, drinking a 40, listening to [LINKED_TEXT: RHCP] [URL: http://www.quora.com/Red-Hot-Chili-Peppers-band/What-is-your-favourite-RHCP-song-and-is-there-a-reason-for-inclination-to-it-compared-to-other-song/answer/Sam-Harris-13?srid=tHVN&share=1]. A tragic outcome. In the example above, both roofers were equally competent, but one was more confident. In reality, getting confidence is not easy and requires a lot of hard work, experience, and competence. Here's a great article about it: [LINKED_TEXT: How to Develop Unshakeable Self Confidence] [URL: http://www.caseinterview.com/self-confidence-vs-esteem]. Also, people who are confident when they are not competent are dangerous, because others will trust them even though they are leading people off of a cliff. A more realistic example involving confidence might be MBA school interviews. At some schools, there is an interview process in which about half of those that are invited to interview are admitted. The overall admission rate might be less than 10%, but to the overjoyed person who gets the interview invitation, that rate now looks like 50%. The school might be thinking that they have gleaned all they could from the paper applications, so they've selected their top candidates for interview. So at the interview stage, everyone is sort of on equal ground, and as the person being interviewed, you now have 30-45 minutes to make a good impression. Guess what's kind of important in that short span of time: CONFIDENCE. (Note: I know very little about grad school admissions and therefore I wasn't very confident in writing the above paragraph; I used words such as \\"might\\", \\"sort of\\", \\"about\\", and that has led you to be less confident about everything you just read. The above did happen to me though, and I wasn't admitted, and it hurt.)"},{"prompt":"the UK, can a resident get him/herself checked (e.g. blood tests, scans) for cancer free of charge on NHS?

Of course. Can a GP refuse to arrange these checks because the client has no symptoms? If you have no symptoms, and nothing else to suggest that you might have cancer, why would you expect resources to be wasted on arbitrarily giving you expensive, labour-intensive tests? There are people out there who do have symptoms and do have things to suggest that they might have cancer, and who need checks because qualified, competent medical professionals think it’s necessary, and you want them to get in line behind you; someone who wants tests just for fun? Healthcare works like this: You have a problemYou go to a doctor and tell him or her about the problemThey investigate, ask you further questions if necessaryThey make a diagnosis and tell you how to manage it, and maybe prescribe you some medication that helps.If it’s not as simple as that, they may refer you to someone or somewhere else - another specialist doctor, a hospital, whatever for tests and checks. You don’t diagnose yourself, and you don’t tell your doctor what you want to be tested for. They diagnose you, and they decide what (if anything) to test you for, because they’re doctors and they studied for years, maybe decades and have throughout their training and subsequent careers been constantly scrutinised and made to demonstrate that they know what they’re talking about.

I think I have cancer - book me in for a full physical exam, a blood test, a urine test, an ultrasound, an MRI scan, an x-ray, and a biopsy!”"},{"prompt":"What exercise can lose face fat?","completion":"Whether it’s our stomach, arms, thighs or cheeks, most of us have wished that we could lose a little body fat from some part of the body at some point in our lives. It is a common desire to lose some fat from the cheeks and overall face to change the overall appearance. Well, losing body fat does require making different kinds of long-term changes to your lifestyle and diet. Read along to learn about the best strategies that you may follow to reduce some of those stubborn face fat: Overall weight loss: Losing weight overall can help reduce face fat. Try creating a calorie deficit in your body by consuming lesser calories than you burn. You may attain this by combining regular exercises with a balanced and healthy diet. Stay hydrated: Drinking an adequate amount of water can help prevent water retention and bloating in the face. It is important to drink at least 8-9 glasses of water every day. Cardiovascular exercises: Engage in regular aerobic exercises such as jogging, cycling or swimming. These activities help burn calories and contribute to overall weight loss, including the reduction of face fat. Facial exercises: Specific exercises can help tone the muscles in your face and reduce face fat. Some exercises include cheek lifts, blowing air into balloons and chewing gum to work the muscles around the jawline. Healthy diet: Consume a well-balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins and healthy fats. Avoid or limit processed foods, sugary drinks, and foods high in sodium, as they can contribute to bloating and water retention. Facial massage: Gentle facial massages can improve blood circulation, reduce fluid retention and give your face a more toned appearance. Use your fingertips to massage your face in circular motions, starting from the chin and moving upwards. Limit alcohol and salt intake: Excessive alcohol consumption and high sodium intake can lead to facial bloating and puffiness. Limit your alcohol intake and avoid high-sodium foods to reduce water retention in the face. It is important to note that the distribution of fat in the body is largely determined by genetics, so it is important to set realistic expectations. It is not possible to target fat loss in specific areas, but by adopting a healthy lifestyle overall, you can reduce overall body fat, which will include a reduction in face fat."},{"prompt":"Do all UK people say they speak “English” and not “British English”?","completion":"Do all UK people say they speak “English” and not “British English”?

I have observed this many times, successfull submission count at Codechef hitting in 100’s within first 3–4 minute itself for CookOff and LunchTime.CookOff and LunchTime are short duration contest unlike LongChallenge.The evaluation of a participant’s score is not only based on accuracy but also on the time he/she submitted the solution. The earlier he/she submits, the higher the score will be. The first question at CookOff and LunchTime is always a cakewalk problem. It is deliberately added by authors to warm up the contestants. Even if you read the question slowly any newbie coder would be able to come up with the solution. The solution for such cakewalk questions require simple math or array manipulation.The top coders (at platforms like Codechef, Spoj or Codeforces) have been competing at such short-duration contest from years. They would have solved 100’s of questions on the Codechef itself (and 100’s more at other platforms like Codeforces, Spoj and TopCoder)With such massive experience, the top coders already knew the solution for cakewalk problem. They had already faced the same cakewalk problems (or its variants) 100’s of time before. They had reached at such tipping point, where they don’t need to think for the solution, because it is already been memorizedMost of the top competitive coders maintain a ready-template of their programming language , like the one below usually followed for C++. So, when a cakewalk problem comes up, due to above mentioned point, a top coder would need to type 2 or 3 lines of code #include <bits/stdc++.h> using namespace std; int main() { int number_of_testcases, ans; cin>>number_of_testcases; while(number_of_testcases--){ //add the problem specific solution here cout<<ans<<endl; } return 0; } 5. So, now our top competitive coder reads the short description of a cakewalk problem within a minute. The problem triggers a solution in his/her mind. He/She types that 2–3 line solution in his/her template, copies the content to submit editor on Codechef and hits Submit! Hence, you see that submission count around 100–200 within first 3–5 minutes. On a side note:Even if the cakewalk problem is new to the coder, solution for such problem can be easily imagined within first 2 minutes. Many of the competitive coders are touch typist. Touch typing saves time while coding. Touch typist never peep into keyboard while typing. I suggest learn touch typing.It’s the same principle we apply while using IDE’s. If we are going to use a tool like an IDE for a long amount of time, it’s better to learn its shortcuts. You can apply this same principle for learning touch typing. If we are going to use a tool like keyboard for software development for majority of time duration of our career then it is better to learn touch typing as it saves TIME!.

This guide will provide you with valuable tips and strategies to help you find the cheapest flights and hotels, ensuring that you save money without compromising on comfort or quality. 1. Be Flexible with Travel Dates: One of the key factors in finding affordable flights and hotels is flexibility. Avoid peak travel seasons and consider traveling during weekdays instead of weekends. By being open to adjusting your travel dates, you increase your chances of finding better deals as airlines and hotels often offer lower prices during off-peak periods. 2. Compare Multiple Travel Websites: Don't settle for the first flight or hotel option you come across. Take advantage of online travel websites that allow you to compare prices across different airlines and accommodations. Websites like Skyscanner, Kayak, Expedia, and [LINKED_TEXT: Booking.com: The largest selection of hotels, homes, and vacation rentals] [URL: http://booking.com/] are great platforms to start your search. Comparing prices will give you a clear idea of what's available and help you find the most affordable options. 3. Sign Up for Price Alerts: Many travel websites and airlines offer price alert services, allowing you to receive notifications when there are significant price drops or promotions. By subscribing to these alerts, you can stay updated on the latest deals and snatch up discounted flights and hotel rooms as soon as they become available. 4. Utilize Incognito Browsing: When searching for flights and hotels, use private or incognito browsing mode in your web browser. This prevents travel websites from tracking your search history and raising prices based on your repeated searches. Incognito mode helps you see more accurate pricing information and prevents potential price manipulation. 5. Consider Alternative Airports and Accommodations: Expanding your search to include nearby airports or alternative accommodations can significantly reduce costs. Check if there are budget airlines operating from secondary airports near your destination. Additionally, consider options like vacation rentals or guesthouses instead of traditional hotels. These alternatives often offer lower prices and can provide a unique and authentic travel experience. 6. Book in Advance: Generally, booking your flights and hotels well in advance can result in better deals. Airlines and hotels tend to increase their prices as the departure or check-in dates approach. By booking early, you can secure lower rates and have peace of mind knowing that your travel arrangements are in place. 7. Be Open to Connecting Flights: Direct flights are often more convenient but can be more expensive. If you're willing to make a stopover or take connecting flights, you can often find cheaper options. Explore different airlines and flight routes to see if there are affordable options with layovers. Similarly, if you have the time, consider longer layovers as they can sometimes be an opportunity to explore a new city at no additional cost. 8. Consider Package Deals: Sometimes, booking flights and hotels together as part of a package can save you money. Travel agencies or online platforms often offer discounted rates when you book your entire trip, including flights and accommodation, in one go. Take the time to compare the prices of individual bookings versus package deals to see which option offers the most significant savings.

Just be sure to try and pick a good one by requesting a free sample. Your dissertation is a necessary evil; so is having to schedule a time for your defense that fits every committee member. Or finishing every homework assignment and exam. It’s just one of the things on your graduation checklist. There’s no way around it, but most likely you will only have to do it once in your lifetime. And the thing is, your writing can’t be improved overnight. It’s a long term process that takes passion, hard work and patience. So it may be a little too late to try to improve your dissertation writing while you are already writing it. Even if you do manage to improve it quickly, unless you plan to go into academia or pursue a career in writing, your academic writing skills probably won’t be that important to you. And trust me: you won’t be known for your dissertation, just like you won’t be known for your homework assignments.

The Jews claim to be descendants of Abram. The Brahmins of India say they came from Bramha.","completion":"This question is based on the fallacy of false equivalents based on phonics. Abraham translated literally, means “father of a multitude.”Sarah means noblewoman or princess. They are the mythical ancestors of the Jewish people, and since the Christians and Muslims adopted aspects of the Jewish religion and modified it to suit their purposes they too claim Abraham and Sarah as their progenitors. Brahmā comes from the Sanskrit root Brh and means “Great” and refers to the Principle of creation.Sarasvati means “she-who-flows” and refers to knowledge, information and data – the means by which her consort Brahmā creates the multiple universes. The one couple is the mythical ancestors of the monotheists and the other the mythical generators of the entire Universe with its multiple galaxies and dimensions. So there is absolutely no connection between them. This reminds me of a real time situation that arose when an Australia visited Egypt. He took a taxi from the airport to the hotel and offered the driver a 200 pound note. The driver said fish-fakka (which means “I have no change”) the Australian thought it was a novel way of swearing and so he began to abuse the driver with very colourful Aussies curses, the concierge noting the impasse gently explained to the Aussie what the confusion was about the similar sounding phrase. So we need to learn the meaning of words before drawing conclusions - otherwise we could embarrass ourselves and cause offence."},{"prompt":"What are your silly little parenting tricks that you're so glad you discovered?","completion":"My v young daughter was fixated to having only two rotis per meal.

Presenting such a mob of troglodytes with a well-researched book about Donald Trump is at best casting pearls before swine; they are going to chew it up without any consideration whatsoever and turn it into filth they can wallow in. That being said, the various revelations by General Wiley including that he is willing to go on the record comparing Trump to Hitler and believed the danger of an attempted coup was a real possibility should be sobering in the extreme to any reasonable adult; if you are not alarmed by the threat Trump and his cult embody, you are not paying attention.

Most of you may remember this image. It is a grisly, iconic, Pulitzer Prize-winning photo from the Vietnam War that shocked the world. My eyes were always strangely drawn to the Executioner, General Nguyen Ngoc Loan. The blend of his menacing face, the nonchalance in shooting the man, one must wonder, what leads a person down this path to villainy? How could one so quickly kill a bound, unarmed prisoner? Upon my further investigation - this might be one of the most misunderstood photos in history. The plainly dressed victim might resemble a normal pedestrian - but he was no ordinary prisoner. He was the leader of a Vietcong death squad, that had infiltrated Saigon with the express purpose of assassinating a long list of people. He had personally executed several military officers and their entire families. He was found standing over a grave with 34 bodies in it, that included women and children that had been killed execution style. Following this famous photo, Loan continued fighting in the war for several years. He was later injured, losing one leg. Loan and his wife eventually escaped to the US. Where he had 5 children and owned a restaurant in Virginia. But his life was haunted by the photo that was taken of him as he was held up as a standard bearer for the evils of war. Loan's property was frequently vandalized and he was targeted by various outlets over the years. The photographer, Eddie Adams, was deeply regretful of ever having taken the picture. He knew Loan well and stated that he was a good man and misrepresented. Adams felt he captured two deaths in that photo: that of the victim and that of Loan. And - to be clear - this answer is not an attempt to absolve this man of all blame. This is dark stuff. However, what Loan did was not far beyond the bounds of what other soldiers were doing. War is and has always been hell. To pretend it is anything less is to pretend fire isn't hot. So before making demons of men, remember: given the wrong circumstances, we are all capable of terrible things. After all, we are human."},{"prompt":"What was your reason for leaving a tremendous tip at a restaurant?","completion":"When I lived out in Denver, my wife and I would walk the 16th Street mall regularly. As we sometimes did, we stopped and ate at one of the restaurants. We ate at Chilis that day, and we got our normal dishes. We were sitting near our server, and it was a slow period of the day (it was after the lunch rush, but before the dinner rush). When she wasn't taking care of us (or other tables), she was rolling up silverware into napkins. It was clear that she wasn't having a good day, and it showed by how she rolled the silverware. We chatted with her, and learned that she was having family issues, along with going through school and was pregnant. Having two young kids ourselves, who weren't with us at that time, we empathized with her. While it was clear she was having a tough time, interacting with her as a server, one would never tell. We were both impressed at how well she was able to do that, with everything going on, and still keep a smile on her face. While our order was small (around 30), we ended up tipping 40 in cash, directly to her, wishing her luck, and how impressed we were with her professionalism.

Typing in commands into the command prompt might look tedious, but you can then copypaste them and/or save them into a text file (usually called a “script”), and use this text file to repeat the same set of actions again and again. You can use that text file to easily perform the same action across a thousand of servers. There are tools to automate the GUI tasks in a similar way, but they are nowhere near as reliable or easy to use. You can also easily reuse most of a previous command if only one thing (such as the name of the file) changed, no such option with a GUI. Imagine you need to zip some folder, move that zipped file to google drive, and then delete the source folder. If you just do it once, I bet it’s easier to use the GUI, why would anyone bother with the command line, I hear you ask. Now imagine you need to do the same thing for a different folder once every few days. With the GUI you need to do to the whole thing from scratch every time. With the command line you can reuse the previous command by copypasting it and changing just the name of the folder to apply it to, saving massive amounts of time in the long run. Another reason is the virtually infinite flexibility - everything that can be done with a GUI can be done from the command line, while not everything that can be done from the command line can be done from the GUI. That is because command line is closer to the messy reality of how your operating system actually works underneath, while GUI is basically a nice window dressing hiding the command line reality below. This leads to another important aspect - the command line is almost guaranteed to work, very important especially for rescuing computers. The GUI is basically a cherry on top of an operating system, and it requires the vast majority of the operating system to work correctly, otherwise it also fails to work. Command line, on the other hand, is one of the minimum things that an OS will have working if it manages to start at all. I’ve seen plenty of computers in my life in which GUI failed to start, but the command line worked just fine and could be used to rescue the computer. I have never seen a computer in which the command line failed to work but the GUI was fine and could be used for rescue purposes, I don’t think that’s even possible. Also, GUIs are costly in terms of CPU and RAM use. That doesn’t really matter on your personal computer, since its main purpose is for you to interact with it, so it would be crazy to make savings by reducing interactivity. But on a business server used to serve a website or process some data, the primary purpose is different and direct interaction with human users occurs only when necessary (software updates, backups, and such), for the most part they are to be left alone. For them it makes no sense to pay the cost of a GUI just to use it once in a few days or even weeks. That is why most servers do not have GUIs and command line is the only way to communicate with them."},{"prompt":"w did algorithms predicting Hillary Clinton’s landslide victory in the 2016 Presidential Election get their prediction so wrong?","completion":"Insofar as I can tell, there were several issues. Several, pollsters regular talked about throughout the election cycle. America has changed insofar as the use of pollsters using landlines to conduct their polling and the people in the US who actually have/use landlines. The people that have landlines tend to skew older and are more likely to have voted for Trump, so that makes zero sense so that’s my issue with that excuse, although overall it’s 100% true that the landline is becoming as obsolete as the covered wagon. The other thing that is more likely, and you did hear, is that polls are live surveys. It’s a live person asking you your voting preferences. Even then Trump was so polarizing and the perception was that a vote for Trump was a vote for segregated schools and oppressed women and who knows what. Pogroms (although Ivanka Trump is Jewish)? So the respondent could have felt one thing and answered another. It also depends who they were polling. If the sample was the following: In a survey of 1000 voters they indicated the following affiliation: 460 Democrats, 100 Independents, 420 Republicans, 20 Other That sample is already fairly imbalanced. It looks like they did a good job getting a good representation. But it’s unlikely that the independents are going to be a precise 50/50. They had the same fear of looking biased to the pollster on the phone. In a market research study, we use screeners so as not to taint the results. We ask questions and, if someone suddenly gives an answer that suddenly no longer makes them eligible for the research, we thank them for their time and abort. It avoids a sample that is biased or that won’t answer our ultimate question. What should have happened here is the following: They need 500 Democrats and 500 Republicans. They call until the talk to 500 Democrats. Once they get 500, they keep calling and then every time they get a Democrat, they thank them and discontinue asking questions. They then do the same for Republicans. Boom, fair results that give you real answers. Also, these would be better done online versus via a phone call so that no one feels the need to lie. A lot of quantitative market research is now done online.

GDP growth has fallen sharply in most countries, and there are no signs of improvement. Stock markets have plummeted, crude oil prices have plummeted, inflation is rising and real estate markets across the world are still stuck in doldrums. And even though automobile industry has been seeing some growth recently, it's still not out of the woods yet because consumers are still wary about buying new cars when there is so much uncertainty about jobs and wages in their country or city. Every setback for the economy has been a time to buy as well As an investor, you should always be aware of the risks. In this section, we will take a look at whether or not we are headed into a recession. The last two recessions were caused by financial crises in the US and Europe respectively. Every setback for the economy has been a time to buy as well. For example: ● During 2000-2002; emerging markets such as India were among those hit hardest by contagion from global central banks’ interest rate cuts. However, they also had some of their best years after these recessions ended (see our article “India: A Growth Story). ● Similarly, 2017 was an excellent year for emerging markets due to rising commodity prices (a result of massive Chinese demand) and strong growth in both China and India (see our article “Is this Bull Market Just Getting Started?”). Credit growth has been muted since the days of the IL&FS crisis Credit growth is one of the most important indicators of the health of an economy. If a country is able to maintain healthy credit growth, it’s usually a sign that people are confident about the future and willing to borrow money from banks. However, credit growth in India has been muted since the days of the IL&FS crisis in August 2018. This could be a sign that consumer confidence is low, or it could be an indication that people aren’t using their savings on investments—they are hoarding cash instead. But, historically what happens during a recession on the stock market? The market is a leading indicator of economic activity. It typically falls before the economy tanks and then recovers before the economy starts growing again. In 2007, as the Great Recession began to take shape, the S&P 500 index dropped by more than 50%. The market crashed not long after that, with many stocks losing over 80% of their value in a matter of months. But by March 2009—when the job market hit rock bottom—the S&P 500 was up nearly 30%, having recovered its losses in less than two years' time (and this despite an additional three years of recession!). How does one stay safe during a recession? As we inch closer to a possible recession, it is important that you take steps now so that you can stay safe and secure during such times. ● Don't invest in the stock market. The volatility of the stock market can be dangerous. Avoid making any major investments until the economy has stabilized again. ● Invest in gold or secure funds instead of stocks: If you must invest, opt for gold or a government-backed scheme such as Ulips or PPF (Public Provident Fund). These will ensure that your money is safe even if there's an economic downturn in future as they are not linked to volatile markets like equities are. ● Keep income steady: In times of recession, people often cut down on entertainment expenses like eating out at restaurants or travelling abroad; however this may not be enough to save money quickly enough if inflation rises significantly during such times so it's important not only to curb unnecessary expenditure but also try increasing your income wherever possible by doing freelance work etcetera if needed! You might also want t consider taking up freelance jobs on sites like Fiverr which pay their users pretty well! Withdrawal of funds from your investments and putting them into savings account that pays interest won't help. You could consider small savings schemes instead of parking your money in bank savings accounts or fixed deposits. It's not a good time to withdraw money from your investments and put it into savings accounts that pay interest. You could consider small savings schemes instead of parking your money in bank savings accounts or fixed deposits. As the economy starts to slow down, it is not a good idea to be greedy. It is better to invest in gold than anything else at this point of time because gold has been considered as one of the safest investment options for decades now and its value doesn't depreciate too much even when there is economic slowdown or recession. Investing in gold is one of the best options to hedge against inflation and protect capital. However, it is not a regular income producing instrument. I personally keep around 5-10% of my portfolio in gold as an insurance for emergencies and for wealth protection. During volatile times, investors would do well to keep some portion of their investment portfolio in gold as insurance from market fluctuations, debts and inflationary shocks.

During volatile times, investors would do well to keep some portion of their investment portfolio in gold as insurance from market fluctuations, debts and inflationary shocks. In addition to this personal preference, I have seen many people diversifying their portfolios with gold ETFs because they feel that it will protect them against a recession by providing liquidity during market downturns. The choice of whether or not you want to invest your hard earned money into something like this should ultimately come down to your own risk appetite - but here are three reasons why I think investing in gold could be right for you: Wrapping Up ● Recession is part of the business cycle, which means it's cyclical. It comes and goes like a storm—and when it comes again, you might be better prepared than ever before. ● Decrease spending as much as possible to keep your business going strong in the long-term. ● Don't panic or give up hope! Recessions don't last forever, and there are always ways to adapt and adjust during them. ● With careful planning and preparation beforehand, there's no reason why you can't weather any recession that comes your way with ease!"},{"prompt":"What are some arguments I can make to fight a fire hydrant ticket?

I mean I ask you. If you consider yourself a working class person probably working one if not more jobs on a minimum wage while trying to bring up two children and keep a roof over your collective heads, not to mention a stressed out partner and possibly caring for an elderly relative.

The first is something I regularly order at sit-down breakfast restaurants (Village Inn, IHOP, Dennys, and similar): French toast covered in sausage gravy, specifically requesting that they do NOT dust the French toast in powdered sugar. A side dish of hash browns smothered in grilled peppers and onions, topped with melted cheese, makes a divine breakfast. The second is something I order at my local Whataburger: I order a double meat Whataburger Jr with bacon, extra cheese, and grilled peppers and onions, and a Breakfast on a Bun (egg, cheese, sausage patty) with double extra cheese. I then ask them to specifically put the fixings for the breakfast on a bun inside the Whataburger Jr. End result is burger, cheese, sausage, cheese, burger, cheese, bacon, egg and the grilled peppers and onions on top between the buns…the extra cheese then goes on the other bun as a plain grilled cheese. If for any reason, the counter clerk or management won’t make that sandwich for me, I simply order them individually, then take the top bun off the Whataburger Jr, take the bottom bun off the breakfast sandwich, and I have my grilled cheese, then I take the rest of the Breakfast on a bun, and set it on top of the Whataburger Jr…might not be as neatly built as when the staff makes it as ordered, but at least I get my sandwiches without argument :)"},{"prompt":"f you and your wife were laying in bed and you both hear a noise downstairs at 3 AM, do you believe that it is your duty as a man to investigate the noise and put yourself at potential risk to protect you and your wife?

Even excluding medicine, I have tried living in places without a sewage system, and I prefer flushing toilets to pit latrines. Having tried both, I also like the house to be warmed up in the winter, before I get out of bed rather than shrugging into a pile of clothes and getting the fire going strongly. Ice on the inside of the windows is not my idea of a good time. Electric lights are much easier on the eyes than rushlights, and don't smell as much. I have looked after both, and I can assure you that cars are much less much less trouble to take care of than horses, and will go a lot faster in more comfort. I enjoy reading books that are cheaper and more plentiful than illuminated manuscripts would be, and tv, films, computer games and recorded music are all available at the touch of a button. In fact science has brought a greater degree of comfortable living to regular working people than would have been barely obtainable even by an emperor with hundreds of servants in a pre scientific age.

So, Tissue culture can make true-to-type mother plant multiplication (like photocopying from an original), in a short span of time, in large numbers, uniform and throughout the year. Any of this is impossible in ordinary plant propagation methods (budding, grafting, splitting mother bulb / corm / rhizome).

Some of the key entities and groups that have significant influence on the world stage include: 1. **Governments**: Governments of powerful countries and major geopolitical players have significant influence over international affairs, trade, and diplomacy. 2. **International Organizations**: Entities like the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Trade Organization (WTO), and others play crucial roles in global governance and cooperation. 3. **Corporations**: Large multinational corporations often have substantial economic and political influence, given their vast resources and global reach. 4. **Financial Institutions**: Central banks and financial institutions exert considerable influence over the global economy and monetary policies. 5. **Media**: Media outlets can shape public opinion, influence political discourse, and impact perceptions of world events. 6. **Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)**: NGOs and advocacy groups play a role in influencing policy, raising awareness about social issues, and promoting change. 7. **Powerful Individuals**: Influential individuals, such as world leaders, billionaires, and philanthropists, can have significant impact and resources to shape global issues. It's essential to understand that power and influence in the world are not concentrated in the hands of a single entity or group.

Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) officials reported that the Mangalyaan’s main liquid engine test firing was successful. The engine had been lying inactive for the orbiter’s entire journey so far and it was a concern whether it will function efficiently and timely on demand.This successful four seconds burn on Monday has corrected the trajectory and has also ensured that the rocket is functioning properly and is ready for the 24 minutes long firing on September 24. Here are 8 reasons why India’s Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) is just amazing: The Mangalyaan mission cost India 73 million (~Rs.450 crores) which is even cheaper than an [LINKED_TEXT: eight lane bridge in Mumbai] [URL: http://www.forbes.com/2009/06/25/bombay-bridge-opens-business-emerging-markets-sealink.html] which cost 340 million. It is less than the budget of film “Gravity” which was about 105 million and about one-tenth of what the US has spent on MAVEN, making it undoubtedly the most cost-effective inter-planetary space mission to have ever been undertaken anywhere in the world! In real terms, when distributed over the population of 1.2 billion, every Indian has contributed Rs.4 per towards the mission. Mangalyaan will observe the environment of Mars and look for various elements like methane (marsh gas), which is a possible indicator of life. It will also look for Deuterium-Hydroden ratio and other neutral constants. The orbiter weighs 1,350-kg, which is even less than the weight of an average sports utility vehicle The manufacturing of Mangalyaan took 15 months while NASA took five years to complete [LINKED_TEXT: MAVEN] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAVEN].Mangalyaan is the first spacecraft to be launched outside the Earth’s sphere of influence by ISRO in its entire history of 44 years. ISRO will be the fourth space agency in the world after National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the US, Russian Federal Space Agency (RFSA) and European Space Agency to have successfully undertaken a mission to Mars.

Why or why not?","completion":"When I was young and before I was really married. I mean really married as 1. actually married 2. having spent enough years married that you really know some one with out guess work, I would have said yes. Just like I would say I would rather be shot then give up my wallet. However, I go downstairs , I get shot , I am dead and my wife is still not protected. I die doing something stupid like standing up to a mugger and my wife is left alone both angry and sad. My wife will very clearly tell anyone that she would rather buy a new television than pay for a funeral, she would much rather lose a pretty piece of jewelry than mourn me and thinks it is very selfish , and has told me such, for me to stupidly risk my life knowing that my death would make her very sad for something as unimportant as things. She has told me the message is that you love the TV more than me. Of course going to check out the noise. But I can not ever imagine jumping up and racing straight to a sound . That is entering blindly with no situational awareness. I have heard and investigated noises before. First you hear the noise , second you listen for more noises, then you talk about what you think it might have been and decide where it came from. Then one of you starts to get up , the other asks if you want them to come with you. This is basically how real life works. If I thought it were dangerousI would have her come with me , you never seperate , movies teach you that. In the case where I was fairly sure it was an intruder, we would get the guns and the mobile,. go into the bathroom, get in the tub and call the police. In any scenario the police are going to show up anyway. I would much rather they have to do their paperwork for shooting some one then me after already being woken up at 3 am , having a very traumatic experience of killing some one in my house, then have to go through all the headache of paper work over it. The cops volunteered to work doing that, they are paid to do it, the expect to deal with it, and our local government has decided they should be the ones to deal with it. My wife and I are safe in the tub with protection. If you do not think the bath tub is one of the safest places in the house when getting attacked watch how hard it is for two guys to beat Jack Reacher in a tub with a bat and crowbar. Any Bathroom the bathtub has a distinct positional control and advantage on the door either it has clear view of the door even if the door opens on it , you are at the advantage , and in many cases the tub has to be approached from the door in an open way with much reaction time by the person already in the bathroom . It might seem cowardly, but , it is heroic and here is how it is heroic, I am choosing the protection of my family over grand delusions of seeming heroic. The desire to be the hero is a selfish ego act, the protecting of my wife is the act of selflessness and maturity, because there is going to always be a time after an intruder that has to be dealt with.
