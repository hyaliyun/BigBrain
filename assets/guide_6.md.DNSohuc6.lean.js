Run your washing machine and dishwasher only when they are full. Check for leaks regularly. Take your climate into consideration when landscaping. Don't wash your car that often.","completion":"As the world’s population continues to grow, so does the demand for resources such as water. Conserving water is one of the easiest and most effective ways to make a real difference in the fight against climate change, as well as to save money on your water bill. There are a number of simple and effective ways to conserve water, which can easily be implemented in your everyday routine. One of the easiest ways to conserve water is to take shorter showers. A five-minute shower uses far less water than a long, leisurely soak in the tub. Additionally, running your washing machine and dishwasher only when they are full can help to save significant amounts of water over time. A single large load of laundry can use as much as 40 gallons of water, so washing only full loads is a simple way to reduce water consumption. It's also important to check for leaks regularly. A small leak can waste a significant amount of water over time, so it's important to fix leaks as soon as they are detected. A slow drip from a faucet can waste as much as 20 gallons of water a day, while a leaky toilet can waste up to 200 gallons of water a day. When it comes to landscaping, it's important to take your climate into consideration. This means choosing plants that are native to your region and require less water, as well as using mulch to retain moisture in the soil. By planting native species, you can help to reduce water consumption in your garden and prevent the need for excessive watering. Finally, it's important to avoid washing your car too often. Instead of wasting water by hosing down your car every weekend, try using a bucket and sponge to wash your car by hand. Not only will this save water, but it will also give you a chance to get up close and personal with your car's finish, allowing you to check for any scratches or other issues that need attention. In conclusion, conserving water is one of the most important things we can do to protect our planet and ensure a sustainable future for generations to come. By implementing these simple and effective water-saving methods in your everyday routine, you can make a real difference in the fight against climate change while also saving money on your water bill."},{"prompt":"begin your free file analysis, simply draganddrop your fat file inside the dotted lines below, or click browse my computer and select your file.

U.N. report: Fifteen people died, 69 were hospitalized, and thousands were treated. Toxic waste areas still have not been decontaminated, U.N. statement says. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Dutch multinational Trafigura has denied harming anyone with their toxic dumping in Ivory Coast, claiming that experts have found no evidence of harm. This is in direct contrast to a U.N. report that revealed 15 people died, 69 were hospitalized, and thousands more were treated as a result of the dumping. The toxic waste sites still have not been properly decontaminated according to the U.N. The dumping occurred in 2006 and saw the company depositing thousands of tonnes of waste in and around the city of Abidjan. The toxic chemicals, which are known to damage the respiratory and nervous systems, quickly caused widespread panic and outrage among locals. Despite the company's assertions that there were no harmful effects from the dumping, the U.N. report's findings highlight the grave repercussions on the Ivorian population. Those exposed to the toxic chemicals experienced vomiting, nausea, respiratory problems and had damaged immune systems - the elderly were particularly vulnerable. Moreover, the U.N. statement that the toxic waste sites are still contaminated years later is a damning indictment of Trafigura’s approach to environmental responsibility. The waste should have been cleaned up immediately, and the fact that it still has not been dealt with properly is unacceptable. This is not the first time that Trafigura has faced criticism for their environmental record. The company was previously involved in a large-scale oil spill in Nigeria that caused severe ecological damage. It is crucial that multinational firms, such as Trafigura, are held accountable for their actions and have a duty to clean up and attend to the negative effects of their waste. It is inexcusable that the company is still denying the harmful impact of their dumping in Ivory Coast, and it is imperative that measures are taken to prevent such occurrences in the future."},{"prompt":"Please answer a question about the following article about Samurai: For example, the full name of Oda Nobunaga would be Oda Kazusanosuke Saburo Nobunaga (織田上総介三郎信長), in which Oda is a clan or family name, Kazusanosuke is a title of vicegovernor of Kazusa province, Saburo is a formal nickname (yobina), and Nobunaga is an adult name (nanori) given at genpuku, the coming of age ceremony.

Iron the top of the shirt With the shirt still inside out, iron the top of the shirt, working from the shoulder seams toward the center of the shirt. Be mindful of buttons and buttonholes. 5. Iron the middle and bottom of the shirt After ironing the top portions, move down to the middle and bottom of the shirt. Be sure to straighten the shirt as needed to avoid wrinkling. Be aware of the seam work, as this is a crucial time frame to make sure everything is aligned appropriately. 6. Turn the shirt right-side out Finally, turn the shirt right-side out, button it up, and iron the front of the shirt. Start at the top and work your way down one side and then to the other.

First, create a background by painting with your desired color. Let the paint dry completely before moving on to the next step. Next, sketch out the clouds you want to paint directly onto the background. This will give you an idea of where to place the colors as you start to layer. Once you have the basic sketch of the clouds, it's time to start layering over them with lighter shades of paint. This will give the clouds depth and make them look more realistic. Be sure to blend the paint where it meets the background to make it look seamless. To add interest to your painting, you can also add in patches of the background color in the spaces between the clouds. This will break up any monotony and give your painting a more dynamic look. Finally, to make the clouds pop even more, you can add highlights in a cream color. This will make the edges of the clouds stand out and give them a fluffy appearance. Remember to blend the highlights in with the rest of the paint for a cohesive look.

You don’t need any special equipment to stargaze -- just a clear view of the sky and a willingness to look up and appreciate the beauty of the universe. While you’re enjoying the stars, be mindful of any wildlife you might encounter. If you’re stargazing in a national park or other wilderness area, you may come across nocturnal animals like raccoons, skunks, or even bears.

Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface.

This is a chemical process that begins as you start to chew your food. The saliva in your mouth starts this process. Once you swallow, the acid in your stomach further breaks down food. From the stomach, the foods moves into the small intestine. In the small intestines, another set of chemicals goes to work. Are you surprised?

This is particularly common in areas such as the US Gulf coast, where refineries were designed to process Venezuelan and Mexican oil, and in areas such as the US Midwest where refineries were rebuilt to process heavy oil as domestic light oil production declined. Given the choice, such heavy oil refineries usually prefer to buy bitumen rather than synthetic oil because the cost is lower, and in some cases because they prefer to produce more diesel fuel and less gasoline. By 2015 Canadian production and exports of nonupgraded bitumen exceeded that of synthetic crude oil at over 1.3 million barrels (210×10^3 m3) per day, of which about 65% was exported to the United States.

The government of Brazil provides universal TBcare, which reduces this problem.

In a statement, he said that such an inquiry \\"will involve yet more enormous cost, both to the public purse and the participants\\". Lord Leveson's inquiry, which began in 2011 and reported in 2012, resulted in a raft of proposed changes to press regulation, including the establishment of a new regulatory body, the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO). However, critics of the press argue that IPSO has not done enough to hold newspapers to account, particularly in cases of intrusion and harassment. As a result, some have called for a new inquiry to be launched, to explore how best to enforce press standards and protect the public from abuses by media organisations. But Lord Leveson has urged caution, warning that any further inquiry would be costly and time-consuming. He also expressed doubt about whether a new inquiry would be able to achieve anything that his original inquiry had not. Instead, he suggested that efforts should be focused on improving the existing regulatory framework and strengthening IPSO's powers, so that it is better able to hold newspapers to account. Lord Leveson's comments are likely to be welcomed by some in the media, who have long argued that the existing regulatory framework is sufficient, and that a further inquiry would be a waste of public money. However, they are also likely to be criticised by those who feel that the press is still not doing enough to protect individuals' privacy and dignity. In conclusion, it is clear that there are strong views on both sides of the debate around press regulation, and the role that an inquiry might play in this. While some believe that a further investigation is needed to protect the public and reinforce press standards, others argue that this would be an unnecessary expense that would achieve little. Whatever the outcome, it is clear that there is scope for improvement in the way that the media operates, and how it is held accountable for its actions."},{"prompt":"(CNN What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"I'm sorry, but you haven't provided the article or its title for me to identify the highlight points.

During this same time period, the country also managed to create 9.3 million new jobs. However, the native-born American population of working age grew by a staggering 25.2 million, leading to a low labor-participation rate and a shortage of available jobs.

This trend has also served to fuel anti-immigration sentiment, as many Americans blame immigrants for job losses and wage stagnation. However, it is worth remembering that many immigrants play a vital role in the US economy, and contribute significantly to the country's growth and prosperity.

The multi-faith service, attended by Henning's family, was held to honor his life and contributions to the people of Syria. The event was attended by people from different faiths, including representatives from the Muslim community, which Henning was also a part of. The service was a reminder of the unity and compassion that Henning embodied throughout his life. Alan Henning's death was a loss felt globally, but his legacy will continue to inspire others to carry out similar acts of kindness and support for those in need.

The age of printing made the scribal profession effectively redundant. Printed editions, while less susceptible to the proliferation of variations likely to arise during manual transmission, are nonetheless not immune to introducing variations from an author's autograph. Instead of a scribe miscopying his source, a compositor or a printing shop may read or typeset a work in a way that differs from the autograph. Since each scribe or printer commits different errors, reconstruction of the lost original is often aided by a selection of readings taken from many sources. An edited text that draws from multiple sources is said to be eclectic. In contrast to this approach, some textual critics prefer to identify the single best surviving text, and not to combine readings from multiple sources. Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable. How do differences in works arise when using a printing press?","completion":"Differences in works can arise when using a printing press if a compositor or a printing shop may read or typeset a work in a way that differs from the autograph."},{"prompt":"Article: Capacitors, especially ceramic capacitors, and older designs such as paper capacitors, can absorb sound waves resulting in a microphonic effect. Vibration moves the plates, causing the capacitance to vary, in turn inducing AC current. Some dielectrics also generate piezoelectricity. The resulting interference is especially problematic in audio applications, potentially causing feedback or unintended recording. In the reverse microphonic effect, the varying electric field between the capacitor plates exerts a physical force, moving them as a speaker. This can generate audible sound, but drains energy and stresses the dielectric and the electrolyte, if any.

The investigation into Park View School was part of a broader probe into 21 schools in the region suspected of having links to Islamic fundamentalists. The findings have raised concerns about the influence of hardline Islamic ideology in schools and the potential impact on young people. Critics have called for greater scrutiny of schools and of external speakers invited onto school grounds. The revelations at Park View School are sure to be concerning for parents and pupils across the region. They will want to be reassured that schools are safe places for children to learn and grow, free from any kind of extremist influence.

Its maker, First Warning Systems, says it can alert doctors to cancer cells. Doctors say the system isn't ready to be fully trusted yet.","completion":"First Warning Systems has introduced a new bra that has sensors that can detect temperature changes in breast tissue. According to the makers of the bra, this technology can alert doctors to cancer cells in the breast. While this technology is still being tested, doctors have not fully trusted it yet. The technology behind the bra is based on the idea that cancerous cells produce more heat than normal cells. The sensors in the bra detect these heat changes and can alert doctors to potential cancerous cells in the breast. The idea is that this technology could be helpful in detecting breast cancer early, which is the key to successful treatment. However, many doctors are cautious about the use of this technology. While the concept is promising, there are concerns about the accuracy of the sensors and the effectiveness of the bra in detecting cancer. Additionally, there is a worry that this technology could lead to false positives or unnecessary biopsies, which can cause anxiety and harm to patients. In conclusion, while the idea of a bra that can detect breast cancer is certainly innovative, it is important to approach this technology with caution. Until there is more research and testing conducted, it is uncertain whether or not this technology will be a reliable way to detect breast cancer. As with any medical technology, it is crucial that doctors continue to monitor and test this technology to ensure that it is safe and effective for patients."},{"prompt":"What are the most important words in the following sentence: portrait of a mother and daughter","completion":"Portrait, mother, daughter."},{"prompt":"Ask a question about Asphalt.","completion":"What is the primary use of asphalt in construction?"},{"prompt":"Sentence 1: With an army mostly composed of Danish troops and reinforced by German mercenaries , he initially camped at Norrmalm , but later on to Södermalm .

The industrial sector includes jobs related to manufacturing, construction, and mining, while the services sector covers a broad range of jobs, including healthcare, education, finance, and hospitality. This percentage difference in employment numbers between the two sectors can be attributed to multiple factors. One of the primary reasons is the growth of the manufacturing industry in many developed countries. Additionally, developing economies have begun to focus on building their industrial sectors to increase economic growth and employment opportunities. On the other hand, the services sector has seen strong growth in recent years due to the increasing demand for healthcare and education services. Moreover, the hospitality industry has also witnessed a significant rise due to the growth of tourism. It is crucial to note that while the industrial sector may have a higher number of workers, the value of services sector jobs is often higher. These jobs are typically considered to be higher-paying and require specialized skills and education. Furthermore, the services sector is often more resilient to economic downturns, as people still require healthcare, education, and financial services regardless of economic circumstances.

Aerobic activity, also referred to as cardio, is any exercise that increases your heart rate and breathing rate, such as jogging, cycling, or swimming. It is essential for maintaining cardiovascular health, building endurance, and burning calories. The American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week for adults. To achieve this, consider adding 30 minutes of cardio to your routine at least 5 days per week. Light strength training is crucial for building and maintaining muscle mass, improving bone density, and increasing metabolism. This type of training typically involves using light weights, resistance bands, or bodyweight exercises to target specific muscle groups. It is recommended to focus on each muscle group twice a week, using a variety of exercises to avoid overuse injuries and to challenge your muscles. Incorporating strength training into your routine for 20-30 minutes, twice a week, is a great starting point for beginners. Managing stress and other emotions is just as important for our overall health as physical exercise. Incorporating practices like meditation, deep breathing, or yoga can help reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. These practices can also improve focus and concentration, boost mood, and increase self-awareness. Taking just 10 to 15 minutes each day to focus on mindfulness can help you manage stress and promote overall well-being. Ultimately, a well-rounded workout routine should include a balance of aerobic activity, light strength training, and stress management practices. Incorporating these three components into a regular routine can help improve overall physical health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases, as well as promote mental and emotional well-being."},{"prompt":"Are these paraphrases?

Initially it was a localized feud between supporters of Gebhard and those of the Catholic core of the Cathedral Chapter. With the election of Ernst of Bavaria as a competing archbishop, what had been a local conflict expanded in scale: Ernst's election guaranteed the military, diplomatic, and financial interest of the Wittelsbach family in the Electorate of Cologne's local affairs. After the deaths of Louis VI, Elector Palatine in 1583 and William the Silent in 1584, the conflict shifted gears again, as the two evenly matched combatants sought outside assistance to break the stalemate. Finally, the intervention of Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma, who had at his command the Spanish Army of Flanders, threw the balance of power in favor of the Catholic side. By 1588, Spanish forces had pushed Gebhard from the Electorate. In 1588 he took refuge in Strassburg, and the remaining Protestant strongholds of the Electorate fell to Parma's forces in 1589.","completion":"What were the three phases of the war in the Electorate of Cologne and how did outside assistance affect the outcome?"},{"prompt":"Sentence 1: Their parents are happy admiring the geometric lawns, neat flower?­beds, and classical statuary, to which has recently been added a collection of modern and contemporary works by such artists as Rodin, Giacometti, Dubuffet, Henry Moore, and Roy Lichtenstein.

One in 10 GPs say one of their patients died because of poor care in hospital. One in five would not want to be cared for at their local hospial.","completion":"It's a worrying trend when doctors themselves are expressing concern over the quality of care at hospitals. Recently, a GP from Kent publicly stated, \\"I wouldn't send my dog to Princess Royal University Hospital in Farnborough.\\" This statement is a strong indictment of the standard of care provided by the hospital. But this GP is not alone in his concerns. Surveys show that one in 10 GPs say that one of their patients has died due to poor care in the hospital. Additionally, one in five doctors would not choose their local hospital for their own care. These numbers are concerning and suggest that there are serious issues with healthcare in our hospitals. Patient care should be the top priority of hospitals, and doctors should be able to trust that their patients are receiving the best possible care. But when even doctors express doubts about the quality of care, it's clear that something needs to change. Hospitals need to prioritize quality care, and actively work to improve patient outcomes. This means investing in staff training and development, and ensuring that all staff have the tools and resources they need to provide the best possible care. It also means being open and transparent about outcomes, so that doctors and patients can make informed decisions about where to seek care. Ultimately, patient care is a shared responsibility. Hospitals need to do everything they can to provide the best possible care, and doctors need to advocate for their patients and hold hospitals accountable when care falls short. Only when everyone is working together can we ensure that patients receive the care they deserve."},{"prompt":"Do these sentences have the same meaning?

The 73-year-old Zeman won with a 51.8% majority in the second round of voting. This victory places Zeman in a powerful position, and his views and opinions are expected to shape the country's policies in the coming years. According to analysts, Zeman is more likely to form a government dependent on the support of the Communist Party, which has not held significant power in the Czech Republic since the Velvet Revolution. Zeman stated that he is open to working with any political party that is willing to support his vision for the country. However, this stance has received criticism from some politicians and analysts who are concerned about the possibility of a resurgence of communist influence in the Czech Republic. Though Zeman assured the public that his administration would be free and democratic, some members of the opposition are worried about the potential impact of such a move. Despite this criticism, Zeman's election seems to mark an era of political change in the Czech Republic. Klaus, who has been president since 2003, was known for his conservative views and Eurosceptic stance. Zeman, on the other hand, has been more outspoken about his support for the European Union and may push for greater cooperation with other member countries. In conclusion, the election of Milos Zeman as the new president of the Czech Republic has brought about new challenges and opportunities for the country. While some are concerned about his willingness to work with the Communist Party, others see his presidency as an opportunity to make progress on a range of issues. Regardless of the view one takes, it is clear that the Czech Republic is entering a new phase under Zeman's leadership."},{"prompt":"God never suspends the penalty.

Calm an angry rabbit. Offer your rabbit treats. Expose your rabbit to triggers slowly. Avoid disciplining your rabbit. Find other ways to stop biting. Consider desexing your rabbit.","completion":"Rabbits are adorable furry creatures that make great pets. However, like any animal, they can get angry and aggressive in certain situations. If you want to calm an angry rabbit and prevent biting, there are a few things you can do. Firstly, it's important to determine what's causing your rabbit's anger. Perhaps they're feeling threatened or scared by something in their environment. Whatever the cause, it's important to identify it so you can take steps to prevent it from happening in the future. Once you understand the source of your rabbit's anger, you can work on calming them down. Offering your rabbit treats can be a great way to distract them from their anger. Rabbits love snacks like fresh vegetables, fruits, and hay. By offering your rabbit a treat, you can redirect their attention and encourage them to calm down. When introducing your rabbit to new things that may trigger their anger, it's important to do so slowly and gradually. This will help your rabbit adjust to different situations without getting overwhelmed. For example, if you want to introduce your rabbit to a new toy, start by leaving it near their cage and allowing them to observe it from a distance. Disciplining your rabbit is not the way to go when dealing with an angry bunny. Negative reinforcement can lead to fear and aggression, which can make the problem worse. Instead, try finding other ways to stop biting. For example, you can distract your rabbit with toys, give them a safe space to retreat to or redirect their attention by calmly moving them to a different location. Desexing your rabbit is also an option to prevent aggression. Hormones can often play a role in a rabbit's aggressive behavior. By spaying or neutering your rabbit, you can eliminate these hormonal changes which can help prevent aggressive behaviors. In conclusion, it's important to identify the cause of your rabbit's anger so you can deal with it appropriately. By offering treats, exposing your rabbit to triggers gradually and finding other ways to stop biting such as providing safe spaces, you can help calm your angry bunny. Negative reinforcement should be avoided at all times. Spaying or neutering your rabbit could also be considered as a long term strategy. With patience, love, and understanding, your rabbit can eventually learn to cope with its anger in a healthy way."},{"prompt":"Problem: Solve 1662 = 5*f + 1647 for f.

This record was set by multiple quarterbacks, including Eli Manning, Tony Romo, and Bernie Kosar. The most recent pass of this length occurred in 2011 when Manning connected with Victor Cruz for an incredible touchdown against the New York Jets. Before that, the previous 99-yard touchdown pass was thrown by Tom Brady to Wes Welker in 2011. While a 99-yard touchdown pass is certainly a rare and impressive feat, it is worth noting that there have been several other touchdown passes of significant yardage throughout NFL history. In fact, there have been over 200 touchdown passes of 80 yards or more, with distances ranging from 80 to 99 yards. These long passes require skill and precision on the part of the quarterback, as well as speed and agility from the receiver. In addition to the 99-yard record, there have been several other notable touchdown passes throughout NFL history. One example is the famous \\"Immaculate Reception\\" by Terry Bradshaw in 1972, which went for a distance of 60 yards and helped lead the Pittsburgh Steelers to a playoff victory. Another memorable touchdown pass is the \\"Music City Miracle\\" by the Tennessee Titans in 2000, which went for 75 yards and helped secure a win in a playoff game against the Buffalo Bills. Overall, while the 99-yard touchdown pass is the longest in NFL history, there have been many other impressive and memorable long passes throughout the league's history. These long passes are a testament to the skill and athleticism of the players involved, and they continue to captivate fans and inspire future generations of football players."},{"prompt":"Question: What event were Chopin and Sand at on 26 July 1840?

The car allowed them to come and go as they pleased, and many people would spend only a few days, rather than weeks. Also, the advent of suburbia played a huge role. With many families moving to their own private houses, luxuries such as home air conditioning and swimming pools diminished their interest in flocking to the luxury beach resorts during the hot summer.
