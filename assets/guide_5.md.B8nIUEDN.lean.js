It has excellent thermal shock characteristics, being able to survive immersion in water while red hot. However, its high meltingtemperature (1723 °C) and viscosity make it difficult to work with. Normally, other substances are added to simplify processing. One is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3, soda), which lowers the glass transition temperature. The soda makes the glass watersoluble, which is usually undesirable, so lime (calcium oxide [CaO], generally obtained from limestone), some magnesium oxide (MgO) and aluminium oxide (Al2O3) are added to provide for a better chemical durability. The resulting glass contains about 70 to 74% silica by weight and is called a sodalime glass. Sodalime glasses account for about 90% of manufactured glass.

Freight elevators are generally required to display a written notice in the car that the use by passengers is prohibited (though not necessarily illegal), though certain freight elevators allow dual use through the use of an inconspicuous riser. In order for an elevator to be legal to carry passengers in some jurisdictions it must have a solid inner door. Freight elevators are typically larger and capable of carrying heavier loads than a passenger elevator, generally from 2,300 to 4,500 kg. Freight elevators may have manually operated doors, and often have rugged interior finishes to prevent damage while loading and unloading. Although hydraulic freight elevators exist, electric elevators are more energy efficient for the work of freight lifting.[citation needed] How do freight elevators differ from passenger elevators?

This has caused an uproar amongst the student body and the wider community, with many condemning the sale as discriminatory and racist. Some have argued that the sale is a statement about pending California legislation that would allow for the consideration of race and ethnicity in college admissions. Lewis, one of the members of the Campus Republicans, has stated that the sale is meant to point out the inherent unfairness of such policies. However, this argument has been met with skepticism, with many pointing out that it is still not appropriate to charge people different prices based on their race. Others have been more critical of the sale, with Wise specifically describing it as a \\"sarcastic and rather smarmy slap at people of color.\\" This sentiment has been echoed by many others who see the sale as a deliberate attempt to demean and marginalize people of color. Regardless of the intentions behind the sale, it is clear that it has sparked a heated conversation about race and discrimination on the UC Berkeley campus. Many students and faculty members have called for increased education and awareness around issues of race, and have expressed a desire for the campus to be a more inclusive and welcoming environment for all students. In the end, it remains to be seen what the fallout from this controversial sale will be. But one thing is certain - it has brought issues of race and discrimination to the forefront of the campus conversation, and has caused many to take a closer look at their own attitudes and biases."},{"prompt":"– Rory McIlroy held off Sergio Garcia to win the British Open today, making him only the third golfer in history—after Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods—to have won three different majors by the age of 25, reports the AP.

Participants were asked about how many friends they had met, spoken to, or emailed in the past month. The results of the study showed that areas of the brain were bigger in individuals with more social activity. While social behavior is subjective, the study was aimed at understanding the biological differences between sociable individuals and their more reserved counterparts. The findings suggest that some parts of the brain may play a role in an individual's ability to make social connections. As social creatures, humans thrive on relationships and connections with others. However, not everyone finds it easy to make friends or maintain relationships. The study suggests that the neurological differences in individuals may play a role in their social behavior. The study is limited in scope, as the sample size is small and doesn't represent a larger population. However, the findings provide insight into the biological factors that impact an individual's sociability. In conclusion, the study conducted by Oxford University sheds light on the relationship between brain regions and sociability. While the study is limited in scope, the findings suggest a link between an individual's brain structure and their ability to make and maintain social connections.

Iron the seam to flatten it. Sew along the other edge of the bias binding.","completion":"Sewing Bias Binding on Fabric: A Step-by-Step Guide If you want to add a decorative edge or finish to your fabric project, using bias binding can be a great option. Bias binding is a narrow strip of fabric that is cut on the bias - at a 45-degree angle to the fabric's grain - which allows it to stretch and curve easily along rounded or angled edges. Here's how you can sew bias binding onto your fabric: 1. Mark where you want to sew the bias binding: Use a fabric marker or chalk to make a light mark along the edge of your fabric where you want to attach the bias binding. 2. Pin the bias binding to the fabric: Start by laying the bias binding strip along the marked edge of your fabric, right sides facing each other. With the raw edge of the bias binding aligned with the edge of the fabric, start pinning at one end and continue until you reach the other end. 3. Sew along the crease of the bias binding: Using a sewing machine, stitch along the crease of the bias binding, removing the pins as you go. Take care to sew as straight as possible, ensuring that the stitches catch both the bias binding and the fabric. 4. Press the binding over the seam allowance: With the bias binding sewn onto the fabric, fold it up and over the seam allowance. Use your fingers or a pressing tool to press the folded bias binding down onto the fabric, smoothing out any wrinkles or bumps. 5. Fold the bias binding over to the other side of the fabric: Carefully fold the bias binding over to the other side of the fabric, making sure the folded edge just covers the stitching line. Pin the bias binding in place along this side. 6. Iron the seam to flatten it: Once you have the bias binding correctly aligned and pinned in place, use an iron to press the seam down flat. This ensures that the fabric and binding are secured together and that the edge looks neat and tidy. 7. Sew along the other edge of the bias binding: Finally, sew along the other edge of the bias binding, removing pins as you go. Again, take care to sew as straight as possible, ensuring that the stitches catch both the bias binding and the fabric. And there you have it - by following these simple steps, you can sew bias binding onto your fabric project like a pro! With a little practice, you'll be able to create beautiful and professional-looking edges on all your sewing projects."},{"prompt":"Seeing it made me think about how the men died , and how sad it was that no help came .

The candy is loved by many for its unique flavor, which has remained consistent over the years. However, Cadbury recently made a recipe change that has upset many of its loyal fans. The recipe change occurred after American food giant Kraft acquired the British-based company in 2010. Since then, there have been several changes made to the recipe, and the eggs are not the same as they used to be. Fans have been voicing their frustration over social media, and some have even started petitions to revert to the original recipe. Despite the uproar, Cadbury has stated that the recipe change is only a slight modification and that the eggs still taste as delicious as ever.

One major breakthrough involves the use of anti-PDL1, an immunotherapy drug that has demonstrated remarkable results in the treatment of cancer. Administered via intravenous drip, anti-PDL1 has been shown to clear all tumours from two patients, a remarkable achievement given that these were advanced-stage cancers that had spread throughout the body. The patients, who had been given just a few months to live, were able to make a full recovery thanks to this groundbreaking new treatment. Anti-PDL1 works by targeting a protein known as PD-L1, which is found on the surface of many cancer cells. This protein acts as a \\"cloak\\" that helps cancer cells evade detection by the immune system. By blocking PD-L1, anti-PDL1 allows the immune system to effectively recognize and attack cancer cells. The two patients who were successfully treated with anti-PDL1 had been diagnosed with cancers that were resistant to traditional chemotherapy and radiation. They had exhausted all other treatment options and were facing a bleak prognosis. However, after receiving anti-PDL1, their tumours disappeared completely, and they experienced no adverse side effects. While the use of anti-PDL1 is still in its early stages, these impressive results suggest that it could be a game-changing treatment for cancer patients. With further research and clinical trials, anti-PDL1 could become a standard part of cancer care, offering hope to the millions of people around the world who are affected by this disease. In conclusion, the development of anti-PDL1 represents a major step forward in the fight against cancer. This new treatment has already shown remarkable results, clearing all tumours from two patients who had been considered untreatable. As we continue to explore the potential of immunotherapy, it is exciting to think about the possibilities that this new approach could offer for cancer patients in the years to come."},{"prompt":"ere are some concepts: bank, build, building What is a sentence about these concepts?","completion":"I am going to the bank to withdraw money so I can start building my dream building."},{"prompt":"When the series returned for its abbreviated third season late in 1989, Linda Hamilton had announced her decision to leave the series as she was pregnant at the time.

One important consideration is keeping them hydrated. A great way to preserve soil moisture is to use black mulch. This will not only lock in moisture but it will also help to prevent weeds from taking hold. However, the mulch alone won't be enough to prevent your tomatoes from getting too parched. It is important to soak your tomato plants every 7-10 days, especially during dry spells. Consistent watering helps to reduce the risk of rot and ensures that your plants receive the nutrients they need to grow strong and healthy. Another issue that tomato growers may face is spider mites. These tiny pests can wreak havoc on your plants by sucking their juices and causing leaves to dry up and wilt. If you notice any signs of spider mites, use a hose to spray them away. Regularly inspecting your plants can help catch infestation early and prevent it from spreading. To increase soil moisture, consider keeping a layer of water in your pot saucers. This can be especially helpful during hot summer months when water evaporates quickly. Additionally, installing a humidifier close to your tomato plants can help to boost their moisture levels. This can be particularly beneficial for indoor gardeners or those growing tomatoes in dry or arid climates.

The vomit itself may provide insight into what is causing the possibility of an upset stomach. For instance, if the vomit contains food, it may indicate that your dog might have eaten something that disagrees with them. On the other hand, if the vomit is primarily liquid, it could point to additional health problems such as dehydration or a gastrointestinal blockage. It is essential to watch out for other symptoms of potential distress during vomiting episodes. For one, excessive drooling that often accompanies vomiting could be a sign that your dog is experiencing discomfort or pain. Another behavior to look out for is the manifestation of abdominal pains that may lead to repeated vomiting spells.

This esteem and prestige was based on both precedent and custom, as well as the caliber and reputation of the senators. The senate passed decrees, which were called senatus consulta.

The team struggled in the early years, failing to make the playoffs in their first six seasons. It was not until the 1983-84 season, 17 years since their founding, that the Penguins emerged as a competitive team in the league. However, it took the Penguins another 20 years to win their first-ever Presidents Trophy. The Presidents Trophy is awarded to the team that finishes the regular season with the most points. It is considered a significant achievement in the NHL. The 2000-2001 season proved to be a historic one for the Penguins. Led by future Hall of Famers Mario Lemieux and Jaromir Jagr, the team had an exceptional season, finishing with a record of 48-27-7-0 and 106 points, the most of any team in the league. This earned them their first-ever Presidents Trophy in franchise history. Although the Penguins were unable to win the Stanley Cup that year, the Presidents Trophy marked a significant milestone for the team. It was a sign that the Penguins had finally established themselves as one of the elite teams in the NHL after years of mediocrity and struggle. In summary, it took the Pittsburgh Penguins a total of 37 years since their founding to win their first-ever Presidents Trophy in the 2000-2001 season. The achievement was a testament to the team's perseverance and determination to overcome years of struggle and emerge as one of the NHL's top teams."},{"prompt":"w has Bollywood corrupted the Indian youth's perception of love?

Chlorophyll absorbs the long wavelengths of light (red) and short wavelengths of light (blue) much more efficiently than the wavelengths that appear green to the human eye, so light reflected by plants is enriched in green. Chlorophyll absorbs green light poorly because it first arose in organisms living in oceans where purple halobacteria were already exploiting photosynthesis.

For parents who are looking for an even more convenient option, disposable sippy cups can be a great choice.

If you're looking for alternatives to sippy cups, there are a few options to consider. For younger children, bottles with handles and spouts can be a great choice, while older children may be able to drink from a regular cup with some assistance. Ultimately, the right choice will depend on your child's age and developmental stage, as well as your own preferences as a parent.

Consider incorporating a message for fiction works. Be creative.","completion":"When it comes to writing a story, one of the most important decisions you'll make is determining the main components of your plot. These components typically include the characters, setting, conflict, and resolution. Without these key elements, it can be challenging to create a cohesive story that engages readers from start to finish. Once you have a clear idea of your plot, you may want to consider incorporating a message into your work. While not all stories need to have a moral or message, incorporating one can add depth and meaning to your work. If you're writing a work of fiction, consider what you want your readers to take away from the story. Is there a particular message or theme that you want to convey? Incorporating a message into your story doesn't mean you have to sacrifice creativity. In fact, it can give you more freedom to be imaginative and innovative in your storytelling. Think about how you can incorporate your message in subtle yet impactful ways. Maybe it's through a character's personal transformation or a plot twist that challenges the reader's assumptions. Ultimately, the key is to strike a balance between the components of your plot and the message you want to convey. Your story should be engaging, entertaining, and thought-provoking all at once. By taking the time to carefully plan out your plot and message, you can craft a truly unforgettable story that will leave a lasting impression on your readers."},{"prompt":"Write the answer: The English town of Colchester lies on which river?","completion":"River Colne."},{"prompt":"She felt like an old friend , like family , and I 'd like to claim the Darbys as honorary Acevedos .

Plants evolved chemical defenses against this herbivory and the insects, in turn, evolved mechanisms to deal with plant toxins.

This touchdown was scored when Tatum recovered a fumble by Packers quarterback Scott Hunter, who had attempted to sneak into the end zone from the one-yard line. However, Tatum stripped Hunter of the ball and fell into the end zone himself, scoring the only touchdown of the game. It is worth noting that while Tatum's one-inch touchdown is the shortest in recorded history, there have been countless other short touchdowns that have occurred in football games. In fact, touchdowns of two yards or less are not uncommon, particularly in goal-line situations where offenses often rely on short runs or quick passes to score. Overall, the length of a touchdown play can vary widely depending on the circumstances of the game and the strategies employed by the teams involved. While Jack Tatum's one-inch run will always be remembered as the shortest touchdown in history, it is just one example of the many exciting and unpredictable moments that make football such a thrilling and beloved sport."},{"prompt":"Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?

To find the shortest field goal in a game, one should look for the field goals made and missed by each team in the box score. The length of the field goal is typically included in the box score, along with other relevant details such as the quarter and time of the kick, the name of the kicker, and any other relevant notes about the kick. For example, in a recent NFL game between the Dallas Cowboys and the New York Giants, played on January 3, 2021, the shortest field goal made was a 38-yard kick by the Cowboys' kicker, Greg Zuerlein, in the second quarter. Zuerlein made two other field goals in the game, from 57 and 48 yards, respectively, and did not miss any kicks. In contrast, the Giants' kicker, Graham Gano, made both of his field goal attempts, from 50 and 55 yards, respectively. Therefore, the shortest field goal attempt in the game was not missed.

Mix the ingredients together using a fork, then make any necessary adjustments. Transfer the scrub to an airtight jar and store it in a cool, dry place. Use the scrub once to twice a week on your arms and legs.","completion":"Coffee and Sugar Scrub: A Simple DIY Recipe for Radiant Skin If you're on the lookout for an easy, affordable and eco-friendly alternative to store-bought body scrubs, you're in luck. With just a few kitchen ingredients, you can whip up a nourishing yet invigorating coffee and sugar scrub that will leave your skin feeling smooth and rejuvenated. To make this scrub, all you need is some finely-ground coffee, white sugar, coconut oil or olive oil, and some vanilla extract and/or cinnamon for a delightful scent. You can easily find these ingredients in your pantry or at your local grocery store. Start by mixing ½ cup of coffee and ½ cup of sugar in a medium-sized bowl. You can adjust the proportions according to your preferences, but make sure you use fairly equal amounts of coffee and sugar to balance the exfoliating and moisturizing properties of each ingredient. Next, add ¼ cup of coconut oil or olive oil to the mix. Both oils are rich in antioxidants and healthy fats that help nourish and protect the skin. Coconut oil is especially beneficial for dry or sensitive skin, while olive oil is great for mature or oily skin. If you want to add some fragrance to your scrub, you can sprinkle in a few drops of vanilla extract or ½ teaspoon of ground cinnamon. Both ingredients have a pleasant aroma and offer additional skin benefits. Vanilla extract is anti-inflammatory and mildly exfoliating, while cinnamon is antiseptic and helps improve circulation. Mix all the ingredients together with a fork until you get a smooth, slightly gritty paste. If the scrub feels too wet or dry, you can adjust the oil or sugar accordingly. You want the scrub to feel moist enough to spread easily on your skin, but not too oily or sticky. Once you're happy with the consistency, transfer the scrub to an airtight jar or container. Mason jars work great for this purpose, or you can reuse an old jar or bottle you already have at home. Be sure to store the scrub in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight, as this will help preserve its freshness and potency. To use the scrub, simply scoop out a small amount (about a tablespoon) and massage it onto your damp skin in circular motions. Focus on areas that tend to be rough or dry, such as your elbows, knees, and feet. The coffee and sugar particles will gently slough away dead skin cells and promote cell turnover, while the oil will hydrate and protect your skin. Rinse the scrub off with warm water and pat your skin dry with a towel. Repeat this process once to twice a week, depending on your skin type and needs. You should notice a visible improvement in the texture and appearance of your skin after just a few uses. Regular use of this homemade scrub can help reduce dryness, dullness, and blemishes, and give you a radiant and healthy-looking glow."},{"prompt":"Aspirated consonant: Standard Chinese (Mandarin) has stops and affricates distinguished by aspiration: for instance, /t tʰ/, /t͡s t͡sʰ/.

Serve immediately.","completion":"There's nothing quite like a hot cup of tea or coffee to start the day or unwind in the evening. However, many people overlook the importance of boiling the water for their beverages. Boiling the water is crucial in both preventing the spread of harmful bacteria and enhancing the flavors of tea or coffee. When water reaches boiling point (100 degrees Celsius), it kills any harmful bacteria or viruses that might be present in the water. Therefore, it is essential to use boiling water for all hot beverages, including tea, coffee, and hot chocolate. Additionally, hot water helps dissolve the flavors and aromas of tea leaves and coffee beans better, resulting in a more satisfying and flavorful drink. Once the water has been boiled, it should be served immediately. Leaving water to cool for too long can diminish the quality of the drink, make it less flavorful, and in some cases, even spoil it. Therefore, it's important to take the time to boil fresh water, rather than re-boil old or previously heated water. In conclusion, boiling water is an essential step when making hot beverages. Not only does it eliminate bacteria and enhance the flavors of tea or coffee, but serving it immediately ensures that the drink remains at its best quality.
