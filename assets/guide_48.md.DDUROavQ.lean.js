Think about what is truly important to you in a partner, whether it’s a shared love of travel, political beliefs, or something else entirely. By being clear about your deal breakers, you’ll be better equipped to weed out potential matches that aren’t right for you. Another helpful approach is to treat dating as you would a friendship. Look for someone with whom you share a genuine connection and can enjoy spending time with, rather than someone who simply checks off certain boxes. This can help you develop a mutually respectful and enjoyable relationship. It’s also important to seek out someone with a similar lifestyle. If you’re a homebody who loves quiet nights in, for example, you may not be compatible with someone who thrives on a busy social life. By finding someone with a similar approach to life, you’ll be more likely to find long-term happiness together. Communication is key in any relationship, and that certainly holds true in dating. Work on your communication skills and be open, honest, and transparent about what you’re looking for in a relationship. This can help you avoid misunderstandings and build a stronger connection with your partner. Finally, remember that not every connection will click. If you don’t feel chemistry with a particular person, it’s okay to move on and keep looking for someone who is more compatible.

They concern the flawed Fast and Furious operation. Hundreds of weapons were lost or unaccounted for. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"The US Justice Department has sent documents to Congress related to the infamous \\"Fast and Furious\\" operation. The documents concern the flawed operation in which hundreds of weapons were lost or unaccounted for. The operation was designed to track guns being sold illegally in the US and smuggled into Mexico. However, it went awry and several of the guns ended up in the hands of criminals, including those responsible for the death of US Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry in 2010. The documents sent to Congress by the Justice Department reportedly include communications between senior officials discussing the operation and its aftermath. The operation was widely condemned as a failure, and the Justice Department has come under heavy criticism for its handling of the situation. The \\"Fast and Furious\\" operation was launched in 2006, and continued until 2011. It aimed to investigate and track the sale of illegal firearms in the US, and the subsequent smuggling of these guns into Mexico. However, a number of the guns ended up in the wrong hands, with tragic consequences. In addition to Agent Terry's death, a number of other individuals were killed or injured as a result of the operation. The Justice Department's decision to release the documents to Congress is a significant development, and is likely to attract considerable media attention. Many will be keen to scrutinize the contents of these documents and understand what led to the failure of the \\"Fast and Furious\\" operation. There will also be questions about whether the Justice Department could have done more to prevent the operation from going wrong, and what steps it is taking to address the situation. Overall, the release of these documents is a reminder of the tragic consequences of the \\"Fast and Furious\\" operation. It is hoped that lessons have been learned from this failed operation, and that measures are being taken to ensure that such mistakes are not repeated in the future."},{"prompt":"the premise Men and women view cows, guns and symbols in pieces in a art gallery. true if People are enjoying their time?

It is a combination of an exhaustdriven turbocharger and an enginedriven supercharger, each mitigating the weaknesses of the other. A beltdriven or shaftdriven supercharger offers exceptional response and lowrpm performance as it has no lag time between the application of throttle and pressurization of the manifold (assuming that it is a positivedisplacement supercharger such as a Roots type or twinscrew and not a Centrifugal compressor supercharger, which does not provide boost until the engine has reached higher RPMs). When combined with a large turbocharger if the \`\`turbo'' was used by itself, it would offer unacceptable lag and poor response in the lowrpm range the proper combination of the two can offer a zerolag powerband with high torque at lower engine speeds and increased power at the higher end. Twincharging is therefore desirable for smalldisplacement motors (such as VW's 1.4TSI), especially those with a large operating rpm, since they can take advantage of an artificially broad torque band over a large speed range.

However, it was not until 1158, over 30 years later, that Alfonso finally replaced his cousin, Henry II, as King of Castile. During his years as heir, Alfonso learned the art of ruling and warfare, leading Castilian armies into battle against both Christian and Muslim opponents. In 1135, his father died and Alfonso became the nominal ruler of Castile, although his mother and stepfather, who were regents, held most of the power. Despite this, Alfonso continued to build his own power base and gradually gained more influence at court. In 1146, he married Berenguela of Barcelona, which strengthened his ties to other important kingdoms in the region. In the meantime, his cousin Henry II had become King of Castile in 1157. However, Henry's rule was unpopular and his efforts to enforce his authority were met with resistance. In 1158, Alfonso finally felt strong enough to challenge Henry's right to the throne, despite the fact that he had sworn loyalty to Henry earlier. After several months of political maneuvering and military campaigns, Alfonso emerged victorious and was crowned King of Castile on July 1, 1158. While he faced many challenges during his reign, including conflicts with neighboring kingdoms and internal rebellions, Alfonso proved to be a skilled and effective monarch, ruling until his death in 1214.

One of the best ways to attract hummingbirds to your backyard is by using a hummingbird feeder. However, it is important to know how to properly maintain the feeder to keep the hummingbirds happy and healthy. The first step is to fill your hummingbird feeder and keep the rest in storage. Hummingbirds are attracted to fresh nectar, so it is best to only fill the feeder halfway to prevent any waste. This will also make it easier to change the nectar more frequently. Speaking of changing the nectar, it is important to do so every few days. Hummingbirds are very sensitive and can become ill from drinking old nectar. You can tell if the nectar is bad by looking for cloudiness or any signs of mold. Be sure to clean the feeder thoroughly before adding new nectar. To clean the hummingbird feeder, a mixture of vinegar and hot water is the most effective. You can soak the feeder in the solution for up to an hour and then scrub it with a bottle brush to remove any residue. Rinse the feeder thoroughly with hot water and allow it to air dry before refilling it with fresh nectar. By following these simple steps, you can attract and care for hummingbirds in your backyard. It is important to remember that hummingbirds are delicate creatures and require proper care to thrive. With a little effort, you can provide a safe and enjoyable environment for these beautiful birds."},{"prompt":"What happens next in this paragraph?

Massage the shaving cream into your skin. Use gentle downward strokes while shaving. Use gentle pressure with an electric razor. Consider using a depilatory cream instead of shaving. Moisturize your face after shaving.","completion":"When it comes to achieving a smooth and irritation-free shave, there are several steps you can take in your shaving routine to make that happen. Here are a few tips to help you elevate your shave game: Firstly, before you shave, it's always beneficial to give yourself a hot towel treatment. This helps to open up your pores so that hair removal is easier and more comfortable. Simply wet a towel with hot water and place it on your face for a few minutes before you begin shaving. When selecting a shaving cream, it's best to choose a gentle one that includes natural ingredients such as aloe vera. These types of creams help to soothe and calm the skin while also ensuring a close shave. Apply a generous amount of shaving cream to your skin and massage it in using circular motions. This will create a protective layer between your skin and the razor, reducing the risk of cuts and irritation. When it comes to the actual shaving process, using gentle downward strokes rather than upward or side-to-side strokes is preferred. This helps to minimize irritation and prevent razor burn. It's also important to use gentle pressure with an electric razor, ensuring that you don't press too hard against your skin. If you find that shaving isn't working for you, or if you have particularly sensitive skin, consider using a depilatory cream instead. These creams dissolve hair at the root, providing a longer-lasting smoothness without the need for shaving. Just make sure to follow the instructions carefully and do a patch test first to check for any adverse reactions. Finally, after you've finished shaving, it's important to moisturize your face to keep it hydrated and smooth. A non-greasy moisturizer that contains natural ingredients like shea butter or coconut oil is ideal for post-shave care. Apply it liberally to your skin to keep it feeling soft and supple. By following these tips, you can ensure that your shaving routine is gentle and effective, leaving your skin smooth, soft and irritation-free."},{"prompt":"Premise: A man wearing a black shirt and blue jeans up in the air holding a plywood in each hand in front of a building that has a word stomp.

Jamie Kirk Hahn, 29, died on Wednesday morning after Monday's attack. Her husband, Nation Hahn, has been treated for his injuries and released.","completion":"Jonathan Broyhill's Lies and the Tragic Consequences Jonathan Broyhill's alleged lies have led to tragic consequences for his victims. The 31-year-old had been telling friends that he had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and multiple sclerosis for the last two years. This was the story he had been telling people to gain sympathy, but it was to cover up his embezzlement scheme. Broyhill had been stealing thousands of dollars from the company where he worked for, and his fraudulent behavior eventually caught up with him. Broyhill was the best man at a friend's wedding that occurred in April. The wedding was for Nation and Jamie Kirk Hahn, a prominent political strategist from North Carolina. After the wedding, Broyhill stayed over at the Hahn's house, and on Monday night, he attacked both Nation and Jamie with a kitchen knife. He inflicted severe wounds to both of them, and Jamie died from her wounds on Wednesday morning despite the best efforts of medical personnel. The investigation found out that Broyhill had stolen more than 50,000 by altering payroll records, and Jamie had discovered his fraud the night of the attack. According to sources, she had always been suspicious of him, and she had asked to see the company's financial records on Monday night. This probably triggered the attack. In the days leading up to the wedding, Broyhill had been active in the preparations and had even led prayers with ministers. When he told his friends about his supposed cancer and MS diagnosis, they were taken aback, but they would offer their support through prayers. The Reverend William Barber, president of the North Carolina NAACP, was asked by the victims' family to pray for Broyhill during the early stages of the investigation. The tragedy serves as a painful reminder of how lies can lead to disastrous consequences. Broyhill's lies not only hurt his victims financially, but it also ultimately led to Jamie's untimely death.

But now the ESA has a simpler concern: Its Philae lander, about the size of a washing machine, might fall off. The main problem is that the lander's harpoons didn't fire upon landing and thus did not anchor the spacecraft onto the comet, reports Wired. Scientists are exploring the idea of trying to refire the harpoons. It wasn't the only glitch. As AP explains, the lander's downward thrusters didn't operate properly, which is perhaps part of the reason that ESA officials think the lander bounced.

It will take more analysis to figure out exactly what happened, reports the BBC, but the probe's first radio contact suggested that all was well for now.

When faced with such circumstances, safety and caution should be the top priority. To ensure safety during and after a natural disaster, take note of some helpful tips. Firstly, it's essential to watch out for damaged areas, such as cracks in walls, broken windows, and weakened structures. These areas can pose a significant risk of injury, and it's essential to keep away from them until they are repaired. In addition, downed electrical lines and flooded areas can also pose a significant danger. To avoid the risks associated with these, keep yourself away from downed power lines and always take the necessary precautions when approaching flooded areas. When a natural disaster strikes, it's essential to turn off all electrical and gas lines to prevent potential accidents. Using a stick to check for snakes is also essential, especially in flooded areas that are known to harbor serpents. Always ensure you have a handy stick and check carefully before moving forward. To protect your home from future uncertainties, take pictures of your home for insurance purposes. This helps to have evidence of the damages incurred and can also be helpful when making claims from your insurance company. Furthermore, make repairs to your home as soon as possible to prevent further damage and ensure safety. Lastly, cleaning your home after a natural disaster can seem like a daunting task, but it's crucial. Cleaning your home helps eliminate hazards and discomfort that may arise from the debris left behind. Furthermore, it helps restore your property to its pre-disaster state and can help keep you and your family healthy and safe. In conclusion, safety should be paramount when faced with natural disasters. Taking the necessary precautions to ensure safety and security can save lives and properties. Always remember to watch out for damaged areas, avoid downed electrical lines and flooded areas, turn off all electrical and gas lines, use a stick to check for snakes, take pictures of your home for insurance purposes, make repairs, and clean your home after a natural disaster."},{"prompt":"Q: how many episodes in season 9 of grey's anatomy?","completion":"There are 24 episodes in season 9 of Grey's Anatomy."},{"prompt":"Write an article based on this Create a focal point.

However, creating a beautiful and balanced arrangement can be a daunting task. There are a few key principles to keep in mind when creating a stunning floral display. First, create a focal point. This can be a large or unique flower, a group of flowers of the same color, or even a decorative object that complements the flowers. The focal point should be the centerpiece of the arrangement and draw the eye in. Second, create balance. Use flowers of different heights, shapes, and sizes to create visual interest and balance within the arrangement. It's important to place larger flowers at the bottom and smaller ones towards the top, creating a tapering effect. Third, create variety. Use different textures and shapes of flowers to create a diverse and dynamic arrangement. Combining spiky, round, and flowing shapes will add depth and interest. Fourth, rotate the vase. As you add flowers, turn the vase to ensure the arrangement looks good from all angles. This will help you maintain proportion and balance as you work. Fifth, tie it all together. Add foliage around the edges of the vase or a ribbon tied around the arrangement to add cohesion and polish. Finally, if some of your flowers begin to wilt or die, don't be afraid to remove them or reuse them in a different arrangement. Dead flowers can also add an interesting and rustic look to an arrangement if utilized properly.

Tension between Macedon and Rome increased when the young king of Macedon, Philip V harbored one of the chief pirates, Demetrius of Pharos (a former client of Rome). As a result, in an attempt to reduce Roman influence in the Balkans, Philip allied himself with Carthage after Hannibal had dealt the Romans a massive defeat at the Battle of Cannae (216 BC) during the Second Punic War. Forcing the Romans to fight on another front when they were at a nadir of manpower gained Philip the lasting enmity of the Romans; the only real result from the somewhat insubstantial First Macedonian War (215–202 BC).

Gary Agar and his brother-in-law, Andrew Lagan, made £2.65 million from the scam before being caught out. The pair claimed to be selling tickets for popular acts including Sir Paul McCartney, Jay-Z, and Kings of Leon. However, they had no actual tickets and were simply taking customers' money. The money was then siphoned off into various accounts in locations such as Thailand and Hungary. A money exchange in Victoria, central London, was also used to withdraw £1.5 million. At Harrow Crown Court today, the judge handed down an eight-year sentence to each of the men. This highlights the severity of the crime and serves as a warning to others who would try to profit from similar scams. It is a sad fact that scams such as this one are all too common. Customers need to be aware of the risks involved in buying tickets online and take steps to protect themselves. One such step is to only buy from reputable sources, and to always check the seller's credentials before making a purchase. Ultimately, the actions of Agar and Lagan have had a devastating impact on the customers who fell victim to their scam. Hopefully, this sentence will serve as a warning to others and help prevent similar crimes in the future."},{"prompt":"Are these paraphrases?

The first step is to check the label of your pillow to determine if it is washable. Some pillows have special requirements for cleaning and may need to be dry cleaned or spot cleaned only. Once you confirm that your pillow can indeed be washed, remove it from the pillowcase and start by filling up a sink or bathtub with hot water. Add a gentle laundry detergent to the water and stir until it's well mixed. Submerge the pillow in the water and massage it gently for a few minutes. Be sure to pay extra attention to any stained or soiled areas on the pillow. After a few minutes, drain the soapy water and refill the sink or bathtub with clean, hot water. Rinse the pillow until the water runs clear to remove any traces of detergent. Then, using a dry towel, press out excess water from the pillow. Be careful not to twist or wring the pillow as this can cause it to lose its shape. Finally, it's time to dry your pillow. You can do this by hanging it outside in the sun, placing it in the dryer on a low heat setting, or even using a hair dryer on a low, cool setting. Be sure to fluff the pillow periodically while drying to help it maintain its shape. In conclusion, washing a pillow is a simple process as long as you follow the proper steps. Always check the label to ensure that your pillow can be washed, use a gentle laundry detergent, and be gentle when massaging and drying your pillow.

In order for a bacterium to bind, take up and recombine donor DNA into its own chromosome, it must first enter a special physiological state termed competence (see Natural competence). In Bacillus subtilis, about 40 genes are required for the development of competence. The length of DNA transferred during B. subtilis transformation can be between a third of a chromosome up to the whole chromosome. Transformation appears to be common among bacterial species, and thus far at least 60 species are known to have the natural ability to become competent for transformation. The development of competence in nature is usually associated with stressful environmental conditions, and seems to be an adaptation for facilitating repair of DNA damage in recipient cells.

Here are three ways you can incorporate lavender into your cooking and baking. First, try baking with lavender. The floral, slightly sweet flavor of dried lavender buds adds a unique dimension to baked goods. Recipes such as lavender shortbread cookies or lavender-infused cakes are a popular choice for those looking for something a little different. Remember to use a light touch when adding lavender, as it can quickly overpower other flavors. Next, make a fresh and relaxing tea. Lavender tea is a popular choice for those seeking to promote relaxation and reduce stress. Simply steep a few lavender buds in hot water for a few minutes to make a soothing beverage. For an extra boost, add a teaspoon of honey or lemon juice. Finally, add flavor to your salad. Lavender pairs well with light, fresh flavors, making it an ideal addition to any salad. Try adding a teaspoon of dried lavender to your favorite vinaigrette recipe, or sprinkle a pinch of lavender buds atop a bed of mixed greens for a unique burst of flavor.

However, it took almost two decades for this autonomy to be formalized. In 1929, the Armenian Evangelical Church was officially recognized as an independent denomination by the Armenian government. During these 19 years, the Armenian Evangelical Church underwent significant changes and growth. One of the key figures in this period was Rev. Dr. John G. Krikorian, who served as the Patriarch of the Armenian Evangelical Church from 1913 to 1925. Under his leadership, the church expanded its educational and social programs, and established new congregations throughout the world. In addition to the efforts of Krikorian and other leaders, the Armenian Evangelical Church also benefited from the changing political landscape in Armenia. Following World War I and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Armenia gained independence in 1918. This newfound freedom allowed the Armenian Evangelical Church to establish itself as an independent denomination, free from the constraints of the Armenian Orthodox Church. Despite these positive developments, the formal recognition of the Armenian Evangelical Church as an independent denomination was not without its challenges. The Armenian government was initially hesitant to grant the church formal autonomy, and it wasn't until years of lobbying and negotiations that this recognition was finally secured. In conclusion, it took the Armenian Evangelical Church almost two decades to formalize its autonomy after being granted provisional autonomy in 1910. During this time, the church underwent significant changes and growth, and benefited from both strong leadership and a changing political landscape."},{"prompt":"Do these mean the same?

Put your child in the tub. Gently bathe your child. Pat dry.","completion":"Cleaning your little one can be a tedious task, especially when they have delicate skin. Most parents want to use natural and safe products on their kids, and oats are the perfect solution. Oats have a natural soothing effect on the skin and can help reduce inflammation and itching. In this article, we'll show you how to create an oat sachet that you can use to bathe your child in. The first step is to purchase oats. You can use either colloidal oatmeal or regular oats. Colloidal oatmeal is finely powdered and is easier to work with, but regular oats also work fine. Make sure the oats are unflavored and unsweetened. Next, take a muslin cloth and fill it with the oats, tie it securely with a string, and your oat sachet is ready. The sachet will turn milky in the tub and release the beneficial properties of oats. Fill the bathtub with warm water, but ensure it is not hot. Too hot water can harm the baby's delicate skin. Place the sachet in the tub, and it will release the oats into the bathwater, creating a soothing milky liquid. Gently place your child in the tub and start bathing them. Rub the oat sachet on the baby's skin, allowing the liquid to coat their skin. Allowing the baby to soak for at least 15 minutes will ensure that the soothing benefits of oats work their magic. After bath time is over, pat your child dry with a soft towel. Avoid rubbing their skin harshly as this can cause irritation. Once done, you can dispose of the oat sachet or even use it on yourself during bath time. In conclusion, using oats for your child's bath is a natural and safe way to keep their delicate skin clean and healthy. The oat sachet recipe shared here is quick and easy to make, and a great way to incorporate natural ingredients into your child's bath routine. Give it a try, and watch your child's skin glow with health."},{"prompt":"Write an article based on this Prepare for the side effects of your procedure.

This image entered the historiography of the Second World War in the 1980s and 1990s, especially after the publication of Angus Calder's book The Myth of the Blitz (1991).

Values attached to Latin scholarship and education mostly disappeared, and while literacy remained important, it became a practical skill rather than a sign of elite status. In the 4th century, Jerome (d. 420) dreamed that God rebuked him for spending more time reading Cicero than the Bible. By the 6th century, Gregory of Tours (d. 594) had a similar dream, but instead of being chastised for reading Cicero, he was chastised for learning shorthand. By the late 6th century, the principal means of religious instruction in the Church had become music and art rather than the book. Most intellectual efforts went towards imitating classical scholarship, but some original works were created, along with nowlost oral compositions. The writings of Sidonius Apollinaris (d. 489), Cassiodorus (d. c. 585), and Boethius (d. c. 525) were typical of the age.

However, when it's time to remove the bandage, it's important to do it correctly to prevent infection and damage to the skin. Here's how to remove a bandage safely and effectively. Before attempting to remove the bandage, begin by washing your hands with soap and water. This will minimize the risk of introducing germs to the wound. Then, wash or wipe the bandage and the skin around the bandage clean as best you can. To remove the bandage itself, one helpful solution is to use acetone or nail polish remover.

Once the bandage is lifted off of the skin, it’s important to be gentle and take caution not to damage the underlying tissue. Wipe or rinse the skin and affected area with a clean damp cloth or warm water if needed. In summary, removing a bandage properly can prevent infection and further injury to the wound.

While postpunk musicians often avoided or intentionally obscured conventional influences, previous musical styles did serve as touchstones for the movement, including particular brands of glam, art rock and [the] dark undercurrent of '60s music.[nb 1] According to Reynolds, artists once again approached the studio as an instrument, using new recording methods and pursuing novel sonic territories. Author Matthew Bannister wrote that postpunk artists rejected the high cultural references of 1960s rock artists like the Beatles and Bob Dylan as well as paradigms that defined rock as progressive, as art, as 'sterile' studio perfectionism ... by adopting an avantgarde aesthetic.

Remember to wash everything that came in contact with raw chicken before using it again.","completion":"When cooking chicken, it is essential to ensure that it is cooked thoroughly to avoid any risk of foodborne illness. One way of doing this is by using a meat thermometer. The internal temperature of the chicken should read 165°F (74°C) before removing it from heat. Once it is done, allow it to rest for about 5 minutes before serving. Resting the chicken ensures that the juices redistribute, resulting in tender and juicy meat. To add some more flavor to the dish, consider serving the chicken with a sauce or glaze. Some popular options include barbecue sauce, honey mustard, or teriyaki glaze. However, be sure to choose a sauce or glaze that will complement the flavors of the chicken. It is also crucial to practice good hygiene when handling raw chicken. Any utensils, dishes, or surfaces that came in contact with the raw chicken should be washed thoroughly before using them again. This helps to prevent the spread of harmful bacteria. In conclusion, cooking chicken to the correct temperature and allowing it to rest before serving are essential steps in creating a delicious and safe meal. Adding a flavorful sauce or glaze is also a great way to elevate the dish.
