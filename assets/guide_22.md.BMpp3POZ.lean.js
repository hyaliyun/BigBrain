The run occurred during a Monday Night Football game at the Metrodome in Minneapolis. Dorsett, who played for the Dallas Cowboys from 1977 to 1987, was one of the most explosive running backs of his generation. He rushed for over 1,000 yards in eight of his first nine seasons, including a career-high 1,646 yards in 1981. Dorsett's 99-yard touchdown run occurred in the second quarter of a close game between the Cowboys and the Vikings. Dallas had the ball on their own one-yard line, and Dorsett took a handoff from quarterback Danny White and burst through a hole in the line. Dorsett's speed and agility were on full display as he eluded multiple Vikings defenders and outran the rest of the defense to the end zone. The touchdown gave the Cowboys a 14-0 lead, and they went on to win the game 27-20. The 99-yard touchdown run is one of the most iconic plays in NFL history, and it cemented Dorsett's status as one of the all-time greats at his position.

This artificial fog is most commonly used in professional entertainment applications, but smaller, more affordable fog machines are becoming common for personal use. Fog machines can also be found in use in a variety of industrial, training, and some military applications. Typically, fog is created by vaporizing proprietary water and glycolbased or glycerinbased fluids or through the atomization of mineral oil. This fluid (often referred to colloquially as fog juice) vaporizes or atomizes inside the fog machine. Upon exiting the fog machine and mixing with cooler outside air the vapor condenses, resulting in a thick visible fog.

This could be obtained through a census, survey, or other means of collecting data on the population of the county. Once the demographic data has been collected, the number of individuals who fall outside the age range of 45 to 64 can be determined by subtracting the number of individuals in that age range from the total population of the county. For example, if a county has a total population of 100,000 and 30,000 of those individuals are between the ages of 45 and 64, then the number of individuals who are not between those ages would be 70,000. To determine the percentage of the county's population that falls outside the age range of 45 to 64, divide the number of individuals who are not in that age range by the total population of the county and multiply by 100. Using the example above, the calculation would be as follows: 70,000 / 100,000 x 100 = 70% Therefore, in this hypothetical county, 70% of the population is not between the ages of 45 and 64. It is important to note that demographic data can change over time and can vary from county to county.

Some define a trapezoid as a quadrilateral having only one pair of parallel sides (the exclusive definition), thereby excluding parallelograms. Others define a trapezoid as a quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel sides (the inclusive definition), making the parallelogram a special type of trapezoid. The latter definition is consistent with its uses in higher mathematics such as calculus.

In the late nineteenth century, physicists encountered problems with the classical understanding of time, in connection with the behavior of electricity and magnetism.

They discovered a material called graphene, which is the thinnest material ever discovered at just one atom thick. Their discovery was made by pulling scotch tape off graphite, which is a form of carbon. Graphene is an incredible material for several reasons. Firstly, it is very strong for its size, which makes it useful in a variety of applications. It is also incredibly flexible, which allows it to be used in a range of different products. Additionally, it is an excellent electrical conductor, which means that it can be used in the development of new electronic devices. The discovery of graphene has paved the way for a range of new technologies and applications. One potential use of graphene is in the development of new and improved batteries. Graphene is an excellent conductor of electricity, which means that it could potentially be used to create batteries that are more efficient and longer-lasting than current battery technologies. Another exciting application for graphene is in the development of new materials for use in construction. Graphene is incredibly strong and durable, which makes it ideal for use in building materials that need to withstand extreme conditions. For example, graphene-based composites could potentially be used in the construction of buildings in areas prone to earthquakes or other natural disasters. In conclusion, the discovery of graphene by Andre Geim and Kostya Novoselow in 2004 was a groundbreaking moment in the history of science. This incredible material is the thinnest ever discovered, and it has a range of exciting applications in fields such as electronics, construction, and energy storage.

Field goals are shots taken during game play in which the ball is put through the opponent's hoop without being touched by any player from that team. The number of field goals made in a game can vary widely depending on the skill level of the players, the strategies employed by the coaches, and the overall pace of the game. In a high-scoring game in which both teams are playing aggressively, there may be dozens of field goals made. However, in a low-scoring defensive battle, there may be only a handful of field goals made throughout the entire game. Ultimately, the answer to the question of how many field goals were made in a game can only be determined by examining the game data or by watching a recording of the game and keeping track of each shot made. While there are many factors that can influence the number of field goals made in a game, careful analysis of the data can provide important insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each team and help inform future game strategies."},{"prompt":"f From the top of Mt.

In Franconia, the margraves of Ansbach and Bayreuth as well as the imperial cities were part of this alliance. The Catholic side responded in 1609 with a counteralliance, the League. The conflicts between the two camps ultimately resulted in the Thirty Years' War, which was the greatest strain on the cohesion of the Franconian Circle Initially, Franconia was not a theatre of war, although marauding armies repeatedly crossed its territory. However, in 1631, Swedish troops under Gustavus Adolphus advanced into Franconia and established a large encampment in summer 1632 around Nuremberg. However, the Swedes lost the Battle of the Alte Veste against Wallenstein's troops and eventually withdrew.

The study surveyed 2,000 people and found that by mid-afternoon, many workers lose their focus and productivity levels decrease. The study also found that 60% of respondents feel they deserve an easy Friday due to working more than their contracted hours throughout the week. Workers who regularly put in extra hours may struggle to stay focused and productive as the week progresses. Interestingly, the study found that almost half of respondents had noticed their boss is more lenient on a Friday. This suggests that employers may be aware of the productivity dip and are offering their employees some leniency towards the end of the week. With this in mind, employers may want to consider ways of increasing productivity levels throughout the week to avoid this mid-afternoon slump. Flexible work schedules, prioritizing heavy workload earlier in the week, and promoting healthy habits and breaks may all help to keep workers focused and productive throughout the week. Overall, the British Airways survey provides valuable insights into the mental clock-off phenomenon that many workers experience.

The Lakers have earned the reputation of being nearly unbeatable at their home venue, the Staples Center, and have even set records for their home wins during the regular season. Specifically, the Lakers held the record for most wins at home in the regular season for a total of two seasons. The first time they achieved this feat was during the 1985-86 season, when legendary players like Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar led the team to a 37-4 home record. This impressive record helped the Lakers finish the regular season with a strong 62-20 overall record. The Lakers would go on to hold this record for nearly two decades before they achieved their second record-setting season. This time, it was during the 2008-09 season, when the team's star-studded roster that included Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, and Lamar Odom went an astonishing 36-5 at home. This helped the Lakers finish the regular season with a league-best 65-17 record and ultimately helped them win their 15th championship title in franchise history. It's important to note that while the Lakers have set this record twice, they aren't the only team in the NBA to have achieved this feat.

Bituminous sands are mined using enormous (100 ton capacity) power shovels and loaded into even larger (400 ton capacity) dump trucks for movement to an upgrading facility.

This synthetic substance is fluid enough to be transferred through conventional oil pipelines and can be fed into conventional oil refineries without any further treatment. By 2015 Canadian bitumen upgraders were producing over 1 million barrels (160×10^3 m3) per day of synthetic crude oil, of which 75% was exported to oil refineries in the United States.

Done long before he started drinking heavily he is his classic self in this (and Larry's not bad either). Moe's character is a straight part (mostly) and this movie would be better named The Curley and Larry Movie. Not that any of the Stooges movies were very good (in my opinion), but as one commenter here said, how sad it is that this movie had real potential. The casting was good, it was well directed, filmed, and edited, but the story line tried to be about something serious with just some Stooges antics and musical numbers (which I guess were good back then) thrown in. The best thing you can do for yourself during this movie should you actually believe that it has to be better than mowing the lawn and taking out the trash (which is subject to debate) is to wait for Curley/Larry scenes and sleep or find something in the kitchen to eat during the rest of it.

Before starting, the surface of the table should be cleaned with a mild soap and water solution to remove any dirt or grime. The next step is to remove the finish by sanding the coffee table with a coarse-grit sandpaper. This will strip the existing finish and make it easier for the new stain to take hold. After sanding, it is essential to wipe down the entire coffee table with a clean cloth to remove any wood dust that has accumulated during the sanding process. Once the coffee table has been sanded and wiped clean, it is time to smooth the bare wood surface by sanding it again with fine-grit sandpaper. This will prepare the surface for the new stain or varnish to be applied, giving it a smooth and even finish that looks professional. Finally, it is essential to clean off the coffee table with mineral spirits to get rid of the fine wood dust that remains after sanding. This will ensure that the new finish adheres correctly to the wood, providing a long-lasting and beautiful result. In conclusion, refinishing a coffee table requires careful attention to detail and a few essential steps to ensure a professional-quality finish. By following these guidelines, you can transform your old, worn coffee table into a beautiful centerpiece for your living room while ensuring it lasts for years to come."},{"prompt":"Create a set of triples that describes the content in the following sentence.

The crash, which occurred recently, attracted the attention of local fire officials who quickly responded to the scene. According to one official on the scene, the pilot was \\"very lucky to be able to walk away\\" from the crash. The exact cause of the helicopter crash has not yet been determined, and is currently under investigation. However, initial reports suggest that it was most likely due to mechanical failure. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries or fatalities as a result of the crash. Just south of where the helicopter crashed, another incident occurred involving a small plane. This time, it was an emergency landing near Byron Airport. While there were no reported injuries in this incident either, it is a stark reminder of the dangers that can be present in the skies. These events illustrate the importance of aviation safety, and the need for proper maintenance and training to ensure that pilots and aircraft are kept at the highest possible standards. As the investigation continues into the helicopter crash, it is hoped that valuable lessons can be learned to prevent similar accidents from happening in the future.

The IndoScythians invaded the area of Ujjain and established the Saka era (with their calendar), marking the beginning of the longlived Saka Western Satraps state.

Study provides insight into how chlamydia avoids the human immune system.","completion":"The number of chlamydia cases among young people in England is alarming. According to a report, more than 150,000 individuals under the age of 25 tested positive for chlamydia in 2010. The sexually transmitted infection, caused by the bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis, often goes undetected as it doesn't always show symptoms. This can lead to serious health problems if left untreated, such as infertility or pelvic inflammatory disease. As research into this pervasive STI continues, new insights have emerged as to why the human immune system struggles to combat chlamydia. A study into chlamydia and the immune system has revealed that the bacteria have evolved to manipulate the host's immune response. By producing key enzymes, the chlamydia bacteria triggers a process called autophagy, which is used to fight other bacterial infections. However, chlamydia has evolved to avoid being destroyed by autophagy, allowing it to thrive within the human body. This breakthrough provides valuable information for researchers who are working to develop vaccines and new treatments to combat chlamydia. By identifying the specific mechanisms used by chlamydia to avoid the human immune system, the researchers hope to find ways to disrupt this process and help the body more effectively combat the bacteria. In the meantime, it's essential that young people are educated about the dangers of chlamydia and encouraged to get tested regularly. With the number of cases on the rise, it's crucial that individuals know the risks and take steps to protect themselves and their partners. Awareness campaigns and accessible testing facilities can help to reduce the spread of chlamydia and prevent long-term health problems caused by the infection. In conclusion, the recent study into chlamydia and the immune system has shed light on how the bacteria avoids being detected and destroyed by the host's immune response. This discovery provides hope for future treatments and vaccinations, but it's also vital that young people take steps to protect themselves and get tested regularly to prevent the spread of this potentially dangerous infection."},{"prompt":"Aug 3 Wells Fargo & Co said on Wednesday that it did not experience any material impact on its UK or other foreign businesses as a result of Britain's vote to leave the European Union.

Enter the terminal command touch mt YYYYMMDDhhmm.ss [file path] into the Terminal. Enter the command touch at YYYYMMDDhhmm.ss [file path]. Enter the command touch t YYYYMMDDhhmm.ss [file path].","completion":"Article: How to Modify File Timestamps in OS X Terminal If you want to manipulate the timestamps of your files in macOS, you can use the Terminal application to do it. Changing timestamps can be useful for a variety of reasons, such as preserving the original creation date of a file after copying it or correcting the time stamp if it was accidentally set to the wrong date or time. To modify file timestamps using Terminal, you need to launch the program and find the location of the file you want to work with. Once you know the file path, you can use the touch command to change the file's creation, modification, or access time. The first command you can use is \\"touch -mt,\\" which sets the modification and access time of the file to a specific date and time. To use this command, replace \\"YYYYMMDDhhmm.ss\\" with the desired time stamp and \\"file path\\" with the path to the file. For example, \\"touch -mt 202201011200.00 /Users/username/Documents/myfile.txt\\" will change the modification and access time of \\"myfile.txt\\" to January 1st, 2022 at 12:00 PM. The second command, \\"touch -at,\\" sets the file's access time to the specified timestamp. This means that only the access time will change, while the creation and modification times will remain the same. Use the same format as the previous command, replacing \\"at\\" with the desired access time. For example, \\"touch -at 202201011200.00 /Users/username/Documents/myfile.txt\\" modifies the access time for \\"myfile.txt\\" to the same date and time as before. The third command is \\"touch -t,\\" which changes all three timestamps (creation, modification, and access) to the specified time stamp. Like before, replace \\"t\\" with the desired timestamp, following the same format as above. For instance, \\"touch -t 202201011200.00 /Users/username/Documents/myfile.txt\\" changes all three timestamps to January 1st, 2022 at 12:00 PM. In conclusion, using the Terminal application in OS X is an easy way to change file timestamps. Whether you want to keep the original creation date or update it to match the last modification, the touch command provides you with the flexibility to modify any file's timestamp."},{"prompt":"Answer a question about this article: If any boy produces an outstanding piece of work, it may be Sent Up For Good, storing the effort in the College Archives for posterity.

The pace is a trifle slow, and for my taste not enough tension is developed in the present day scenes. However this is acceptable just to get such a faithful version. If you like Modesty Blaise, you will enjoy it even with its faults, if you just want an action flick with car chases forget it.

Here are the key steps to follow when planting a new lawn: 1. Prepare the area for planting: Before you start planting your new lawn, it's important to properly prepare the area for planting. Remove any weeds, rocks or debris and ensure the soil is levelled and aerated. 2. Choose your grass: There are many different types of grass to choose from and the best one for you depends on your climate, soil type and how much sunlight your lawn will receive. Visit your local garden centre to learn about the different varieties of grass and choose the one that best suits your needs. 3. Install the new lawn: Once you've decided on the type of grass you want, it's time to install the new lawn. You can either use sod, which is pre-grown grass, or you can plant grass seed. Sod is a faster route to a new lawn, but it can be more expensive than grass seed. 4. Water the new lawn: Regardless of which method you choose, it's important to water your new lawn properly. Water your lawn frequently, ideally twice a day, keeping the soil moist but not wet. Over-watering can be just as harmful as under-watering, so be sure to find the right balance. 5. Stay off the new lawn: Finally, it's important to stay off your new lawn until it's fully established. This could take several weeks, depending on the type of grass you've chosen. Walking on the new lawn too soon can cause damage to the roots and delay its growth. By following these key steps, you'll be well on your way to planting a beautiful new lawn that you can enjoy for years to come."},{"prompt":"WeidemanninIreland–enjoyingsuccesssince2009 Generate a sentence using the above character","completion":"\\"Weidemann in Ireland has been successful since 2009.\\""},{"prompt":"evi fountain (fontana di trevi) pictures, photos, facts and information on trevi fountain (fontana di trevi) (rome) 960x1280 Please write the text above using proper case.","completion":"Trevi Fountain (Fontana di Trevi) - Pictures, photos, facts and information on Trevi Fountain (Fontana di Trevi) (Rome) - 960x1280."},{"prompt":"Data: Amatriciana sauce, ingredient, Olive oil Sentence about the following d","completion":"Amatriciana sauce typically includes olive oil as one of its key ingredients."},{"prompt":"Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: It has been almost 5 years since the release of this stylish action flick.I have watched this movie almost 10 times and it a great effort by Gautham.From my perspective,I feel this movie is virtually flawless.

You can predict the angle of the reflected light. Imagine a ball bouncing off a surface. Light can do the same thing. That is, assuming the surface is shiny. So how do you know where light will go after it strikes a shiny surface? It depends on how the light initially strikes the shiny object. Light does not always go straight toward a surface. Therefore, not all light bounces straight back. Sometimes, light can hit a surface at an angle. The angle at which it strikes the surface tells us how it will bounce off. While light is different to a ball, they react in a similar manner. Many sports rely on knowledge of reflection. Pool players know a lot about reflection. They take great care when they strike the pool ball. They need it to go to a certain place. They know the angle it will hit the side of the pool table.

However, with constant use, even the best grill grates can become dirty and caked with grease and grime. Cleaning your grill grate regularly is important to keep your outdoor cooking area safe and hygienic. One popular way to clean grill grates is by using baking soda and water. First, mix a paste of baking soda and water and apply it generously to the grate. Allow it to sit for about 20 minutes, then scrub the surface gently with a grill brush. Rinse with water and let it dry. For especially dirty grates, oven cleaner can be used. Coat the grate with oven cleaner and let it sit overnight. The next day, scrub the grate with a grill brush, rinse it with water and dry. It's important to avoid using metal utensils and harsh cleaners on your grill grates as they can damage the surface. Always use a grill brush with stiff bristles to remove any built-up grime. After cleaning the grate, be sure to continue maintaining it by brushing it after each use. This prevents any leftover residue from building up and makes future cleanings easier. In conclusion, keeping your grill grate clean is crucial for both the taste of your food and the safety of your cooking area. Baking soda and water, along with oven cleaner for especially tough grime, can effectively clean your grill grate.

It has many important functions. The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow.

First of all, you need to decide whether you want a real fur stole or a faux fur stole. If you are an animal-conscious shopper or on a tight budget, a faux fur stole is the better option. It will still give you the luxurious look you want, without any of the ethical concerns that come with real fur.

He has achieved countless records and milestones throughout his career, including four Super Bowl titles and numerous clutch kicks in important games. One question that is frequently asked about Vinatieri is how many field goals over 30 yards he has made. As of the end of the 2019 season, Vinatieri has made an astonishing 298 field goals over 30 yards. This includes efforts from distances ranging from 31 to 57 yards. Vinatieri has attempted 357 field goals from this distance, giving him a conversion rate of 83.5%. This accuracy is an impressive feat for a kicker who has played for over two decades and attempted some of the most crucial kicks in NFL history. It is worth noting that Vinatieri's overall field goal accuracy has declined somewhat in recent years, particularly in the 2019 season when he missed several key kicks. However, this does not diminish his impressive career accomplishments, including his status as the NFL's all-time leading scorer among kickers. In conclusion, Adam Vinatieri has made 298 field goals from over 30 yards in his remarkable NFL career. This is a testament to his skill, accuracy, and ability to come through in pressure situations.

Tiger sharks do attack humans but 'Laverne' had been tamed by the fishermen.","completion":"The Footage of Tortured Tiger Shark Sparks Outrage in Hawaii Recently, footage of Mikey Mccrum and his friends torturing a tiger shark has caused an outcry in Hawaii and online. The 14-ft shark, known affectionately as 'Laverne' by local fishermen, had been tamed and was a well-known sight in the area. However, Mccrum and his gang took advantage of the shark's trust, attracting it with some raw fish before subjecting it to horrific torture. It is believed that the shark was eventually released after being tortured, although it had badly hurt its tail in the struggle. Sadly, this kind of behavior towards marine life is not uncommon in some parts of the world, but it is particularly disturbing when it takes place in a setting such as this. Many people in Hawaii and beyond have expressed their shock and anger, calling for Mikey Mccrum and his accomplices to face punishment for their actions. Tiger sharks are known to be aggressive and can attack humans. However, 'Laverne' had been tamed by the fishermen, and there was no reason for such a brutal attack. The incident has highlighted the importance of treating all animals with respect, even those that can be dangerous. The video of the shark attack swiftly went viral, sparking outrage across social media, with many calling for tighter laws to protect marine life. Hawaii's Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) took to Twitter to condemn the attack, saying that it is unacceptable to harm protected species in this way. They also called on anyone with information about the incident to come forward. In conclusion, the footage of Mikey Mccrum and his friends torturing a tiger shark has caused understandable outrage. 'Laverne' had become a beloved fixture in the area, and the shameless act of cruelty has left many people shocked and appalled. It is vital that we all play our part in protecting marine life and calling out those who would seek to harm it. The hope is that this incident will raise awareness of the need for greater respect and care for all creatures living in our oceans."},{"prompt":"Q: who are the supreme court justices right now?","completion":"As of September 2021, the current Supreme Court justices in the US are: 1.

It's what causes food to turn brown when you cook it, notes a video from the American Chemical Society featured at Time. All kinds of different compounds are created in the process.

Another key element of cooked bacon's unique smell appears to come from those compounds that contain nitrogen, which add to the meaty aroma.

They saw in the logical symbolism elaborated by Frege (1848–1925) and Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) a powerful instrument that could rationally reconstruct all scientific discourse into an ideal, logically perfect, language that would be free of the ambiguities and deformations of natural language. This gave rise to what they saw as metaphysical pseudoproblems and other conceptual confusions. By combining Frege's thesis that all mathematical truths are logical with the early Wittgenstein's idea that all logical truths are mere linguistic tautologies, they arrived at a twofold classification of all propositions: the analytic (a priori) and the synthetic (a posteriori). On this basis, they formulated a strong principle of demarcation between sentences that have sense and those that do not: the socalled verification principle. Any sentence that is not purely logical, or is unverifiable is devoid of meaning. As a result, most metaphysical, ethical, aesthetic and other traditional philosophical problems came to be considered pseudoproblems.

According to the biographical notes, Fishburne never received any professional training as an actor. Perhaps this explains why his acting, in this beautifully edited film, comes over as so believable and so powerful. Instead of chewing the scenery in the approved fashion for such highpowered roles, Fishburne's portrayal is focused more on Othello's love for his wife, and on his profound sadness at her supposed betrayal, than on violence and vengeance. In a word, the performance is understated, and made far more impressive by Fishburne's extremely intelligent interpretation than it otherwise would have been.

Limbering up and adopting a deep stance not only help prevent injury but also improve your performance. Limbering Up Limbering up refers to a set of exercises or movements that aim to loosen up the muscles, increase blood flow, and prepare the body for physical exertion. This can include stretching, dynamic movements, and breathing exercises. Limbering up can help increase flexibility, reduce muscle tension, and improve range of motion. It is essential to start your exercise or sports routine with some gentle warm-up exercises to prevent injury and prepare your muscles and joints for more intense activity. Adopting a Deep Stance Adopting a deep stance means maintaining a proper posture when performing physical activities. It refers to a position where feet are shoulder-width apart, knees are bent, and hips are pushed back. This stance helps engage the core muscles, protect the lower back, and improve balance and stability. In sports, adopting a deep stance is essential, especially in basketball, volleyball, and tennis, where maintaining balance and mobility are critical. Why is it Important? Proper warm-up and good posture are both essential for preventing injuries and improving performance. Limbering up can help reduce the risk of muscle strains, sprains, and other injuries that may occur during exercise or sports activities. Adopting a deep stance can improve your balance, reduce the risk of falls, and prevent lower back pain. It can also help you generate more power with your movements and increase endurance. In conclusion, before engaging in any physical activity, it is essential to warm up properly and adopt a deep stance. Limbering up prepares your body for physical activity, while adopting a deep stance helps maintain proper posture and improve performance.

This means that a small change in voltage can cause a large change in current. If the applied voltage exceeds the LED's forward voltage drop by a small amount, the current rating may be exceeded by a large amount, potentially damaging or destroying the LED. The typical solution is to use constantcurrent power supplies to keep the current below the LED's maximum current rating. Since most common power sources (batteries, mains) are constantvoltage sources, most LED fixtures must include a power converter, at least a currentlimiting resistor. However, the high resistance of threevolt coin cells combined with the high differential resistance of nitridebased LEDs makes it possible to power such an LED from such a coin cell without an external resistor.
