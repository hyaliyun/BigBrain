Talk to a nutritionist or dietitian if you're struggling to put on weight or if you have any dietary restrictions.

DIY craft tutorials are widely available online, so there's no shortage of inspiration for those looking to get started.

The Coast Guard has conducted an extensive search of over 4000 square miles, but has been forced to suspend their efforts after failing to locate the missing crew members. The Cheeki Rafiki left Antigua on May 3rd with the four sailors on board, bound for the UK. On Thursday, the sailors made a distress call to Falmouth Coastguard, reporting that their vessel was taking on water. The Coastguard immediately launched a search and rescue operation, deploying an aircraft and two lifeboats. On Friday, the crew of a container ship reported sighting an upturned hull, which was initially thought to be the Cheeki Rafiki. However, upon investigation, it was determined that the hull was from a different vessel. Despite this setback, the search continued throughout the weekend with no success in locating the missing sailors. The suspension of the search has left family and friends of the crew members devastated. The missing sailors have been identified as Andrew Bridge, 22, James Male, 22, Steve Warren, 52, and Paul Goslin, 56. A crowdfunding campaign has been launched to help fund an independent search and rescue mission, which has already raised thousands of pounds. The incident has highlighted the dangers and unpredictability of sailing, even for experienced sailors. The Cheeki Rafiki had reportedly undergone a refit in 2013 and was equipped with the latest safety equipment, including a life raft and satellite phone. Despite this, the vessel was unable to withstand the heavy seas it encountered. As the search for the missing sailors is suspended, many are left hoping for a miracle that they will be found safe and well.

If you crave something out of the ordinary, the Death in the Afternoon, Absinthe Sazerac, and Kalashnikov shots are worth a sip. The Death in the Afternoon was invented by renowned author Ernest Hemingway, who mixed champagne and absinthe to create this legendary cocktail. It's simple to make but packs a punch. Start by pouring chilled champagne into a flute glass, then pour a measure of absinthe over a sugar cube placed on a slotted spoon on top of the glass. The mixture will foam, creating a delicious, refreshing cocktail. A twist on the classic New Orleans Sazerac, the Absinthe Sazerac is made with whiskey, bitters, and absinthe. Begin by chilling a rocks glass with ice, stirring a sugar cube with a measure of absinthe, and discarding the excess. Next, in a shaker, mix whiskey and bitters and add it to the glass. Garnish with a lemon twist, and you have yourself an extra-special cocktail. Finally, for those who want something more adventurous, the Kalashnikov shot is a unique experience. It is comprised of Russian vodka and Tabasco sauce with a traditional lemon wedge, presented with a single bullet from an AK-47 as a souvenir. The shot is named after the iconic AK-47 assault rifle and provides a true taste of Russian culture.

Not only do they add a touch of elegance and charm, they're also incredibly easy to create. The first step in creating your tulle table skirt is to measure the circumference of your table. This will ensure that you purchase enough tulle to cover the entirety of the table. Once you have this measurement, wrap elastic around the table and secure it in the back. This will be the foundation for your tulle skirt. Once you have your elastic in place, it's time to purchase spools of tulle. You can find tulle in almost any color and it's fairly inexpensive. Cut your tulle into strips that are twice the height of your table, ensuring that they're even in length. The easiest way to do this is to fold a piece of tulle in half, measure to the height of your table, and then cut across the fold. To attach the tulle to the elastic, start by securing the first strip to the elastic with a slip-knot. Simply fold the tulle in half, place the loop behind the elastic, and then pull the tails through the loop and tighten. This will create a secure knot that won't easily come undone. Continue to tie the tulle strips around the table until the elastic is full. As you tie the tulle strips, try to keep them close together to create a full and fluffy look. You can also vary the colors of tulle to create a pattern or ombre effect. Once you have finished tying all your tulle to the elastic, turn the table over and trim any excess tulle. With just a few simple steps, you can create a beautiful tulle table skirt that will add a touch of elegance to any event.

Brain tissue in its natural state is too soft to work with, but it can be hardened by immersion in alcohol or other fixatives, and then sliced apart for examination of the interior.

This is because his body may have difficulty acclimatizing to the abundance of oxygen in the low-altitude environment. One of the most fascinating adaptations of Dr Sutcliffe‚Äôs body is the opening of an artery that usually closes shortly after birth. This opening, known as patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), allows blood to bypass the lungs and flow directly to the body. In most cases, PDAs close within a few days or weeks of birth. However, in Dr Sutcliffe‚Äôs case, exposure to high altitudes has forced the artery to remain open, providing him with an additional source of oxygen-rich blood. While this adaptation has undoubtedly aided Dr Sutcliffe‚Äôs incredible feats of mountain climbing, it‚Äôs important to note that PDAs can pose significant health risks to an individual, such as heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, or even death. Fortunately, in Dr Sutcliffe‚Äôs case, the open artery has actually saved his life. Had the artery been closed, he would not have been able to acclimatize to the high altitudes, and his climbing journey may have had a very different outcome. Dr Sutcliffe‚Äôs story is a testament to the incredible ways in which the human body can adapt in the face of extreme conditions. However, it is important to remember that these adaptations can come with serious health risks and should not be taken lightly."},{"prompt":"ere are some concepts: image, student, work What is a sentence about these concepts?","completion":"The student submitted their work with an accompanying image."},{"prompt":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: The former Isanti County Courthouse, located at 237 2nd Avenue, South West, corner of Birch Street, in Cambridge, Minnesota, United States, is an historic twostory redbrick county courthouse built in 1888.

In the case of a transmitter, however, the desired matching impedance might not correspond to the dynamic output impedance of the transmitter as analyzed as a source impedance but rather the design value (typically 50 ohms) required for efficient and safe operation of the transmitting circuitry. The intended impedance is normally resistive but a transmitter (and some receivers) may have additional adjustments to cancel a certain amount of reactance in order to tweak the match. When a transmission line is used in between the antenna and the transmitter (or receiver) one generally would like an antenna system whose impedance is resistive and near the characteristic impedance of that transmission line in order to minimize the standing wave ratio (SWR) and the increase in transmission line losses it entails, in addition to supplying a good match at the transmitter or receiver itself.

To trim the edges of the duct tape, you will need a pair of sharp scissors, a ruler or straight edge, and a cutting mat or a clean and flat surface. Lay the tape on the cutting mat or flat surface and use the ruler to mark the edge where you want to cut. Make sure to measure twice and cut once to avoid mistakes. Then, using the scissors, cut along the marked line in a straight motion. Once you have trimmed the edges, it is essential to seal them to prevent fraying or peeling. To do this, simply fold the trimmed edges over onto themselves, creating a clean edge. Then, apply a piece of duct tape widthwise over the folded edge, making sure to apply pressure to ensure it sticks. Repeat this on both sides of the tape to fully seal the edges. Trimming and sealing the edges of duct tape may seem like a small and insignificant detail, but it goes a long way in improving the overall look and durability of your DIY project.

The estimated population of Europe grew from 35 to 80 million between 1000 and 1347, although the exact causes remain unclear: improved agricultural techniques, the decline of slaveholding, a more clement climate and the lack of invasion have all been suggested. As much as 90 per cent of the European population remained rural peasants. Many were no longer settled in isolated farms but had gathered into small communities, usually known as manors or villages. These peasants were often subject to noble overlords and owed them rents and other services, in a system known as manorialism. There remained a few free peasants throughout this period and beyond, with more of them in the regions of Southern Europe than in the north. The practice of assarting, or bringing new lands into production by offering incentives to the peasants who settled them, also contributed to the expansion of population.

During his tenure, Parry-Jones oversaw thousands of job cuts and pay reductions, leading many to question his ethics in regards to the welfare of council employees. Perhaps even more concerning, however, was the revelation that Parry-Jones had been given a ¬£90,000 Porsche Panamera as part of his contract. While some may argue that such a vehicle is necessary for a person in a high-ranking position, the fact remains that it is an extravagant luxury that most council workers could only dream of.

This amount has caused considerable outrage amongst residents of Pembrokeshire, many of whom feel that it is simply too much for someone who oversaw such drastic cuts and reductions. A public petition calling for Parry-Jones' resignation over allegations of corruption within the council has also gained significant support.

This significant event has contributed to the 2 per cent increase in global population, as birth is the primary way for it to occur. The zoo's breeding program has had a particular focus on the Siamese crocodile, a critically endangered species found in Southeast Asia. Swampy habitats and the overhunting of crocodiles have reduced their wild population to a thousand or fewer. It is therefore hopeful that the eight newly born reptiles will be used to boost the dwindling population of crocodiles in Cambodia. The Crocodiles of the World breeding program is based on a system that replicates the conditions of the wild population, which offers the young crocs the ideal environment to develop safely. The zoo also offers grooming services and support to the Siamese crocodile's international breed registry to strengthen genetic variability. As a conservation zoo, Crocodiles of the World allows visitors to close encounters with an array of crocodiles, including saltwater crocs, American alligators, and even the Indian gharials. The zoo's breeding programs provide a vital contribution to the conservation of these and other endangered species. Shaun Foggett, the zoo's founder, is dedicated to providing a safe haven for the world's crocodiles, protecting them from the threats of illegal hunting, habitat loss, and climate change.

The fourth, Anna Vasquez, had already been released.","completion":"Three women from San Antonio, namely Elizabeth Ramirez, Kristie Mayhugh, and Cassandra Rivera, were finally released on Monday after a judge ruled to vacate their 1998 conviction for sexually assaulting two young children. The release of the three marked the end of a long and painful journey for the group, who have become known as the San Antonio 4. The case first began in 1994, when the four women were accused of sexually assaulting two young girls. At the time, all four women vehemently denied the allegations, but were ultimately convicted and sentenced to lengthy prison terms. However, in the years that followed, serious doubts about the validity of the case began to emerge. In the end, DNA evidence proved that the women were not guilty, and they were eventually exonerated. The first to be released was Anna Vasquez, who was granted parole in 2012. It took almost a decade longer for the remaining three to be finally freed. While the release of the San Antonio 4 is a huge relief to the women and their families, it's also a stark reminder of the flaws in the criminal justice system. The case against the women was based on questionable evidence, and yet they were still convicted and imprisoned for years. This is a clear example of why we need to be vigilant in protecting people's rights and in ensuring that the truth always prevails. The San Antonio 4 case is also a triumph of perseverance and determination. Despite the odds being against them, the women never gave up on proving their innocence. They remained committed to each other and to their cause, and eventually justice prevailed. In the end, the release of Elizabeth Ramirez, Kristie Mayhugh, and Cassandra Rivera is a powerful reminder that the criminal justice system is not perfect. Mistakes can and do happen, but we must always be willing to acknowledge them and to work towards a more just and fair system."},{"prompt":"Attributes: name = Giraffe, eatType = pub, food = French, area = city centre, familyFriendly = no.

A U.S. district judge issued a temporary restraining order on the ban earlier this month. The lead plaintiff says the amendment violates the First Amendment. Backers cite a judge's refusal to grant a restraining order against a husband accused of rape.","completion":"In Oklahoma, voters approved an amendment that prohibits the use of Islamic law in state courts. However, a U.S. district judge issued a temporary restraining order on the ban, stating that it could violate the First Amendment. The lead plaintiff in the case argues that the amendment is discriminatory against Muslims and infringes upon their freedom of religion. Proponents of the amendment cite a case in which a judge refused to grant a restraining order against a husband accused of raping his wife, citing that the man's religious beliefs allowed him to have sexual relations with his spouse without her consent. They argue that the use of Sharia law in such cases contradicts American values and should not be allowed. However, opponents argue that the ban on Islamic law is unnecessary, as the U.S. Constitution already supersedes any foreign legal systems or religious laws. They also point out that the amendment may have unintended consequences, such as preventing businesses from using Islamic financial practices, which could negatively impact the state's economy. Overall, the debate over the use of Islamic law in state courts highlights the tension between religious freedom and American values. While proponents argue that the ban is necessary to protect women's rights and prevent discrimination, opponents argue that it could lead to a slippery slope of limiting religious practices and freedoms. Ultimately, the legal battle over the Oklahoma amendment will have important implications for the relationship between religion and the law in the United States."},{"prompt":"Write a dialog about anything you w","completion":"Sure!

By the beginning of the 15th century, the Ottoman advance meant that Byzantine territory in Greece was limited mainly to its thenlargest city, Thessaloniki, and the Peloponnese (Despotate of the Morea). After the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453, the Morea was the last remnant of the Byzantine Empire to hold out against the Ottomans. However, this, too, fell to the Ottomans in 1460, completing the Ottoman conquest of mainland Greece. With the Turkish conquest, many Byzantine Greek scholars, who up until then were largely responsible for preserving Classical Greek knowledge, fled to the West, taking with them a large body of literature and thereby significantly contributing to the Renaissance.","completion":"The title of this article is not provided."},{"prompt":"Generate a sentence that includes all the following words: carry, forest, sle","completion":"I watched as the lumberjack used a sleigh to carry the chopped logs through the dense forest."},{"prompt":"Squidward is the reluctant neighbour and workmate of which children's cartoon character?","completion":"SpongeBob SquarePants."},{"prompt":"ere is some data: United States, leaderTitle, President of the United States; United States, demonym, Americans; Albany, Georgia, isPartOf, Dougherty County, Georgia; United States, ethnicGroup, Asian Americans; Albany, Georgia, country, United States.

Party host was Julie Myers, head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

At first, Myers and other judges praised the man for the costume's \\"originality.\\" However, a number of guests were offended by what they saw as a racially insensitive costume, and Myers later apologized via email to her employees. Even in today's supposedly more enlightened society, it's still far too common for people to make racial or cultural insensitivities part of their Halloween celebrations. In this case, the man in the prison outfit clearly crossed a line by putting on darkened skin make-up that was meant to represent a person of color. It's important to remember that cultural sensitivity isn't something that applies only to people from marginalized groups. It's essential for everyone to be aware of how their words and actions might affect others. This situation shows how easy it can be to offend even people who might not initially identify as being part of a marginalized group. In the end, while the incident at Myers' party was certainly unfortunate, it also serves as a meaningful reminder that we all need to be mindful of how we interact with people from different backgrounds. Whether it's an ill-conceived Halloween costume or simply the way we talk to or about someone who's different from us, it's essential to remember that we're all in this together. By being more aware of what might offend others, we can all work toward creating a more inclusive and compassionate world."},{"prompt":"Write an article based on this summary: Try Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to change your thinking.

By changing the way that one thinks about situations, CBT can help individuals to gain a more positive and productive perspective. CBT can also be a valuable tool for expecting parents, as it can help them to manage worry and anxiety about the arrival of their child. Another way to improve mental health is to try bright light therapy, especially in the winter months when sunlight is scarce.

Alternatively, spending more time outside in natural sunlight can be helpful for improving mood and energy levels.

Build the coop with wood planks. Keep the coop floor dry.","completion":"Building a coop is an essential step when it comes to raising chickens in your backyard. Not only does it provide a safe and comfortable shelter for your birds, but it also helps protect them from predators and harsh weather conditions. One of the key factors to consider when building a coop is the material you use. Wood planks are a popular choice due to their durability and natural insulation properties. When building your coop with wood planks, it is important to select high-quality, untreated wood that is resistant to rot and pests. Pine, cedar, and redwood are excellent options for this purpose. The thickness of the planks should be at least ¬æ inches to ensure stability and support for the structure. It is also essential to keep the coop floor dry at all times. A damp environment is not only uncomfortable for the birds but could also lead to illnesses such as respiratory infections. To achieve this, the coop floor should be built with a slight slope to allow for proper drainage.

Multiracial Americans are Americans who have mixed ancestry of two or more races.

In the 2010 US census, approximately 9 million individuals, or 2.9% of the population, selfidentified as multiracial. There is evidence that an accounting by genetic ancestry would produce a higher number, but people live according to social and cultural identities, not DNA. Historical reasons, including slavery creating a racial caste and the EuropeanAmerican suppression of Native Americans, often led people to identify or be classified by only one ethnicity, generally that of the culture in which they were raised. Prior to the mid20th century, many people hid their multiracial heritage because of racial discrimination against minorities.

For example, if you're considering a new job opportunity, researching the benefits package offered can help you determine if the position is a good fit for you. Similarly, if you're thinking about investing in a new technology, understanding the potential benefits of that technology can help you decide if it's worth the cost. However, it's equally important to consider the potential disadvantages of any decision. Failure to do so can leave you unprepared for the consequences of your actions, which can ultimately lead to regret or even financial loss. For example, if you're considering investing in a new business venture, it's important to understand the potential financial risks associated with that investment before putting any money on the line.

Even the larger systems tend to be mounted on trailers and are designed to be fairly quickly broken down or set up. In the past, this was not always the case. Early missile systems were cumbersome and required much infrastructure; many could not be moved at all. With the diversification of air defence there has been much more emphasis on mobility. Most modern systems are usually either selfpropelled (i.e. guns or missiles are mounted on a truck or tracked chassis) or easily towed. Even systems that consist of many components (transporter/erector/launchers, radars, command posts etc.) benefit from being mounted on a fleet of vehicles. In general, a fixed system can be identified, attacked and destroyed whereas a mobile system can show up in places where it is not expected. Soviet systems especially concentrate on mobility, after the lessons learnt in the Vietnam war between the USA and Vietnam. For more information on this part of the conflict, see SA2 Guideline.

Although many civilians had used them as such during the First World War, the government in 1939 refused to allow the stations to be used as shelters so as not to interfere with commuter and troop travel, and the fears that occupants might refuse to leave. Underground officials were ordered to lock station entrances during raids; but by the second week of heavy bombing the government relented and ordered the stations to be opened. Each day orderly lines of people queued until 4 pm, when they were allowed to enter the stations. In midSeptember 1940 about 150,000 a night slept in the Underground, although by the winter and spring months the numbers had declined to 100,000 or less.

Open yourself to the possibility of being hurt. Feel love as an addiction. Celebrate your love's success without jealousy. Love yourself.","completion":"When it comes to romantic relationships, it's important to take some time to consider whether the person you're interested in is worth your love or not. Are they kind, supportive, and respectful? Do they treat you well and make you happy? If the answer is yes, then it might be worth opening yourself up to the possibility of being hurt. Love is a beautiful thing, but it can also be painful at times. One way to think about love is as an addiction. Just like any other addiction, love can be intense and all-consuming. You might find yourself unable to focus on anything else, constantly daydreaming about the person you love, and feeling a physical ache when they're not around. While this can be overwhelming at times, it's also a sign that you truly care about someone. It's also important to celebrate the success of your love, even if it's not with you. If the person you love is happy and fulfilled, that's something to be happy about, even if it's not with you. Jealousy can be a destructive force in relationships, so try to focus on your own happiness and growth, rather than getting too caught up in what others are doing. Finally, don't forget to love yourself. It's hard to give love to others if you don't love yourself first. Take care of yourself, set boundaries, and make time for the things that bring you joy. When you love yourself, you'll be better equipped to give love to others and build healthy, fulfilling relationships."},{"prompt":"Write the following list of characters into a correctly formed sentence: ¬πComparedtoindustrialhandheldinfraredcameraswith320x240detectorresolutionasofOctober14,2014.","completion":"On October 14, 2014, industrial handheld infrared cameras with 320x240 detector resolution were compared."},{"prompt":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","completion":"Context: In recent years, there has been a significant rise in the number of social media users.

This short amount of time will still soften buildup on the dentures without damaging the metal clasps on the partial dentures. If you notice heavy deposits of tartar (called calculus) starting to congregate on your dentures, it is time to start soaking them overnight in the denture solution. The solution will weaken tartar compounds. Remember not to do overnight in vinegar with partial dentures unless you get the green light from your dentist. If you do not see tartar buildup on the dentures, stick to an overnight vinegar soak. Some dentists recommend that if you are going to do an overnight soak on a regular basis, only use a solution that is 10% vinegar mixed with water, and only for 8 hours. In most cases, the vinegar won‚Äôt actually dissolve the tartar, but it will soften it so that you can brush it away the next morning.

Broccoli is a nutrient-dense vegetable that is packed with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. It is well-known for being an excellent source of vitamin C and vitamin K, both of which are important for maintaining a healthy immune system and strong bones. Additionally, broccoli contains phytochemicals like sulforaphane, which has been shown to have cancer-fighting properties. Incorporating broccoli into your diet is easy - you can eat it raw as a snack or add it to salads, stir-fries, and soups. Green tea is another food that can offer a host of health benefits. Like broccoli, it is rich in antioxidants that can help protect your body from damage caused by free radicals. Some studies have also found that green tea may help reduce the risk of certain types of cancer, improve brain function, and even aid in weight loss. Drinking two to three cups of green tea per day is a simple way to start reaping these benefits. Finally, probiotics are essential for maintaining a healthy gut microbiome. These beneficial bacteria can improve digestion, boost immunity, and even improve mental health. Foods like yogurt, kefir, and kombucha are all great sources of probiotics that can help keep your gut bacteria in balance. Incorporating these foods into your diet is easy and can offer numerous health benefits. However, it's important to remember that they shouldn't replace medical treatment when it's necessary.

That council also denounced various heresies and schisms, many of which continued to preoccupy his 45yearlong episcopate (c. 8 June 328 ‚Äì 2 May 373). Patriarch Athanasius spent over 17 years in five exiles ordered by four different Roman Emperors, not counting approximately six more incidents in which Athanasius fled Alexandria to escape people seeking to take his life. This gave rise to the expression Athanasius contra mundum or Athanasius against the world. However, during his first years as bishop, Athanasius visited the churches of his territory, which at that time included all of Egypt and Libya. He established contacts with the hermits and monks of the desert, including Pachomius, which proved very valuable to him over the years.

Senators and mayors among those who could have standout performances at conventions. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"As the United States gears up for another presidential election, political analysts and party strategists are focused on the upcoming conventions. With the coronavirus pandemic still raging, the usual pomp and circumstance of large, in-person events is off the table. But even in the era of virtual conventions, the speeches and messaging will be just as important as ever. One of the most famous convention speeches of all time was delivered by then-Senator Barack Obama at the 2004 Democratic convention. Obama's powerful oratory and message of hope resonated with many Americans, and helped launch him onto the national political stage. As the Democrats prepare to nominate their next presidential candidate, they will undoubtedly be looking for someone with Obama's raw political talent and ability to connect with voters. On the other side of the aisle, Republican strategists are hoping to put forward a compelling vision for the future. After four years of the Trump presidency, many Americans are looking for a more positive, uplifting message. GOP leaders will be looking for speakers who can articulate a vision of a brighter future, built on Republican principles like small government, individual freedom, and economic opportunity. Of course, convention speeches are not just about policy positions and slogans. They are also an opportunity to address important themes and issues facing the country. From racial justice and police reform to climate change and immigration, there are a host of urgent issues that will need to be addressed in the coming months. The Democrats are fortunate to have a deep bench of talented politicians who could deliver standout convention speeches. Senators like Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, and Cory Booker are all known for their powerful speaking skills and willingness to take on tough issues. Mayors from across the country, like Atlanta's Keisha Lance Bottoms and Chicago's Lori Lightfoot, could also deliver strong messages that resonate with voters. Ultimately, the success of a convention speech will depend on many factors, including the speaker's delivery, messaging, and timing. But with the stakes so high in this year's election, both parties will be looking for speakers who can rise to the occasion and deliver a message that inspires and energizes voters."},{"prompt":"Aarhus Airport, runwayLength, 2777.0; Aarhus Airport, operatingOrganisation, Aarhus Lufthavn A/S; Aarhus Airport, elevationAboveTheSeaLevel, 25.0; Aarhus Airport, runwayName, 10L/28R What is sentence that verbalizes this data?","completion":"The data provides information about Aarhus Airport, including its runway length of 2777.0, operating organization of \\"Aarhus Lufthavn A/S\\", elevation above sea level of 25.0, and the name of the runway as \\"10L/28R\\"."},{"prompt":"What is a question about this article?

Noether's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry.

Einstein argued that this is true for fundamental reasons, because the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the noncovariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, and others, and has become standard. The use of noncovariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by Erwin Schrodinger and others.

One of the most common mistakes people make is contacting their friends too much. While it‚Äôs important to stay in touch, bombarding someone with messages or phone calls can be overwhelming and uncomfortable. To ensure that you are not overwhelming your friends, it‚Äôs crucial to recognize the signs that you need to back off. These may include delays in responding to your messages, shorter or less enthusiastic responses, or simply a general feeling that the other person is not as invested in the friendship as you are. If you notice any of these signs, it‚Äôs a good idea to give the friendship some space and let it grow naturally. This doesn‚Äôt mean you have to cut off all contact, but rather be more mindful of your communication. If you usually text your friend every day, for example, you might try sending a message every other day instead. If you‚Äôre used to planning outings or activities every weekend, consider scaling it back to once a month. Giving yourself and your friend a little breathing room can actually help strengthen the relationship over time. In many cases, friendships need time to evolve in order to deepen and become more meaningful. By allowing some space and giving your friend the opportunity to come to you, you may find that your relationship becomes stronger and more fulfilling in the long run. Remember, friendship is a two-way street, so it‚Äôs important to respect each other‚Äôs boundaries and be open to growth and change together."},{"prompt":"Jump to the full entry & travel map Grand Blanc , Michigan , United StatesDinner and the hotel in Grand Blanc .

Gather all of your data. Add all the numbers in your sample together. Divide the sum by your sample size (n).","completion":"In data analysis, it is crucial to sort and analyze data accurately, and one of the basic steps is to calculate the mean, which is a measure of central tendency. To calculate the mean, the first step is to gather all the data from the sample. Once you have all of the sample data, add up all the values in the dataset. After obtaining the sum of the data, the next step is to divide the sum by the sample size denoted by n. The resulting value, after carrying out the division, is the mean or average value of the dataset. Calculating the mean can provide essential insights into the dataset, such as identifying the average value of a particular parameter, which is a necessary step for statistical analysis. Additionally, the mean can be used to compare different sets of data to determine which is greater, and it provides valuable information that can be used to make informed decisions. It is worth noting that the mean is a sensitive measure, which means that it can be easily affected by outliers, which are data points that are significantly different from the other values in the dataset. Therefore, it is vital to identify and remove outliers in the dataset to obtain an accurate mean that represents the majority of data values. In conclusion, calculating the mean of a dataset is a fundamental statistical technique that provides valuable information about the central tendency of the data. By following the steps of gathering all data, adding up the values, and dividing by the sample size, analysts can obtain an accurate mean that can be used for statistical analysis and decision-making."},{"prompt":"Generate a tweet that has the following sentiment: negative","completion":"\\"Feeling so frustrated and disappointed right now.

Shaun Edwards says England are using Rugby League tactics. Mike Catt denies it is illegal and says all international teams do it. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"England and Wales are gearing up to face one another as they take to the field at the Millennium Stadium on Friday night. The game promises to be an exciting one for both teams and their fans, but it has been marred by controversy in the lead-up. Shaun Edwards, the Welsh rugby coach, has accused England of using Rugby League tactics. He has implied that these tactics are illegal and unfair, and has suggested that the English team is not playing within the spirit of the game. However, Mike Catt, the England coach, has hit back at these claims, denying that there is anything wrong with the tactics in question. Catt has gone even further, stating that all international teams use similar tactics. So what exactly are these tactics that have caused such a stir in the rugby world? Edwards claims that England are employing a technique known as the 'blocking' or 'shepherding' tactic. This tactic involves using players to block or obstruct the opposition, to create space and allow for successful attacks. Edwards argues that this is against the rules of the game and should not be allowed. Catt, on the other hand, contends that the tactic is perfectly legal and commonly used in international rugby. He suggests that it is a tactic used to create opportunities and is part and parcel of the game. While it is true that many teams use similar tactics, the question remains as to whether or not it crosses the line and becomes illegal. The controversy is sure to rage on until the end of the game and possibly even beyond. Despite the accusations being thrown around, both teams are sure to put in a strong performance on Friday night. This is a match that matters to both England and Wales, and each team will be determined to come away with a win. Fans of both teams will be watching closely, hoping to see their side emerge victorious. In the end, the controversy around the alleged illegal tactics will not overshadow a game that promises to be exciting and competitive. It is up to the referees to decide whether or not England's tactics cross the line, and fans will just have to wait and see. One thing is for sure: this is a match that no rugby fan will want to miss."},{"prompt":"f I'll take responsibility for my oversight., can we conclude that I'll take responsibility of my mistake. ?

The original motivation for group theory was the quest for solutions of polynomial equations of degree higher than 4. The 19thcentury French mathematician √âvariste Galois, extending prior work of Paolo Ruffini and JosephLouis Lagrange, gave a criterion for the solvability of a particular polynomial equation in terms of the symmetry group of its roots (solutions). The elements of such a Galois group correspond to certain permutations of the roots. At first, Galois' ideas were rejected by his contemporaries, and published only posthumously.

But the question remains, which of the two happened later? The Battle of Marciano was fought on August 2, 1554, in Tuscany, Italy. It was a battle between the troops of the Republic of Siena and the soldiers of the Florentine-Imperial army. The latter was commanded by Giovanni dalle Bande Nere, an Italian condottiero. The battle ended in a decisive victory for the Florentine-Imperial army, which signaled the end of the Republic of Siena and its annexation into the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. On the other hand, the Treaty of Chambord was signed on January 15, 1552, in France. The treaty ended the First Habsburg-Valois War, a conflict between the Holy Roman Empire and France for control of Italy. The treaty was signed by Henry II of France and Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. It recognized the Habsburgs' control over the Italian territories of Naples, Milan, and Genoa, while France retained control over the Duchy of Savoy. Therefore, based on the timeline, the Treaty of Chambord happened earlier than the Battle of Marciano. The Treaty of Chambord was signed in 1552, while the Battle of Marciano took place in 1554. The resolution of the First Habsburg-Valois War through the Treaty of Chambord set the stage for the Battle of Marciano, which was fought as part of the conflict between the Republic of Siena and the Florentine-Imperial army. In conclusion, the Treaty of Chambord occurred earlier than the Battle of Marciano. Both events are significant in European Renaissance history, as they illustrate the ongoing power struggles between different factions and nations vying for control of Italy during this period."},{"prompt":"Down out and on heroin in Malm Please fix the punctuation.","completion":"Down, out, and on heroin in Malm√∂."},{"prompt":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: The Sandlot is a 1993 American comingofage baseball film cowritten and directed by David M.

Think about when you rub your hands together. It is friction that makes them warm. But why does this happen? Friction causes the molecules on rubbing surfaces to move faster. Faster moving particles have more heat energy. Heat from friction can be useful. Can you think of other places where you might find friction? Friction also lets you light a match. Heat from friction can also cause problems. It can cause a car to overheat. To reduce friction, oil is added to the engine. Oil coats the surfaces of moving parts. This coating of oil makes them slippery. When things are slippery there is less friction. Have you ever seen a sign that says, slippery when wet? This too has to do with friction.

Hundredth anniversary Derby coming up next weekend.","completion":"Researcher Maureen Howes has come forward to challenge the common belief that suffragette Emily Davison was a \\"suicidal fanatic\\". Instead, Howes suggests that after trawling through old mementoes, Davison's death at the Epsom Derby in 1913 was a tragic accident. Many have criticized Davison for her actions on that fateful day, where she ran onto the racetrack and was hit by the King's horse. However, Howes argues that Davison was not attempting to take her own life, but rather was attempting to hang a suffragette banner on the horse's reins as a form of protest. With the hundredth anniversary of the Derby approaching next weekend, it's important to re-examine our assumptions about Emily Davison's actions and motivations. Howes' research sheds new light on this tragic event and helps us to understand the complex and often dangerous world of suffragette activism. As we reflect on Emily Davison's legacy, let us remember her as a brave and committed advocate for women's rights, rather than as a suicidal fanatic. Let us honor her memory by continuing to fight for gender equality in all areas of society."},{"prompt":"elect a different editor for editing tasks.

Western staff notation is used by composers to prescribe to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines and/or chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This leaves less room for practices such as improvisation and ad libitum ornamentation, which are frequently heard in nonEuropean art music and in popular music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles lend themselves to the song form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can attain a high level of complexity.

In order to find out how many more households than families were in the county in 2000, we need to calculate the difference between their numbers. According to the US Census Bureau, a family is defined as a group of two or more people who reside together and who are related by birth, marriage, or adoption. In contrast, a household is defined as a person or a group of people who reside in the same housing unit, regardless of their relationship with one another. In 2000, the total number of households in the county was 100,000. Meanwhile, the total number of families was 80,000. To find out how many more households than families there were in the county in 2000, we simply subtract the number of families from the number of households: 100,000 - 80,000 = 20,000 Therefore, there were 20,000 more households than families in the county in 2000. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as an increase in the number of individuals living alone, or the presence of non-family groups residing in the same housing units. Nonetheless, it is important to note that both households and families are crucial units of analysis in understanding population trends and living arrangements, and that their differences and similarities are important considerations for policymakers, researchers, and social scientists alike."},{"prompt":"Add punctuation: Recovery software mac for digital storage media recovers accidentally deleted pictures audio video songs clipping photographs snapshots office files and important documents from all types of USB digital media Mac file restore program for removable device easily searches and recovers all lost data using inbuilt advanced disk scanning mechanismData rescue for Mac can recover deleted file from Mac external hard disk flash drives mp3mp4 players portable media players flash memory devices and other mass storage device","completion":"Recovery software for Mac, for digital storage media, recovers accidentally deleted pictures, audio, video songs, clipping photographs, snapshots, office files, and important documents from all types of USB digital media.

This Golden Harvet production was helmed by veteran director Robert Clouse. Sadly he was either lucky with Enter the Dragon or he's lost his touch because he's not that great of a director. The only reason to watch this movie is to see the fighting skills of Ms. Rothrock and Richard Norton. If this movie was directed by Corey Yuen or Hoi Meng it could have been an action classic instead of a cheesy straighttovideo action flick. China O'Brien returns home to help out her dad. He's having trouble with the local mob and he needs her help. So she returns home and restores order (with the help of two unlikely people). But will they be enough to topple Mister Big and his evil cronies? If you're a big Cynthia Rothrock fan then this movie's catered for you. I only enjoyed the fighting scenes, everything else is rubbish. Why didn't Raymond Chow shell out a few shekels and hired a top notch action director? Recommended.

The glaciers in Glacier National Park have receded and are predicted to melt away completely in a few decades. Many Montana cities set heat records during July 2007, the hottest month ever recorded in Montana. Winters are warmer, too, and have fewer cold spells.
