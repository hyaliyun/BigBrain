Such burrowing discourages barnacles from clinging to their shells. When fully grown, however, the crabs can readily withstand tidal currents without burrowing, and thus they acquire substantial populations of barnacles. Surprisingly, in areas where tidal currents are very weak, juvenile horseshoe crabs are found not to have significant barnacle populations, even though they seldom burrow. Which of the following, if true, most helps to explain the surprising finding? A: Until they are fully grown, horseshoe crabs shed their shells and grow new ones several times a year. B: The strength of the tidal currents in a given location varies widely over the course of a day.

Recent advances in cataract surgery illustrate why this is occurring. Cataracts are a major cause of blindness, especially in elderly people. Ten years ago, cataract surgery was painful and not always effective. Thanks to the new technology used in cataract surgery, the operation now restores vision dramatically and is less expensive. These two factors have caused the number of cataract operations performed to increase greatly, which has, in turn, driven up the total amount spent on cataract surgery. Which one of the following can be inferred from the passage? A: Ten years ago, cataract surgery was affordable for more people than it was last year. B: The total amount spent on cataract surgery has increased because the increased number of people electing to have the surgery more than offsets the decrease in cost per operation.

These facts provide conclusive evidence that Professor Smythe was appointed to undermine the department. The reasoning in the argument is flawed because the argument A: bases a general claim on a few exceptional instances B: overlooks the fact that something can have the reputation for being of poor quality without being of poor quality C: fails to distinguish between a decline in quantity and a decline in quality D: assumes that because an action was followed by a change, the action was undertaken to bring about that change Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"D"},{"prompt":"Throughout a certain nation, electricity has actually become increasingly available to people in urban areas while energy production has been subsidized to help residents of rural areas gain access to electricity. However, even with the subsidy, many of the most isolated rural populations still have no access to electricity. Thus, the energy subsidy has failed to achieve its intended purpose. The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument A: fails to take into account that the subsidy could have helped many of the rural residents in the nation gain access to electricity even if many other rural residents in the nation were not helped in this way B: presumes, without providing justification, that the intended purpose of the subsidy was to benefit not only rural populations in the nation who have no electricity, but other people in the nation as well C: overlooks the possibility that even many of the people in the nation who live in urban areas would have difficulty gaining access to electricity without the subsidy D: takes for granted that if a subsidy has any benefit for those whom it was not intended to benefit, then that subsidy has failed to achieve its intended purpose Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"A"},{"prompt":"Spring Mountain College recently sent out a survey to the graduating class of 2003 asking that the graduates provide their class rank.

One must ttherefore either abandon the opinion of this majority of commentators or reject Mather' s definition of Baroque painting, which says that for any painting to be considered Baroque, it must display opulence, heroic sweep, and extravagance. The conclusion of the argument can be properly drawn if which one of the following is assumed? A: Opulence, heroic sweep, and extravagance are not present in Caravaggio's paintings. B: A painter who makes use of the interplay of light and shadow need not for that reason be considered a nonrealistic painter. C: A realistic painting usually does not depict the world as opulent, heroic, or extravagant. D: Realism was not widely used by painters prior to the seventeenth century.

A: Since it is Sawyer who is negotiating for the city government, it must be true that the city takes the matter seriously. After all, if Sawyer had not been available, the city would have insisted that the negotiations be deferred. B: Clearly, no candidate is better qualified for the job than Trumbull. In fact, even to suggest that there might be a more highly qualified candidate seems absurd to those who have seen Trumbull at work.

Some of these theorists have even produced interesting arguments to support that position. One writer, for example, contends that anarchy is laissezfaire capitalism taken to its logical extreme. But these theorists' views ignore the fundamental principle of social philosophy that an acceptable social philosophy must promote peace and order. Any social philosophy that countenances chaos, i. e. , anarchy, accordingly deserves no further attention. The reasoning in Bowers's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that A: the argument fails to show that laissezfaire capitalism deserves to be rejected as a social philosophy B: the truth or falsity of a view is not determined by the number of people who accept it as true C: the meaning of a key term shifts illicitly during the course of the argument D: it is unreasonable to reject a view merely because it can be described as extreme Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"C"},{"prompt":"Editorialist: The positions advanced by radical environmentalists often contain hypotheses that are false and proposals that are economically infeasible.

A: Recipients of longterm training are much less likely than recipients of shortterm training to have recurrences of problematic levels of anxiety. B: A decrease in symptoms of anxiety often occurs even with no treatment or intervention by a mental health professional. C: Shortterm relaxation training conducted by a more experienced practitioner can be more expensive than longterm training conducted by a less experienced practitioner.

The studies may also be taken as showing, ttherefore, that there is no increased health risk associated with eating fruits and vegetables containing pesticide residues. The pattern of flawed reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to the pattern of flawed reasoning in the argument above? A: Research shows that there is no greater longterm health benefit associated with taking vitamin supplements than with a moderate increase in the intake of fruits and vegetables. Clearly, then, there is no longterm health risk associated with the failure to take vitamin supplements, so long as enough fruits and vegetables are consumed. B: Research has shown that there is no longterm health risk associated with a diet consisting largely of foods high in saturated fat and cholesterol if such a diet is consumed by someone with a physically active lifestyle. So, exercise is a more useful strategy for achieving cardiological health than is dietary restriction. C: Research has shown that young people who drive motorcycles and receive one full year of extensive driving instruction are in fact less likely to become involved in accidents than those who simply pass a driving test and drive cars. This shows that there is not an inherently greater risk associated with driving a motorcycle than with driving a car. D: Research shows that the incidence of certain major illnesses, including heart disease and cancer, is decreased in communities that have a modern power plant. The fact that this tendency is present whether the power plant is nuclear or not shows that there is no increased health risk associated with living next to a nuclear power plant.

However, since many patients stop taking those drugs within three days, reinfection is common in cases where those drugs are prescribed. A new antibiotic requires only a threeday course of treatment. Ttherefore, reinfection will probably be less common in cases where the new antibiotic is prescribed than in cases where either penicillin or erythromycin is prescribed. Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument? A: Regardless of whether they take a traditional antibiotic or the new one, most patients feel fully recovered after taking the drug for three days. B: Some of the people who are allergic to penicillin are likely to be allergic to the new antibiotic.

The police officer's argument proceeds by A: proposing an alternative method for drivers to discuss their plans and ask directions B: producing a counterexample to a general assertion C: appealing to the police officer's training on highway safety to discredit a commonly held view D: pointing out a dissimilarity between drivers who talk on cell phones while driving and drivers in Denton Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"B"},{"prompt":"The axis of Earth' s daily rotation is tilted with respect to the plane of its orbit at an angle of roughly 23 degrees. That angle can be kept fairly stable only by the gravitational influence of Earth' s large, nearby Moon. Without such a stable and moderate axis tilt, a planet' s climate is too extreme and unstable to support life. Mars, for example, has only very small moons, tilts at wildly fluctuating angles, and cannot support life. If the statements above are true, which one of the following must also be true on the basis of them? A: Gravitational influences other than moons have little or no effect on the magnitude of the tilt angle of either Earth's or Mars's axis. B: If Earth's Moon were to leave Earth's orbit, Earth's climate would be unable to support life. C: No planet that has more than one moon can support life. D: Any planet with a stable, moderate axis tilt can support life.

The group using miteproof bedding had a 69 percent reduction in the dustmite allergen in their mattresses, whereas there was no significant reduction in the control group. However, even though bedding is the main source of exposure to dust mites, no symptom reduction was reported in either group. Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent conflict in the statements above? A: The medical community does not fully understand how dustmite allergens cause allergy. B: Dustmite allergens in bedding tend to irritate many allergy sufferers' nasal passages more than do the same allergens in other locations, such as carpets. C: When people report their own allergy symptoms, they tend to exaggerate the severity of those symptoms.

However, two years ago there was an average of 640 such visits per representative, whereas last year that figure fell to 501. So the additional promotion must have been counterproductive, making physicians less willing to receive visits by pharmaceutical sales representatives. Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the argument? A: Most pharmaceutical companies did not increase the amount of money they spend promoting drugs through advertising targeted directly at consumers. B: Most pharmaceutical manufacturers increased the size of their sales forces so that their sales representatives could devote more time to each physician. C: The more visits a physician receives from a pharmaceutical sales representative, the more likely he or she is to prescribe drugs made by that representative's company.

Natural selection should ttherefore favor extreme longevitybut this does not seem to be the case. A possible explanation is that aging is a product of the inevitable wear and tear of living, similar to how household appliances generally accumulate faults that lead to their eventual demise. However, most researchers do not find this analogy satisfactory as an explanation. Which of the following would, if true, provide the strongest explanation for the researchers' reaction? A: Organisms are capable of maintenance and selfrepair and can remedy much of the damage that they accumulate. B: Some organisms are capable of living much longer than other organisms.

Which one of the following arguments most closely conforms to the principle underlying the reasoning in the spokesperson's argument? A: I object to the policy of making parents responsible for the offenses of their older adolescent children. After all, these adolescents have minds of their own and freely choose to act as they do, often in ways that do not reflect the wishes of their parents. B: The students are justified in their objection to the reading assignment. Many of the topics concern material that is not covered in class, and students should not be required to do such reading in order to do well in the course. C: A recent survey revealed that over twothirds of the teachers in the district are permitted to teach classes on subjects in which they have received no formal training. Thus parents of students in the district should check the qualifications of their children's teachers.

Soon, other macaques began to enter the spring, and over a few years this behavior was adopted by the entire troop. Prior to 1963, no macaques had ever been observed in the hot spring; by 1990, the troop was regularly spending time there during the winters. Thus, these macaques are able to adopt and pass on new patterns of social behavior, and are not complete captives of their genetic heritage. Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument above? A: The social behaviors of macaques are completely independent of their genetic heritage. B: New patterns of behavior that emerge in macaque populations over the course of a few years or decades are not necessarily genetically predetermined.

Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the reasoning above? A: The funding initially earmarked for a government project is always subject to change, given the mechanisms by which the political process operates. B: For the past two decades, most alternative energy initiatives have received little or no government funding. C: All large corporations have made it a point to discourage some forms of research.

Cora: To ask this question, you must be making a mistaken assumption: that typing speed was to be maximized. The real danger with early typewriters was that operators would hit successive keys too quickly, thereby crashing typebars into each other, bending connecting wires, and so on. So the idea was to slow the operator down by making the most common letter sequences awkward to type. Bernard: This is surely not right! These technological limitations have long since vanished, yet the keyboard is still as it was then. Which one of the following, if true, could be used by Cora to counter Bernard's rejection of her explanation? A: Typewriters and wordprocessing equipment are typically sold to people who have learned to use the standard keyboard and who, ttherefore, demand it in equipment they buy. B: The standard keyboard allows skilled operators to achieve considerable typing speeds, though it makes acquiring such skills relatively difficult. C: A person who has learned one keyboard layout can readily learn to use a second one in place of the first, but only with difficulty learn to use a second one alongside the first.

Interestingly, biologists have observed that all of the offspring of this insect that are hatched from eggs are females, and all of the offspring that are liveborn are males. It has also been noted that any particular liveborn brood will comprise fewer individuals than any particular brood hatched from eggs. However, a much larger proportion of male offspring than of female offspring survives to adulthood, and among thrips reaching adulthood the ratio of males to females is about even. Which one of the following can be properly inferred about the species of thrips described in the passage? A: Any female of the species that can reproduce by laying eggs can also reproduce by bearing live young but not necessarily vice versa. B: There are females that use only one of the two methods of reproduction over the course of their lives. C: On average, across the species, more of the offspring are born by hatching from eggs than are born live.

A sophisticated statistical analysis looked at the number of athletes who suffered an ACL injury, and assigned numerical values to both the nature of the stress that produced the injury and to the resultant level of damage to the ACL. Researchers expected that, controlling for level of injurycausing stress, all athletically inclined individuals would show similar tendency toward ACL injury regardless of the specific sport. A surprising outcome is that, equalizing for injuringcausing stress, it appears that gymnasts have a much higher tendency toward ACL injury than do members of the National Football League (NFL), but this is most likely because __ Which of the following most logically completes the argument? A: gymnasts are often given credit for inventing new positions or moves, while football players far more regularly follow the typical moves associated with their position. B: high school and college football players who have a higher tendency to ACL injury are far less likely to advance to the NFL. C: gymnasts are in general far more flexible than football players.

As a result, spending on consumer goods declines, leading in turn to more lost jobs and a worsening of the economy. Eventually, the economy becomes so bad that prices collapse; the lower prices encourage people to increase spending on consumer goods, and this higher spending results in economic improvement. Terry: People cannot increase their spending if they have no jobs and no money for anything other than basic necessities, so price collapses cannot lead to economic improvement. Which one of the following, if true, most undermines Terry's objection to Robin's analysis? A: Even people who do not lose their jobs spend less in bad economic times and thus have savings available to spend when prices collapse. B: People who have lost their jobs must continue to buy some basic goods such as food, even during bad economic times.

Because all species of pit vipers are predators, scientists have long thought that these sensors were used to find prey. One researcher has hypothesized, however, that the infrared sensor serves primarily to assist the viper in judging the size of approaching predators and how far away they are. Which one of the following, if true, would most support the researcher's hypothesis? A: Pit vipers have a welldeveloped sense of smell that they use to supplement the thermal impressions they receive from their infrared sensors. B: Pit vipers do not differ in their predatory behavior from closely related vipers without pits, but they do differ markedly from these other species in their strategies of defense against predators. C: The rattle of the diamondback rattlesnake, one of the most common kinds of pit viper, functions as a defense mechanism to intimidate predators. D: Pit vipers are distinguishable from other viper species not only by their pits but also by the chemical composition of their venom.

Clearly, ttherefore, to increase profits we must sign up new tenants. Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument? A: The mall is located in a geographic area in which costs incurred for airconditioning in the hot summers exceed those incurred for heating in the mid winters by a wide margin. B: The mall's occupancy rate, though relatively low, has been relatively stable for several years. C: The mall's operating costs could be cut by consolidating currently rented spaces in such a way that an entire wing of the mall could be closed up.

But in an unrestricted free market, such as the market these athletes compete in, salaries are determined by what someone else is willing to pay for their services. These athletes make enormous profits for their teams' owners, and that is why owners are willing to pay them extraordinary salaries. Thus the salaries they receive are fair. Vanwilligan's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed? A: If a professional athlete's salary is fair, then that salary is determined by what an individual is willing to pay for the athlete's services in an unrestricted free market. B: The fairest economic system for a society is one in which the values of most goods and services are determined by the unrestricted free market. C: If professional athletes were paid less for their services, then the teams for which they play would not make as much money.

Wildlife parks that rely on the killer whales for entertainment hunt the killer whale almost exclusively in the water of Iceland, because strict sanctions forbid them from doing so off the coast of North America, an area also abundant in killer whales. Since Iceland recently gave into pressure from international groups opposed to the hunting of killer whales, it too will forbid the hunting of killer whales off its coast. Ttherefore, all wildlife parks will be forced to end their shows featuring killer whales once their current killer whales are unable to perform. All of the following cast doubt on the conclusion of the argument EXCEPT? A: The recent ban only extends to within one hundred miles of Iceland, though killer whales are plentiful along the shores of Greenland, which fall outside this range. B: Inpark killer whale births have become increasingly common, especially in those wildlife parks that harbor a large number of killer whales. C: The incoming prime minister of Canada, who is more conservative, is planning on lifting the ban on hunting killer whales off the coast of Canada.

Many scholars, however, doubt the attribution of the Testament to Thorpe because, whereas the Examination is dated 1406, the Testament is dated 1460. One scholar has recently argued that the 1460 date be amended to 1409, based on the observation that when these numbers are expressed as Roman numerals, MCCCCLX and MCCCCIX, it becomes easy to see how the dates might have become confused through scribal error. Which of the following, if true, would most support the scholar's hypothesis concerning the date of the Testament? A: In the preface to the 1530 publication, the editor attributes both works to William Thorpe. B: The Testament contains few references to historical events that occurred later than 1406.

Although the sample was not large enough to determine its flying habits at such a young age, scientists guessed that the threedayold bird would have been able to fly from birth and might have been hunting at the time the tree sap fell onto the bird, preserving it for millions of years. This proves how different this species of birds is from modern birds; modern birds depend on their parents for care for 2 to 3 weeks, while this ancient specimen was able to hunt right out of the nest. The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument A: does not consider the possibility that immediate flight was a risk to the species. B: draws its conclusion from data that cannot be proven true. C: confuses the cause of death with the effects of death. D: takes an inconsistent stance regarding its premise and conclusion.

However, the majority of accidents that happen at excessive speeds do not result in fatalities. Ttherefore, there is no need to enact laws that address car accidents at excessive speeds as being distinct from other kinds of car accidents. The pattern of flawed reasoning displayed in the argument above most closely resembles that in which one of the following? A: Foods rich in cholesterol and fat pose a serious health threat to most people. However, many people are reluctant to give up eating foods that they greatly enjoy. Ttherefore, people who refuse to give up rich foods need to spend more time exercising than do other people. B: Most physicians recommend a balanced diet for those who want to remain in good health. Yet many people find that nontraditional dietary regimens such as fad diets do their health no serious harm. Ttherefore, there is no need for everyone to avoid nontraditional dietary regimens. C: Many serious health problems are the result of dietary disorders. Yet these disorders are often brought about by psychological factors. Hence people suffering from serious health problems should undergo psychological evaluation. D: Overweight people are at a higher risk of developing heart disease than other people. However, more than half of all overweight people never develop heart disease. Hence it is unnecessary for physicians to be more careful to emphasize the danger of heart disease to their overweight patients than to their other patients.

Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the professor's argument? A: The protection against loss that insurance provides is more important to one's wellbeing than is the possibility of a windfall gain. B: Individuals spend, on average, much more on insurance than on lottery tickets. C: Taking small financial risks can often greatly increase one's chances of obtaining much larger benefits.

Since the trumpeter was definitely Louis Armstrong, somehow the announcer must have gotten the date of the recording wrong. The pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following arguments? A: This painting titled La Toilette is Berthe Morisot's La Toilette only if a painting can be in two museums at the same time. Since nothing can be in two places at once, this painting must some how have been mistitled. B: Only if a twentiethcentury Mexican artist painted in Japan during the seventeenth century can this work both be by Frida Kahlo as labeled and the seventeenthcentury Japanese landscape it appears to be. Since it is what it appears to be, the label is wrong. C: Unless Kathe Kollwitz was both a sculptor and a printmaker, the volunteer museum guide is wrong in his attribution of this sculpture. Since what Kollwitz is known for is her prints, the guide must be wrong. D: If this painting is a portrait done in acrylic, it cannot be by Elisabeth VigeeLebrun, since acrylic paint was developed only after her death. Thus, since it is definitely a portrait, the paint must not be acrylic.

Clearly, contemporary societies should fulfill their obligation as stewards of cultural heritage without the assistance of aristocracies or religious institutions, so governments must help finance the maintenance, advancement, and enrichment of the fine arts today. The curator's argument depends on assuming which one of the following? A: In contemporary societies, aristocracies and religious institutions are not willing to help finance the fine arts. B: Maintenance, advancement, and enrichment of the fine arts in any era require governmental subsidies. C: If contemporary governments help to maintain and enrich the fine arts, private support for the arts will become unnecessary.

Thus, used cars that are less than ten years old are generally easier to sell than are cars that are ten years old or older. Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends? A: The salability of something is not influenced by any factors other than the level of demand for it. B: All used cars that are ten years old or older are sold to junkyards. C: When determining the selling price of cars less than ten years old, the lack of demand would not be offset by a lack of supply.

These leases were supposed to have included a provision that reinstates the royalties should the market prices of oil and gas exceed a certain level. Because of an error by the federal government, however, the language that reinstates the royalties is missing from the more than 1, 100 leases issued by the U. S. government in 1998 and 1999. Since the market price of oil and gas has recently risen far above the threshold levels, this error could allow the oil companies to reap a windfall of more than 10 billion through the life of the leases. In response, the government is pressuring the oil companies to renegotiate the leases. The executives of the oil companies strongly oppose renegotiation; all have issued statements stating that they expect the government to honor the terms of the contracts and that renegotiating a duly signed agreement would set a bad precedent.

Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the argument? A: Allowing for inflation, average individual income has significantly declined over the last 25 years. B: There has been a significant increase over the last 25 years in the proportion of individuals in households with more than one wage earner. C: During the last 25 years, annual newcar sales and the population have both increased, but newcar sales have increased by a greater percentage.

This indicates that citizens are becoming increasingly disconnected from the political system with each passing generation. The argument's reasoning is questionable in that the argument A: overlooks the possibility that voting patterns among age groups will change in the future B: compares an early stage of one generation to a later stage of another C: fails to take into account the relative sizes of the generations compared D: confuses the cause of an effect with the effect itself Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"B"},{"prompt":"A park' s user fees are employed to maintain the park. When fewer people use the park, it suffers less wear. Thus raising user fees improves park maintenance even if the number of people who stop using the park because of higher fees is great enough to reduce the revenues devoted to maintenance. Which one of the following conforms most closely to the principle illustrated by the statements above? A: By spending more on zoo maintenance, a city increases the number of zoo patrons. The extra revenue generated by the sale of memorabilia more than makes up for the extra costs of maintenance. B: Road taxes are raised to encourage more people to use mass transit. But since the fee paid by each commuter does not equal the cost of providing transit for that commuter, a mass transit service will deteriorate even as it takes in more money. C: To increase its market share, a car company improves the service warranty it provides to those who purchase a new car. Making good on the warranties proves expensive enough that the company's profits decrease even though its market share increases. D: Library fees have been increased to raise money for book repair. Since the library now has fewer patrons, the books are in better repair even though the number of library patrons has decreased to such an extent that the money available for book repair has decreased. Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"D"},{"prompt":"Alan: Government subsidies have been proposed in Cariana to encourage farmers in Rochelle, the country' s principal agricultural region, to implement certain new farming techniques. Unless these techniques are implemented, erosion of productive topsoil cannot be controlled. Unfortunately, farmers cannot afford to shoulder the entire cost of the new techniques, which are more expensive than those currently used. Ttherefore, without subsidies, agricultural output in Rochelle will inevitably decline. Betty: But erosion in Rochelle is caused by recurring floods, which will end next year once Cariana completes the hydroelectric dam it is building across the region' s major river. Ttherefore, Rochelle' s total agricultural output will stabilize at its present level even without subsidies. Which one of the following is an assumption on which Betty's argument depends? A: Building a dam across Rochelle's major river will not reduce any recurrent flooding that occurs in regions of Cariana other than Rochelle. B: The cost to the government of Cariana to operate the hydroelectric dam will not be greater than the projected cost of subsidizing the farmers of Rochelle in the implementation of the new farming techniques. C: The current yearly output, if any, from Rochelle's land that will be permanently under water once the dam is completed will at least be matched by additional yearly output from Rochelle's remaining land. D: The government of Cariana has sufficient financial resources both to subsidize its farmers' implementation of new farming techniques and to operate a hydroelectric dam.

But these predictions are baseless. Throughout recorded history, dramatists have relied on ghosts and spirits to enliven their stories, and yet the scientific understanding of the populace has steadily advanced. The television network executive's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds? A: It fails to consider that one phenomenon can steadily advance even when it is being impeded by another phenomenon. B: It fails to consider that the occurrence of one phenomenon can indirectly affect the pervasiveness of another even if the former does not impede the latter. C: It fails to consider that just because one phenomenon is known to affect another, the latter does not also affect the former.

Since there were many other cars around me that were going as fast as I was, the police officer clearly treated me unfairly. Mary: You were not treated unfairly, since the police officer was obviously unable to stop all the drivers who were speeding. Everyone who was speeding at that time and place had an equal chance of being stopped. Which one of the following principles, if established, would most help to justify Mary's position? A: If all of those who violate a traffic law on a particular occasion are equally likely to be penalized for violating it, then the law is fairly applied to whoever among them is then penalized. B: Fairness in the application of a traffic law is ensured not by all violators' having an equal chance of being penalized for their violation of the law, but rather by penalizing all known violators to the same extent. C: It is fairer not to enforce a traffic law at all than it is to enforce it in some, but not all, of the cases to which it applies. D: The penalties attached to traffic laws should be imposed on all people who violate those laws, and only those people. Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"A"},{"prompt":"Bank depositors in the United States are all financially protected against bank failure because the government insures all individuals' bank deposits. An economist argues that this insurance is partly responsible for the high rate of bank failures, since it removes from depositors any financial incentive to find out whether the bank that holds their money is secure against failure. If depositors were more selective. then banks would need to be secure in order to compete for depositors' money. Which of he following, if true, most seriously weakens the economist s argument? A: When the government did not insure deposits frequent bank failures occurred as a result of depositors' fears of losing money in bank failures. B: There is an upper limit on the amount of an individual's deposit that the government will insure. but very few individuals' deposits exceed this limit. C: Before the government started to insure depositors against bank failure, there was a lower rate of bank failure than there is now. D: Surveys show that a significant proportion of depositors are aware that their deposits are insured by the government.

Mice infected with the herpesvirus generally develop keratitis, a degenerative disease affecting part of the eye. Since proteins on the surface of cells in this part of the eye closely resemble those on the herpesvirus surface, scientists hypothesize that these cases of keratitis are caused by antibodies to the herpesvirus. Which of the following, if true, most helps to support the scientists' reasoning? A: Mice that are infected with the herpesvirus but do not develop keratitis produce as many antibodies as infected mice that do develop keratitis B: There are mice that are unable to form antibodies in response to herpes infections, and these mice contract herpes at roughly the same rate as other mice C: Other types of virus have surface proteins that closely resemble proteins found in various organs of mice.

The conclusion above is properly drawn if which one of the following is assumed? A: The only Australian placentals that could be native to Australia would be animals whose ancestors could not have reached Australia from elsewhere. B: Some marsupials now found in Australia might not be native to that continent, but rather might have been introduced to Australia by some other means.

So if a survey is well constructed, survey respondents' desire to meet surveyors' expectations has no effect on the survey' s results. The reasoning in the researcher's argument is questionable in that the argument overlooks the possibility that A: an opinion survey that disguises the surveyor's expectations may be flawed in a number of ways, some of which have nothing to do with the surveyor's expectations B: some people who know what answers an opinion surveyor expects to hear will purposefully try to thwart the surveyor's expectations C: many opinion surveyors have no expectations whatsoever regarding the answers of people who respond to surveys D: the answers of opinionsurvey respondents can be influenced by beliefs about the surveyor's expectations even if those beliefs are unfounded Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"D"},{"prompt":"John: In 80 percent of car accidents, the driver at fault was within five miles of home, so people evidently drive less safely near home than they do on long trips.

Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument? A: The reporter who writes a story is usually better placed than the reporter's editor is to judge what 'the story's most newsworthy features are.

Personal income tax rates are progressive (i. e. , graduated), and if total revenue remains constant, then acrosstheboard cuts in these taxes require increasing the amount of revenue generated through nonprogressive taxes, thereby favoring the wealthy. Yet if nonprogressive taxes are not increased to compensate for the cuts, then the budget deficit will increase, requiring more government borrowing and driving up interest rates. This favors those who have money to lend, once again benefiting primarily the wealthy. Which one of the following statements most accurately expresses the main conclusion of the economist's argument? A: It is the wealthy who are favored by generating a high amount of revenue through nonprogressive taxes. B: Acrosstheboard personal income tax rate cuts generally benefit the wealthy more than they benefit others. C: Acrosstheboard cuts in personal income tax rates do not generate enough additional economic activity to prevent a net loss of revenue.

The intent is to attract more workers and shoppers to downtown businesses by making downtown easier to reach and more pleasant to move around in. Which of the following would, if true, most strongly support the prediction that the plan would achieve its goal? A: Most people who prefer to shop at suburban malls instead of downtown urban areas do so because parking is easier and cheaper at the former.

Two possible explanations for this increase have been offered. First, the recording of deaths due to asthma has become more widespread and accurate in the past decade than it had been previously. Second, there has been an increase in urban pollution. However, since the rate of deaths due to asthma has increased dramatically even in cities with longstanding, comprehensive medical records and with little or no urban pollution, one must instead conclude that the cause of increased deaths is the use of bronchial inhalers by asthma sufferers to relieve their symptoms. Each of the following, if true, provides support to the argument EXCEPT: A: By temporarily relieving the symptoms of asthma, inhalers encourage sufferers to avoid more beneficial measures. B: Evidence suggests that bronchial inhalers make the lungs more sensitive to irritation by airborne pollen. C: Ten years ago bronchial inhalers were not available as an asthma treatment.

But since pity can be felt only when there is someone or something to be pitied, and since nothing but the music is available to be the object of the listener' s pity, if anything is pitiable, then it is the music itself. But it makes no sense to say that a piece of music is pitiable; so music cannot arouse pity in the listener. The pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following arguments? A: Some people claim that the quality of one's life can be estimated by summing all the positive aspects of one's life and subtracting all the negative aspects. This implies that it is possible to place a numerical value on such things as health and emotional wellbeing; but trying to put a numerical value on such things is nonsense. Thus, the quality of a life cannot be measured in this way. B: Some statisticians predict future events by observing past events; this requires extrapolating from the past. Though it is impossible to make completely accurate predictions through extrapolation, many predictions can be made with at least a reasonable degree of confidence. Ttherefore, these statisticians are justified in making predictions about the future. C: Some science writers imagine what life would be like if humans could inhabit distant planets. Inhabiting these planets, they claim, is an inevitable consequence of current research. But it is absurd to think that humans will actually live on other planets. Ttherefore, it must be wrong to claim that this follows inevitably from current research. D: Astronomers use color photography to measure the temperatures of stars. Using color photography implies that the object photographed has color. But it makes no sense to speak of the color of stars because stars are clouds of gas. Ttherefore, color photographs of stars must represent something other than the color of the stars.

The reasoning in the argument above is flawed in that the argument A: takes for granted that a threat that is aggravated by certain factors could not occur in the absence of those factors B: takes for granted that because one event precedes another the former must be the cause of the latter C: ignores the possibility that a certain type of outcome is dependent on more than one factor D: presumes, without providing justification, that a certain outcome would be desirable Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"C"},{"prompt":"Science journalist: Europa, a moon of Jupiter, is covered with ice. Data recently transmitted by a spacecraft strongly suggest that there are oceans of liquid water deep under the ice. Life as we know it could evolve only in the presence of liquid water. Hence, it is likely that at least primitive life has evolved on Europa. The science journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it A: fails to address adequately the possibility that there are conditions necessary for the evolution of life in addition to the presence of liquid water B: takes for granted that no conditions on Europa other than the supposed presence of liquid water could have accounted for the data transmitted by the spacecraft C: takes for granted that if a condition would be necessary for the evolution of life as we know it, then such life could not have evolved anywhere that this condition does not hold D: takes for granted that life is likely to be present on Europa if, but only if, life evolved on Europa Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"A"},{"prompt":"A nationwide poll of students, parents, and teachers showed that over 90 percent believe that an appropriate percentage of their school' s budget is being spent on student counseling programs. It seems, then, that any significant increase in a school' s budget should be spent on something other than student counseling programs. Which one of the following describes a flaw in the reasoning of the argument above? A: The argument fails to justify its presumption that what is true of a part of the budget is also true of the total budget. B: The argument confuses a mere coincidence with a causal relationship. C: The argument confuses the percentage of the budget spent on a program with the overall amount spent on that program.

Currently, natural gas costs twice as much in Chester as it does in Tilsen. If the cost of natural gas in Chester becomes more than twice that in Tilsen, ChesChem will move its manufacturing operations to Tilsen. So if the cost of natural gas in Chester increases at all, ChesChem will move its manufacturing operations to Tilsen. The economist's argument requires assuming that A: the only benefit ChesChem would receive by moving its manufacturing operations to Tilsen is lower energy costs B: ChesChem spends far more on natural gas than on any other expense C: the price of natural gas in Tilsen will not increase D: ChesChem would not be profitable if its energy costs increased Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"C"},{"prompt":"The everyday behavior of whales is particularly difficult to study because introducing novel stimuli, such as divers or submarines, into the whales' environment causes whales to behave in unusual ways. Some biologists plan to train sea lions to carry video cameras on their backs and, on command, to swim along with whales. They argue that since whales are accustomed to there being sea lions nearby, using the sea lions to film the whales would allow biologists to study the everyday behavior of the whales. Which one of the following is an assumption on which the biologists' reasoning depends? A: The trained sea lions will not be aware that they are carrying video cameras on their backs. B: Whales will often react aggressively in the presence of divers and submarines although aggressive behavior is unusual for whales. C: The behavior of the sea lions under human command will be within the range of sea lion behavior to which the whales are accustomed.

The conclusion in the passage depends on the assumption that A: writing speeding tickets should be as important a priority for the city as combating drugrelated crime B: drugrelated crime is not as serious a problem for the city as the police chief claims it is C: the police cannot continue writing as many speeding tickets as ever while diverting resources to combating drugrelated crime D: every member of the police force is qualified to work on combating the city's drug problem Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"C"},{"prompt":"Outbreaks of Rift Valley fever occur irregularly in East Africa, several years apart. When outbreaks do occur, they kill thousands of cattle. A livestock vaccine against the disease exists but is rarely used. It is too expensive for farmers to use routinely, and since it is not effective until a month after vaccination, administering it after an outbreak begins helps very little. Nevertheless, experts predict that use of the vaccine will increase significantly within the next few years. Which of the following, if true, provides the strongest justification for the experts' prediction? A: When an outbreak of Rift Valley fever occurs, unaffected countries often refuse to import livestock from the countries affected by the outbreak. B: Recently published research has shown that certain identifiable climatic conditions are almost invariably followed, within two to five months, by an outbreak of Rift Valley fever. C: Rift Valley fever is spread by mosquitoes, but each outbreak is so widespread that it is impractical to control it by using insecticides. D: It would take less than a month for producers of the vaccine to adjust their production operations to cope with a large increase in demand.

The argument by the citizens' group relies on which one of the following assumptions? A: Plainsville's economy will not be helped unless a new business park of the sort envisioned by the citizens' group is built. B: The mayor is required to get approval for all tax revenue allocation plans from the city council. C: Plainsville presently has no major highways running through it.

A: In the middle of the nineteenth century, the population of North America was significantly smaller than it is today. B: The proportion of people who die in their seventies is significantly smaller today than is the proportion of people who die in their eighties. C: Most of the gains in life expectancy in the last 150 years have come from reductions in the number of infants who die in their first year of life.

A: Carbon dioxide will dissolve much more thoroughly if it is pumped into cold water than it will if it is pumped into warmer water. B: Carbon dioxide dissolved in cool, dense water in ocean depths will not escape back into Earth's atmosphere a long time before the water in which that carbon dioxide is dissolved mixes with warmer water near the surface.

That is, as long as all of their needs were met, they would continue dividing forever. However, it has been shown that normal cells have a finite reproductive limit. A human liver cell, for example, divides 60 times and then stops. If such a cell divides 30 times and then is put into a deep freeze for months or even years, it remembers where it stopped dividing. After thawing, it divides another 30 times but no more.

The flower of a recently discovered orchid species contains edible tendrils that invariably attract insects to the inside of the flower. Hence, it follows that this orchid species is one that is pollinated solely by insects. The argument is flawed because it A: assumes without warrant that a characteristic that distinguishes one class of things from another is the only characteristic that distinguishes that class from the other B: mistakes a characteristic that is unique to one particular class of things for a characteristic that is unique to an unrelated class of things C: treats a characteristic known to be true of one class of things as if that characteristic were unique to that class D: makes broad generalizations about all members of a particular class of things on the basis of what is known about a member of an unrelated class of things Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"C"},{"prompt":"Television news coverage gives viewers a sense of direct involvement with current events but does not provide the depth of coverage needed for the significance of those events to be appreciated. Newspapers, on the other hand, provide depth of coverage but no sense of direct involvement. Unfortunately, a full understanding of current events requires both an appreciation of their significance and a sense of direct involvement with them. Ttherefore, since few people seek out news sources other than newspapers and television, few people ever fully understand current events. The reasoning in the argument is flawed because the argument A: treats two things, neither one of which can plausibly be seen as excluding the other, as though they were mutually exclusive B: makes crucial use of the term depth of coverage without defining it C: fails to consider the possible disadvantages of having a sense of direct involvement with tragic or violent events D: ignores the possibility that people read newspapers or watch television for reasons other than gaining a full understanding of current events Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"A"},{"prompt":"Although the code of the NutriFare Grocery Store states that the company must employ some workers with disabilities, no blind or deaf employees have yet been hired for employment by the grocery store.

The pattern of reasoning displayed above is most closely paralleled in which one of the following? A: Since African violets do not thrive in direct sunlight, it is said that in this region these plants should be placed in windows facing north rather than south; however, since these southfacing windows are well shaded by evergreen trees, the African violets placed in them are likely to grow satisfactorily. B: House plants generally grow best in pots slightly larger than their existing root systems, so the usual advice is to repot when roots first reach the sides of the pot; this rule should not be followed with amaryllis plants, however, because they are likely to do best with tightly compressed roots. C: Where flowers are to be planted under shade trees, gardening experts often advise using impatiens since impatiens does well in conditions of shade; however, it is unlikely to do well under maple trees since maple tree roots are so near the surface that they absorb all available moisture.

One suggestion is that coral reefs are colorful and, ttherefore, that colorful fish are camouflaged by them. Many animal species, after all, use camouflage to avoid predators. However, as regards the populations around reefs, this suggestion is mistaken. A reef stripped of its fish is quite monochromatic. Most corals, it turns out, are relatively dull browns and greens. Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main conclusion drawn in the marine biologist's argument? A: The fact that many species use camouflage to avoid predators is one reason to believe that brightly colored fish living near reefs do too. B: It turns out that the corals in a coral reef are mostly dull hues of brown and green. C: A reef stripped of its fish is relatively monochromatic. D: The suggestion that the fish living around coral reefs exhibit bright colors because they are camouflaged by the reefs is mistaken.

Which one of the following, if true, is the logically strongest counter that Albert can make to Erin's argument? A: PAHs are one of several components of automobile exhaust that scientists suspect of causing cancer. B: It is not known whether PAHs are a causal factor in any diseases other than heart and lung disease and cancer.

Admittedly, if most of the assets were owned by quite affluent households, and most of the debt was owed by lowincome households, high household debt levels could have been the cause of the recession despite high asset values: lowincome households might have decreased spending in order to pay off debts while the quite affluent ones might simply have failed to increase spending. But, in fact, quite affluent people must have owed most of the household debt, since money is not lent to those without assets. Ttherefore, the real cause must lie elsewhere. The argument is structured to lead to which one of the following conclusions? A: When people borrowed money prior to the recent recession, they did not use it to purchase assets. B: High levels of household debt did not cause the recent recession. C: Lowincome households succeeded in paying off their debts despite the recent recession.

Moral responsibility for an action depends solely on the intentions underlying the action and not on the action' s results. Ttherefore, legal responsibility, depending as it does in at least some cases on factors other than the agent' s intentions, is different than moral responsibility. The claim that the penalties for drunk driving are far more severe when the drunk driver accidentally injures people than when no one is injured plays which one of the following roles in the ethicist's argument? A: It is a premise offered in support of the claim that moral responsibility depends solely on the intentions underlying the action and not on the action's result. B: It is a premise offered in support of the claim that legal responsibility for an action is based solely upon features of the action that are generally unintended by the agent. C: It is a premise offered in support of the claim that legal responsibility depends in at least some cases on factors other than the agent's intentions.

In European rock layers, the fossil record of the boundary layer that marks the end of the period supports this picture of rapid, mass extinction of life. But the boundary layer in the Antarctic is much thicker, so that it appears that the extinction process there lasted a much longer time, contrary to what the hypothesis would have predicted. Which one of the following, if true, resolves the apparent discrepancy noted above? A: It was recently discovered that Europe accumulated sediment at a slower rate than did the Antarctic region, so that a layer of sediment of a given thickness represents a longer period of time in Europe than it does in the Antarctic. B: Although scientists have traditionally used the last appearance of creatures called ammonites to define the boundary layer, they recently found ammonites 20 meters above the previously identified boundary layer in the Antarctic.

Ttherefore, because Ashley collects only tanzanite stones, she is unlikely ever to collect a stone not originally from Tanzania. Which one of the following is most similar in its reasoning to the argument above? A: Frogs are the only animals known to live in the lagoon on Scrag Island. The diet of the owls on Scrag Island consists of nothing but frogs from the island. Ttherefore, the owls are unlikely ever to eat an animal that lives outside the lagoon. B: Every frog ever seen on Scrag Island lives in the lagoon. The frogs on the island are eaten only by the owls on the island, and hence the owls may never eat an animal that lives outside the lagoon. C: The lagoon on Scrag Island is home to many frogs. Since the owls on Scrag Island eat nothing but frogs from the island, the owls will probably never eat many frogs that live outside the lagoon. D: The only frogs yet discovered on Scrag Island live in the lagoon.

The bird stopped chewing furniture, but it is now afraid of hands and will sometimes bite. Since chewing on the furniture would not have hurt the bird, George should not have hit it. When Carla' s puppy escaped from her yard, it bounded into a busy street. Although Carla does not generally approve of physical discipline, she hit the puppy sharply with her hand.

But this catastrophe was probably not responsible for most of these extinctions. Any major asteroid strike kills many organisms in or near the region of the impact, but there is little evidence that such a strike could have a worldwide effect. Indeed, some craters even larger than the Chicxulub crater were made during times in Earth' s history when there were no known extinctions. Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the argument? A: There is no evidence that any other asteroid of equal size struck Earth at the same time as the asteroid that produced the Chicxulub crater. B: During the period immediately before the asteroid that produced the Chicxulub crater struck, most of the world's dinosaurs lived in or near the region of the asteroid's impending impact. C: Fossils have been discovered of a number of dinosaurs that clearly died as a result of the asteroid impact that produced the Chicxulub crater.

Which one of the following is an assumption required by the editorial's argument? A: The threat of harsh punishment deters people from committing transgressions only if this threat is at least sometimes carried out. B: Everyone has at least some tendency to feel guilt or shame for committing extremely severe transgressions.

Because the parasite cannot travel to a new generation of red blood cells, any fever that develops in a person more than 120 days after that person has moved to a malariafree region is not due to the malarial parasite. Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the conclusion above? A: The fever caused by the malarial parasite may resemble the fever caused by flu viruses. B: Many malarial symptoms other than the fever, which can be suppressed with antimalarial medication, can reappear within 120 days after the medication is discontinued. C: The anopheles mosquito, which is the principal insect carrier of the malarial parasite, has been eradicated in many parts of the world.

The device alerts the DC10, via a red light, when another plane is slightly more than three minutes away from a potential collision. The red light comes on and stays on until the approaching plane is safely out of range. Aviation experts at Miro Jet Inc. have determined that three minutes is ample time for a plane to divert its respective flight path to avoid a collision. Ttherefore, if the red light on the anticollision device is off, the DC10 is more than three minutes flying time from any plane. Which of the following, if true, most fundamentally calls into question the aviation analyst's argument? A: Recently, a near collision in which both planes were less than 90 seconds flying distance from each other was averted only by the prompt actions of air traffic controllers.

The transportation commissioner concluded that the traffic prevents the buses from reaching their stops on time, despite the existence of a number of busonly lanes throughout the city. He has ttherefore proposed creating additional busonly lanes on city streets to allow more buses to bypass traffic. The success of the commissioner's proposal depends on which of the following assumptions? A: Automobile drivers will not object to the proposal. B: The city's busonly lanes do not contribute substantially to gridlock by reducing the number of lanes available to other traffic. C: The city owns enough buses to cover all established routes.

But this course has no more mathematics in it than high school algebra does. The fact that a course has mathematics in it does not mean that it needs to be taught by a mathematics professor, any more than a course approaching its subject from a historical perspective must be taught by a history professor. Such demands by the mathematics department are ttherefore unjustified. The dean's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it A: presumes, without providing justification, that any policies that apply to history courses must be justified with respect to mathematics courses B: purports to refute a view by showing that one possible reason for that view is insufficient C: presumes, without providing justification, that expertise in a subject does not enable one to teach that subject well D: presumes, without providing justification, that most students are as knowledgeable about mathematics as they are about history Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"B"},{"prompt":"A recent poll of a large number of households found that 47 percent of those with a cat had at least one person with a university degree, while 38 percent of households with a dog had at least one person with a university degree. Clearly, people who hold university degrees are more likely to live in a household with a cat than one with a dog. The reasoning in the argument is flawed in that the argument A: fails to consider how many of the households have at least one person without a university degree B: ignores the possibility that a significant number of households might have both a cat and a dog C: takes for granted that there are not significantly more households with a dog than ones with a cat D: ignores the possibility that two things can be correlated without being causally connected Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"C"},{"prompt":"Parent P: Children will need computer skills to deal with tomorrow' s world. Computers should be introduced in kindergarten, and computer languages should be required in high school. Parent Q: That would be pointless.

Which one of the following, if true, is the strongest logical counter parent P can make to parent Q's objection? A: In the process of learning to work with any computer or computer language, children increase their ability to interact with computer technology. B: Automotive technology is continually advancing too, but that does not result in one's having to relearn to drive cars as the new advances are incorporated into new automobiles. C: Throughout history people have adapted to change, and there is no reason to believe that today's children are not equally capable of adapting to technology as it advances.

A: The crime rate will increase if the economy does not improve or if we do not increase the number of police officers. But we will be able to hire more police officers if the economy does improve. Ttherefore, the crime rate will not increase. B: If global warming continues or if the rate of ozone depletion is not reduced, there will be an increase in the incidence of skin cancer. But reduced use of aerosols ensures both that global warming will not continue and that ozone depletion will be reduced. Thus, the incidence of skin cancer will not increase. C: If deforestation continues at the current rate and the use of chemicals is not curtailed, wildlife species will continue to become extinct. But because of increasing population worldwide, it is inevitable that the current rate of deforestation will continue and that the use of chemicals will not be curtailed.

Market analysts predict that the decision of these three manufacturers, who control 80 percent of the laundry detergent market, will eventually bring about the virtual disappearance of oldstyle bulky detergents. Which one of the following, if true, most strongly supports the prediction made by the market analysts? A: Most smaller manufacturers of laundry detergents will consider it too expensive to retool factories for the production of the smaller detergent packages. B: Some analysts believe that consumers will have to pay a greater cost per load of laundry to use the new concentrated detergent than they did to use the oldstyle detergent. C: Consumers are increasingly being persuaded by environmental concerns to buy concentrated detergents when available in order to reduce cardboard waste. D: Major supermarkets have announced that they will not charge the detergent manufacturers less to display their detergents, even though the detergents will take up less shelf space.

Frank's argument is an attempt to counter Lance's conclusion by A: demonstrating that Lance assumes the very thing he sets out to prove B: establishing that experience teaches us the opposite of what Lance concludes C: showing that Lance's conclusion involves him in a contradiction D: showing that it has no implications for any real cases Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"C"},{"prompt":"The Volunteers for Literacy Program would benefit if Dolores takes Victor' s place as director, since Dolores is far more skillful than Victor is at securing the kind of financial support the program needs and Dolores does not have Victor' s propensity for alienating the program' s most dedicated volunteers. The pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most closely paralleled in which one of the following? A: Joshua's interest would be better served by taking the bus to get to his parent's house rather than by taking an airplane, since his primary concern is to travel as cheaply as possible and taking the bus is less expensive than going by airplane. B: It would be to Fred's advantage to exchange his bus tickets for train tickets, since he needs to arrive at his meeting before any of the other participants and if he goes by bus at least one of the other participants will arrive first. C: It would be more convenient for Dominique to take a bus to school than to take the subway, since the bus stops closer to her house than does the subway and, unlike the subway, the bus goes directly to the school. D: Anita would benefit financially by taking the train to work rather than driving her car, since when she drives she has to pay parking fees and the daily fee for parking a car is higher than a roundtrip train ticket.

Because retrospective studies of human subjects must use the subjects' reports about their own pasts, however, such studies cannot reliably determine the causes of human subjects' present characteristics. Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the argument's conclusion to be properly drawn? A: A retrospective study cannot reliably determine the causes of human subjects' present characteristics unless there exist correlations between the present characteristics of the subjects and what happened to those subjects in the past. B: In studies of human subjects that attempt to find connections between subjects' present characteristics and what happened to those subjects in the past, the subjects' reports about their own pasts are highly susceptible to inaccuracy. C: Every scientific study in which researchers look for significant connections between the present characteristics of subjects and what happened to those subjects in the past must use the subjects' reports about their own pasts.

Each ring represents one year, and the ring' s thickness reveals the relative amount of rainfall that year. Archaeologists successfully used annual rings to determine the relative ages of ancient tombs at Pazyryk. Each tomb was constructed from freshly cut logs, and the tombs' builders were constrained by tradition to use only logs from trees growing in the sacred Pazyryk Valley. Which one of the following, if true, contributes most to an explanation of the archaeologists' success in using annual rings to establish the relative ages of the tombs at the Pazyryk site? A: The Pazyryk Valley, surrounded by extremely high mountains, has a distinctive yearly pattern of rainfall, and so trees growing in the Pazyryk Valley have annual rings that are quite distinct from trees growing in nearby valleys. B: The archaeologists determined that the youngest tree used in any of the tombs was 90 years old and that the oldest tree was 450 years old. C: Each log in the Pazyryk tombs has among its rings a distinctive sequence of twelve annual rings representing six drought years followed by three rainy years and three more drought years.

The results of one extensive study in which smoke samples taken from forest fires were bottled and then analyzed in a research laboratory supports this hypothesis, since the analysis showed that all of the samples contained high concentrations of nitrous oxide. Which one of the following, if true, most undermines the argument? A: The production of synthetic products such as nylon is responsible for up to 10 percent of the nitrous oxide present in the atmosphere. B: Soil bacteria that feed on ammonium compounds present in organic ash are thought by some scientists to excrete small amounts of nitrous oxide that then enter the atmosphere. C: By using gasanalyzing devices mounted on helicopters, researchers can perform onsite analyses of smoke instead of sending smoke samples to laboratories for analysis. D: When in a closed container, the gases in smoke produced by forest fires quickly react with each other thereby producing high concentrations of nitrous oxide.

The process leaves no radiation behind, and vitamin losses are comparable to those that occur in cooking, so there is no reason to reject irradiation on the grounds of nutrition or safety. Indeed, it kills harmful Salmonella bacteria, which in contaminated poultry have caused serious illness to consumers. Opponent: The irradiation process has no effect on the bacteria that cause botulism, a very serious form of food poisoning, while those that cause bad odors that would warn consumers of botulism are killed. Moreover, Salmonella and the bacteria that cause botulism can easily be killed in poultry by using a safe chemical dip. The opponent's argument proceeds by A: showing that claims made in the proponent's argument result in a selfcontradiction B: shifting perspective from safety with respect to consumers to safety with respect to producers C: establishing that undesirable consequences result from the adoption of either one of two proposed remedies D: pointing out an alternative way of obtaining an advantage claimed by the proponent without risking a particular disadvantage Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"D"},{"prompt":"Situation: In the island nation of Bezun, the government taxes gasoline heavily in order to induce people not to drive.

Despite this lack of longterm effect, doctors often recommend vitamin E for patients about to undergo heart surgery. Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the doctors' recommendation? A: Many patients who are told that they are being given vitamin E actually receive a medically inert substance. B: Postoperative complications occur six or more hours after surgery for some patients who have not been given vitamin E.

The Duke, then, was right about at least one thing: Concern for the welfare of the people is necessary for the successful governance of Acredia. The reasoning in the commentator's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument A: infers that a certain condition is required for success from the fact that the lack of that condition is associated with failure B: ignores the possibility that the conditions that are necessary for the welfare of the people are likely to change over time C: appeals to evidence from sources that are likely to be in some way biased or unreliable D: infers the necessity of a certain condition for success from the fact that its absence has always led to failure Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"A"},{"prompt":"Lydia: Red squirrels are known to make holes in the bark of sugar maple trees and to consume the trees' sap.

Yet nineteenth century French painting showed a remarkable degree of innovation. Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the difference between the amount of innovation in French painting and the amount of innovation in French sculpture during the nineteenth century? A: Because stone was so much more expensive than paint and canvas, far more unsponsored paintings were produced than were unsponsored sculptures in France during the nineteenth century. B: The French academy in the nineteenth century financially supported a greater number of sculptors than painters, but individual painters received more support, on average, than individual sculptors. C: Very few of the artists in France in the nineteenth century who produced sculptures also produced paintings.

But when people fail to live up to the very ideals they hold in highest esteem, exaggeration of such failings often forms the basis of successful comedy. Thus the current popularity of comedians who display disrespect in their acts is hardly surprising. The critic's argument depends on which one of the following assumptions? A: People who enjoy comedians who display disrespect in their acts do not place a high value on respect for others. B: People who value an ideal especially highly do not always succeed in living up to this ideal. C: Many people disapprove of the portrayal of blatant disrespect for others in comedy acts.

The biologist's view, if true, provides the most support for which one of the following? A: Contrary to what some believe, large goats achieve greater reproductive success than small goats even when space is limited. B: The evolutionary pressure to ensure a diverse gene pool does not have the effect of increasing the frequency of a gene for small size.

The shrimp get this pigment from tiny red algae that they filter through their leg bristles. In the Jurassic period (about 200 million years ago), both algae and shrimp were an excellent source of food for any larger animal equipped to sieve them out of the water through an anatomical strainer. The Argentine pterodactyl possessed a row of thin, bristlelike teeth through which it pumped water, straining out any tiny food particles in the process. Thus, because it was able to filter both algae and shrimp, it is reasonable to conclude that the pterodactyl acquired a pink coloration. Which one of the following statements, if true, strengthens the argument for the existence of a pink pterodactyl? A: The Argentine pterodactyl's habitat included shallow seas that were particularly rich in red algae and shrimp. B: If the Argentine pterodactyl did not eat a diet containing red algae, its color was determined by factors other than diet. C: The Argentine pterodactyl inhabited the shores of shallow freshwater seas in Jurassic South America.

Which one of the following, if true, most helps to account for the pest control experts' recommendation? A: Bug zappers use more electricity but provide less light than do most standard outdoor light sources. B: Insecteating birds will take up residence in any insectrich area if they are provided with nesting boxes, food, and water.

If the ethicist's statements are true, then each of the following could be true EXCEPT: A: If someone wants to have compassion toward others but does not, that person is worthy of praise. B: Someone who acts without feelings of compassion toward those affected by the actions is worthy of praise if those actions enhance the welfare of the people affected.

Stagehands like it because changing sets every night means more overtime and, thus, higher pay. Theater managers like it because, if plays that reflect audience demand are chosen for production, most performances generate large revenues. It is evident, ttherefore, that more theaters should change to repertory. The argument above would be strengthened if which one of the following were true? A: In a repertory theater, storage space for sets for more than one production must be available. B: In a repertory theater, a large capital outlay is required at the beginning of each season. C: In a repertory theater, plays can be rescheduled to meet audience demand.

So these newly discovered fossils show, contrary to the account espoused by most paleontologists, that no bird descended from any dinosaur. The reasoning in the argument is flawed in that the argument A: draws a generalization that is broader than is warranted by the findings cited B: ignores the possibility that dinosaurs and birds descended from a common ancestor C: fails to consider the possibility that dinosaurs descended from birds D: attacks the adherents of the opposing view personally instead of addressing any reason for their view Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"A"},{"prompt":"An art critic, by ridiculing an artwork, can undermine the pleasure one takes in it; conversely, by lavishing praise upon an artwork, an art critic can render the experience of viewing the artwork more pleasurable. So an artwork' s artistic merit can depend not only on the person who creates it but also on those who critically evaluate it. The conclusion can be properly drawn if which one of the following is assumed? A: Most people seek out critical reviews of particular artworks before viewing those works. B: Most people lack the confidence necessary for making their own evaluations of art. C: The merit of an artistic work is determined by the amount of pleasure it elicits. D: The pleasure people take in something is typically influenced by what they think others feel about it.

The only place where the wild form of emmer wheat has been found growing is a relatively narrow strip of southwest Asia. Since the oldest remains of cultivated emmer wheat yet found are from village sites in the same narrow strip, it is clear that emmer wheat was first domesticated somewhere in that strip. Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument? A: It is very difficult, without genetic testing, to differentiate the wild form of emmer wheat from a closely related wild wheat that also grows in southwest Asia. B: Modern experiments show that wild emmer wheat can easily be domesticated so as to yield nearly as well as traditionally domestic strains. C: In the region containing the strip where wild emmer wheat has been found, climatic conditions have changed very little since before the development of agriculture. D: The presentday distribution of another wild wheat, einkorn, which was also domesticated early in the development of agriculture, covers a much larger area of southwest Asia.

Preserving old buildings creates an impediment to new development, which is critical to economic health. The flawed reasoning exhibited by the argument above is most similar to that exhibited by which one of the following arguments? A: You should have your hair cut no more than once a month. After all, beauticians suggest that their customers have their hair cut twice a month, and they do this as a way of generating more business for themselves. B: One should not borrow even small amounts of money unless it is absolutely necessary. Once one borrows a few dollars, the interest starts to accumulate. The longer one takes to repay, the more one ends up owing, and eventually a small debt has become a large one. C: The committee should endorse the plan to postpone construction of the new expressway. Many residents of the neighborhoods that would be affected are fervently opposed to that construction, and the committee is obligated to avoid alienating those residents.

As can be seen, however, from their response to last year' s cut, it will not put them out of existence. Last year there was also an 8 percent cut, and though private fundraising was very difficult for the arts groups in the current recessionary economy, they did survive. The reasoning in the argument is flawed because the argument A: overlooks the possibility that the cumulative effect of the cuts will be more than the arts groups can withstand B: equates the mere survival of the arts groups with their flourishing C: relies without warrant on the probability that the economy will improve D: does not take into account that the dollar amount of the proposed cut is lower than the dollar amount of last year's cut Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"A"},{"prompt":"Suncorp, a new corporation with limited funds, has been clearing large sections of the tropical Amazon forest for cattle ranching.

Sphenodontidans were plentiful throughout the world during the age of the dinosaurs. But the survival of sphenodontidans near New Zealand, and their total disappearance elsewhere, is no mystery. New Zealand and nearby islands have no native land mammals. Land mammals, plentiful elsewhere, undoubtedly became major predators of sphenodontidans and their eggs, leading to their extinction. Dr. Santos: In fact, the tuatara thrive only on a few islands near New Zealand. On all those where land mammals, such as rats, dogs, or cats, have been introduced in recent years, the tuatara are now extinct or nearly so.

Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument? A: Symptoms of colic generally disappear as infants grow older, whether the infants have been fed breast milk exclusively or have been fed infant formula containing cow's milk. B: When mothers of infants that are fed only breast milk eliminate cow's milk and all products made from cow's milk from their own diets, any colic symptoms that their infants have manifested quickly disappear. C: Infants that are fed breast milk develop mature digestive systems at an earlier age than do those that are fed infant formulas, and infants with mature digestive systems are better able to tolerate certain proteins and antibodies found in cow's milk. D: A study involving 500 sets of twins has found that if one infant has colic, its twin will probably also have colic.

The Irish potato famine of the 1840s is an exception; it resulted in the death or emigration of half of Ireland' s population, but there was no significant rise in the average wages in Ireland in the following decade. Which one of the following, if true, would LEAST contribute to an explanation of the exception to the generalization? A: The birth rate increased during the decade following the famine, and this compensated for much of the loss of population that was due to the famine. B: Eviction policies of the landowners in Ireland were designed to force emigration of the elderly and infirm, who could not work, and to retain a high percentage of ablebodied workers. C: Improved medical care reduced the mortality rate among ablebodied adults in the decade following the famine to below prefamine levels.
