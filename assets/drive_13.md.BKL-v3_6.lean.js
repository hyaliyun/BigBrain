Here are 10 things I wish I knew before going to Exeter: 1. Getting in is the easy part Many students can attest that the application process was no joke. Once I got in, it was a relief. I got cocky, and told myself — I'm good enough to get into Exeter, nothing can stop me now! Then reality hit once I entered the classroom and realized I wasn't all that I was cracked up to be. The admissions process is difficult for a reason. So, if you're in the middle of writing applications, imagine a school year filled with this level of workload (but also lots of fun and new experiences). And if you've gotten in or have just started, buckle up! 2. It won't be like Zoey 101 I watched [LINKED_TEXT: Zoey 101] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoey_101] growing up, and when I thought of boarding school, I thought it would involve strolling between classes in the California sunshine, with views of the ocean and surfers, or sleepovers with your best friends every night. But, Exeter is nothing like that. We’d have to wade through feet of snow during blizzards and risk getting swept away in 30mph winds during hurricanes to get to class. And the teenage drama only lasted first-year; instead, my experience became dominated by late-night cramming and existential crises. 3. You won't be the smartest person in the room I was in for a shock when I realized that everyone seated across the Harkness table was just as smart, but more often, way smarter, than me. Before, I immediately knew the answer to a question or what to say in class. Now, I’d have to go to my classmates for help. The tables had turned. 4. Time will fly by — don't put things off!! Stepping foot on campus with four years ahead of you seems like you'll have all the time in the world to tick everything off your bucket list. But it'll really fly by. I used my course load or short-term commitments as an excuse for not improving myself in the long-term. I put off putting an actual effort into improving my grades, saying, oh next term things will be different — until it was too late. 5. Enter the shallow end first Browse the course catalog, and you'll find classes like Molecular Biology, or Accelerated Chemistry (Introductory and AP Chemistry in one year), or Quantum Mechanics. Seems cool. But ease into the course load, and don't set yourself up to fail. Think of the academic experience as a marathon, and not a sprint. Going in as a freshman taking the most fancy-sounding, difficult classes will burn you out, kill your self-esteem, and make it harder to do well in the terms to come. 6. Prepare for B’s and C’s As many of you can relate, A’s can come easily in middle school. In fact, I went into a panic in 6th grade when I got an 88 on a Sewing Project in Home Ed and thought it was the end of the world. But at Exeter, the standards are much higher. The new teaching style or demand of the curriculum can make you struggle in your best subjects. Or new classes may be much harder than anticipated. So, Bs and Cs are pretty normal, and colleges knew about the rigor of Exeter academics when they review your transcript. 7. Get ready to write At Exeter, humanities courses like English and History are graded strictly on writing and discussion. Almost every week will involve a minimum of one essay, if not more. You'll exhaust personal stories to write in narratives, and learn the art of cranking out 500 words in the free block before class. 8. Keep it close to home Call home. You may think you're way too busy, or that your parents are too lame to ring up every night. Or that you'll seem lame for doing so. But give them a call, even if it's for a minute to check-in. And, stay in touch with your friends at home. At Exeter, it may be easy to lose touch with them, with your new friends and new experiences that they can't relate to. But once you graduate and are spending summers or breaks at home, you'll realize how much you value those long-term friendships. 9. It won't be a straight road to Harvard I discuss this in more depth [LINKED_TEXT: here] [URL: https://www.quora.com/Does-going-to-a-school-like-Exeter-or-Andover-really-increases-my-chance-of-getting-into-an-Ivy-League/answer/Harshita-Yerramreddy?ch=10&share=73f805a8&srid=ztJ7] and [LINKED_TEXT: here] [URL: https://www.quora.com/Does-what-high-school-you-attend-affect-what-colleges-you-get-accepted-to/answer/Harshita-Yerramreddy?ch=10&share=eda73961&srid=ztJ7], so take a look at that! Essentially, it’s a very common myth that going to Exeter is a straight road to Ivy League schools, and it’s, if anything, the opposite. 10. You can't peak in high school Everyone will tell you — after Exeter, everything else will be so easy. So naturally, you'd think, great, I can coast from here — my life will be easy. But just think about that — do you really want to peak in high school? Casey Neistat introduced something a few years ago called the [LINKED_TEXT: Tarzan Principle] [URL: https://youtu.be/7HF4peQxeXA?t=387], which essentially states that life should be perceived as if you’re Tarzan, swinging across vines. You can’t hold onto just one vine once you feel ‘successful,’ because then you’ll stagnate and can’t reach the next. Likewise, boarding school should just be one of those vines to get you to that next peak, not something to hold onto."},{"prompt":"Alexandria OcasioCortez said Going by track record, I’d feel safer in a bathroom with a trans woman than a powerful male executive any day of the week. What do you think about this?","completion":"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said \\"Going by track record, I’d feel safer in a bathroom with a trans woman than a powerful male executive any day of the week.\\" What do you think about this? She’s referring to the fact that, to date, there is not a single documented case of a trans woman raping or sexually assaulting a cis woman in the toilet. Not. A. Single. One. There are however many, many documented examples of “powerful male executives” raping and/or sexually assaulting women, as anyone who watches the news could tell you. Based on that track record, it seems perfectly logical to me that a woman would be more nervous of being alone with a “powerful male executive” than of being alone with a trans woman. But of course the objections to trans women using the women’s ‘bathroom’ aren’t based on logic, so how much difference her observation will make is debatable.

WE ARE A NATION OF LAWS IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO OBEY THE LAWS YOU DO NOT BELONG HERE."},{"prompt":"What are some tips for me if I am new to competitive programming?","completion":"If you're a student of computer science or a coding enthusiast, there's a good possibility that you've overheard others talking about their competitive programming abilities, as well as their placements and accomplishments in various code challenges or competitions. It's true that having a competitive programming talent will help you stand out from the crowd, make your resume look better, and give you an advantage over other candidates when applying for jobs or other employment prospects. You should be aware that many well-known tech corporations, such as Facebook, Google, Amazon, and others, give candidates' competitive programming talents a lot of weight and sometimes even hire them after finding them through various competitive programming competitions. There are websites who provide courses in order to help students learn skills like DSA to improve their competitive programming, few such websites include Logicmojo, Udemy, Coding Ninjas etc. Competitive Programming Competitive programming is a practice that involves addressing a variety of real-world programming issues while adhering to strict time, memory, time & space complexity, and other constraints. The goal is to improve your programming and data structures & algorithms skills. You must use your choice programming language to create an optimal solution to the provided programming problem within the allotted time frame, and your code must pass all necessary test cases. The best part is that you get to compete against a variety of bright minds from around the globe and develop not only your programming or DSA skills but also other abilities like logical and analytical thinking, problem-solving, time management, breaking a problem down into manageable pieces, and many other abilities. Learn Data Structures & Algorithms The core aspect of Competitive Programming i.e., Data Structures & Algorithms. Indeed, learning the DSA fundamentals is a must to start your journey of becoming a Competitive Programmer. What you need to know is that while some people will tell you that learning DSA is not required in order to get started with CP and can be done along the way, we strongly advise that you at least brush up on the basics of DSA, such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, searching, sorting, time and space complexity, etc., before beginning to solve problems and participate in competitive problems. This will give you the confidence you need to solve the majority of the problems. You won't be able to come up with an optimized, effective, and perfect solution for the given programming challenge if you don't have a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms. To learn and master DSA, I will strongly recommend you Logicmojo live course on data structure and algorithms as there you’ll find adequate quality resources such as live classes from expert faculties, regular assignments and test after completion of topics, Logicmojo is the most affordable online course, including mentorship and mock interview guidance also, and much more. Start Practicing and Solving Problems SPOJ: It’s a problem Archive (recommended for all beginners) Start with problems having maximum submissions. Solve the first few problems (may be 20). Build some confidence. Then start following some good coders (check their initial submissions). Then start solving problems topic wise. Never get stuck for too long in the initial period. Google out your doubts and try to sort them out or you can discuss with someone (ONLY IN THE BEGINNING). Before getting into live contests like Codeforces or Codechef, make sure that you have solved about 50-70 problems on SPOJ. CODECHEF: Do all the three contests every month. Do participate in CodeChef LunchTime for sure. Even if you are unable to solve a problem, do always look at the editorials and then code it and get it accepted (this is the way you will learn). And even if you are able to do it, do look at the codes of some good coders. See how they have implemented it. Again, you will learn. Same point applies to TopCoder and Codeforces as well. Codeforces: 4 to 5 short contests of 2 hours in a month (Do them once you develop some confidence). TopCoder: Once you have proper experience and you can write codes very fast. Online Programming Contests You write codes and submit them online. The judge runs your code and checks the output of your program for several inputs and gives the result based on your program’s outputs. You must follow exact I/O formats. For example, do not print statements like: “please enter a number”, etc. Each problem has constraints: Properly analyze the constraints before you start coding.Time Limit in seconds (gives you an insight of what is the order of solution it expects) -> order analysis (discussed later).The constraints on input (very imp): Most of the time you can correctly guess the order of the solution by analyzing the input constraints and time limit.Memory Limit (You need not bother unless you are using an insanely large amount of memory). Types of errors you may encounter apart from wrong answer: Run Time Error (Most Encountered) Segmentation fault (accessing an illegal memory address)You declared an array of smaller size than required or you are trying to access negative indices.Declaration of an array of HUGE (more than 10^8 ints) size.Dividing by Zero / Taking modulo with zero.USE gdb (will learn in coming lectures) Compilation error You need to learn how to code in C++.USE GNU G++ compiler or IDEONE(be careful to make codes private). Time Limit Exceeded Your program failed to generate all output within a given time limit.Input Files are not randomly generated , they are made such that wrong code does not pass.Always think of the worst cases before you start coding .Always try to avoid TLE.Sometimes a little optimizations are required and sometimes you really need a totally new and efficient algorithm (this you will learn with time).So whenever you are in doubt that your code will pass or not .Most of the time it won’t pass .Again do proper order analysis of your solution . Wrong Answer [most encountered] Wrong answer means that the output given by your program did not match the correct output for that input (or did not fulfill the conditions in case multiple solutions were possible). This is the most frequently occurring bug that you will face and getting rid of it can be a pain.First of all, you must check that your program gives correct output for the sample test cases, exactly satisfying the output format.Read your code completely once before testing. This way you will be able to remove any obvious bugs.Check for incorrect variable initializations / uncleared memory, etc. These errors can also occur when you copy paste code.In case you keep getting wrong answers even after you have tried to find the bug in your program you must rethink your algorithms and prove it if you haven’t done so. If you find a bug in your algorithm, start working on a new algorithm. Conclusion Finally, I will say that you must learn the basic and well-known algorithms first, and for that I would recommend you join courses offered by Logicmojo, Coding Ninjas or GeeksForGeeks. Not only algorithms but you must also understand why that works, proof, code it and analyze it. Thanks for reading and I hope this helps clear your doubts. Happy Coding!!"},{"prompt":"Should we boot Turkey out of NATO for playing silly games regarding the acceptance of Sweden as a NATO member?

They ignite the inspiration of others, encouraging them to embrace and pursue this vision while steering their teams with purpose and unwavering direction. 2. The Bedrock of Integrity Integrity serves as the foundation of effective leadership. Leaders with unwavering moral principles earn their teams’ and stakeholders’ trust, credibility, and loyalty. They lead by example, adhering to ethical conduct and transparency in every facet of their endeavors. 3. The Valor to Conquer Leaders must demonstrate courage in the face of challenges and uncertainty. They make difficult decisions, take calculated risks, and inspire their teams to step beyond the boundaries of their comfort zones. Courageous leaders instill confidence and create an environment that fosters growth. 4. The Gift of Empathy Empathy is the profound ability to understand and relate to the emotions and experiences of others. Leaders who exhibit empathy build robust relationships, cultivate a supportive work culture, and encourage collaboration. By genuinely caring for their team members, leaders create a sense of belonging and foster unwavering loyalty. 5. Mastering the Art of Effective Communication Leaders must skillfully communicate their vision, goals, and expectations with clarity and conciseness. They engage in attentive listening, cultivate an atmosphere of open conversation, and offer valuable constructive criticism. Effective communication fosters understanding, alignment, and a shared sense of purpose. 6. Embracing Adaptability In an ever-evolving world, leaders must be adaptable and receptive to new ideas. They embrace change, foster innovation, and lead by example in embracing technological advancements. Adaptable leaders inspire their teams to be flexible, resilient, and solution-oriented. 7.

Why or why not?","completion":"Karma is an interesting thing. (in Hinduism and Buddhism) the sum of a person's actions in this and previous states of existence, viewed as deciding their fate in future existences. INFORMAL destiny or fate, following as effect from cause. Now the interesting aspect is that when one looks at karma, one shouldn't see cause and reward but more of a binding sense of the attachments of your past, current and future lives. One should have respect for the lessons learned, avoid negative actions now in respect for your future. Making action, with the claim, \\"I am doing this action\\" is bringing into effect karma. Claiming any action, is in essence what binds karma.. It is this support of the belief of actively doing that binds karma. This is important because it's what creates the different versions and types of karma. When a buddha is utilizing their “buddha field” they are in essence using stored karmic action build though previous actions from previous lives. That's how pure lands are formed. This can also be said of one's own personal hell, or even the concept of hell itsself. In the end, karma is a universal force that is mainly cause and effect. Everyone experiencs it and everyone is subject. It's what you do with your karmic energy that really counts for this life and the next."},{"prompt":"Does a corporate credit card affect your personal credit?

Think about it this way: my solar wholesaler’s cost to me is about 50 cents per watt, i.e. a 300 watt panel will sell to me for about 150. I don’t know the sell price from the panel manufacturer to the wholesaler, but it is obviously less than 50 cents per watt. Let’s say it’s 40 cents per watt. Now consider all the costs involved in building the solar panel: a backsheet, glass on top, metal frame, a brick and mortar factory with robots everywhere, human labor and then the silicon. When the silicon is removed from a recycled panel it has other elements such as phosphorus in it that it was originally doped with. These elements must be removed from the silicon, melted down and then re doped. Compare this to getting new high quality silicon from a mining company with a quarry—this isn’t beach sand, it’s more like quartzite. I don’t know the cost comparison between the two but imagine what savings there might be and then imagine what percentage it would be of the 40 cents with all other expenses factored in. It won’t be much. Then there is everything else that is part of a solar installation: racking, inverter, conduit and wire runs, permitting, etc. Any savings from recycling is inconsequential in the big picture. Another thing to consider is that this will not even be a relevant question for at least another 20 years. It was only about 10 years ago that solar panels were being produced in any meaningful quantity and they can realistically be expected to last 30 years or more. This question is moot for now, but when the day comes I truly hope that the panels will be recycled—renewable energy is all about saving the earth and treating it with respect, that we love the earth."},{"prompt":"Why does Modi celebrate Deepavali every year with the Indian Army, even though India is a secular country, and he does not celebrate other religious festivals?","completion":"Yes off course India is a secular country if it was not than there were only Hindus… India has given place to live to all religions..

Some people think that it is expensive to invest but let me be clear if you think about the output, the investment you are doing now is very less as compared to that of the resultsNot making good notes, I myself did not had habit of making my own notes, atleast you can do is get topper notes from websites like notes4u, they provide good quality notes at very less pricesSpending too much time learning concepts and not on practicing questionsNot giving enough mocksSpending too much time on studies without any breaks, take a break of one day every week so your mind can get refreshedProcrastinating too much about results, than studying , thinking too much about the resultsTrying to cover up the whole syllabus, see you can leave some topics or a subject if you do not like it, as it will not make much difference. You do not have to score 100% marks to get a good rankLeaving the Non Tech portion like Aptitude, Reasoning and English. Aspirants do not focus much on them, but it is the easiest section of the GATE exam to score and takes very less time for preparation The mistakes are not exhaustive but you have to try to avoid them, if not avoid them do not repeat them. All the best for your GATE preparation !!"},{"prompt":"What do you think about the new Marvel comics characters Safespace, Snowflake, Trailblazer, B Negative and Screentime from “The New Warriors?”","completion":"Alright, i’m gonna take a crack at these guys. WHAT THE HELL are you guys doing over there at Marvel? What nonsense are you trying to shove down our throats this time? For those of you who don’t know, The New Warriors was a Marvel superhero team that debuted in 1989. Ah, who am i kidding? Almost every comic book reader has at least heard about them at this point what with all the attention this new team’s getting. The team consisted of Night Thrasher, Nova, Firestar, Speedball, Justice, Namorita, Darkhawk, Silhouette, and Rage. Now, of course, there have been different versions of the team with alternating members. This is sort of a staple thing in with Marvel teams, just look how many Avenger teams there are. Jesus. (New Avengers, West Coast, Avengers, Mighty Avengers, Great Lakes Avengers, Dark Avengers, Secret Avengers, etc.) But i think this version of the team is probably the worst to come out. I mean, the cringe levels are… OVER 9000!!! Now i’m gonna be honest (and i might discredit myself): I’ve only read a little bit of New Warriors (mainly the 2014 run). If i want to read a story about a superhero team, i mainly stick with the Fantastic Four. But enough of all that. Let’s see where this all started. The 2020 New Warriors were created by a guy by the name of Daniel Kibblesmith. Apparently, the man is afraid of buff dudes and blades. He also thought that the old New Warriors comic was “too cool” for him. I’m already seeing negative signs from this. As for the team members, i’m just gonna talk about each of them briefly. Here’s a link to find out more about them: [LINKED_TEXT: Introducing the New 'New Warriors'] [URL: https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/introducing-the-new-new-warriors] First we got Trailblazer, a Native American Teen with no powers that has a magic backpack from her grandpa that’s actually a pocket dimension. Hmm, a magical backpack, where have i heard that before? Ok yeah, i’m know that Dora’s backpack isn’t exactly magical (then again, it always seems to have what Dora needs) but it was the first thing that i thought of. Also about her name, Trailblazer, really? What, like the Trail of Tears or something? Why do i feel like i just pissed off some people? Now that i think about it, she’s kinda like a chubby Dora the Explorer. I’m not fat shaming, calm down people. Then again, the picture could imply that BUT I’M NOT. Next, we got Screentime, who according to his bio is: “A Meme-Obsessed super teen whose brain became connected to the internet after becoming exposed to his grandfather’s “experimental internet gas.” EXPERIMENTAL. INTERNET. GAS. FFS, this is starting to sound stupid already. Apparently, this guy’s powers only work if he’s connected to the internet which means he won’t get to enjoy his precious memes. Now that i think about it, all you would have to do to stop him from using his powers is to drag him to a forest or something or if he’s in your house, not give him the Wi-Fi password. The colors used for his character design kinda makes him look like a mascot for the old model of the Xbox 360. Now that i think about it, he probably has a Xbox-Live Account. If you want a better character with powers that came from the internet, look at Freakazoid. Then we got B Negative… According to Kibblesmith, he got his powers from a rogue blood transfusion in a medical procedure from Michael Morbius himself. Wow, B Negative, really? Is that supposed to be some kinda of “clever” pun or something? There are way better names to give a Vampire-themed hero! Alucard? Oh wait, that name’s taken. Demitri? Oops, not gonna happen! Count Nefaria? Out of the picture. Ok, then what about Nightfang? Or Vladamir? Or Lazarus? LITERALLY ANYTHING WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER!!! Now, i’ll admit, i kinda like that idea of him getting a supposed blood transfusion from Morbius and it could make his character more interesting..if it weren’t for his character design. I swear if Dracula from those Hotel Transylvania movies ever saw him, he would be like: AND AS FOR THESE TWO!! I mean, at first you would think these guys are some sort of parody because of their names which are based off derogatory slangs and their designs are based off the opposite gender associated color (because blue is usually attributed to boys and pink is usually attributed to girls). But i think Safespace is the one i gotta make more fun of. I mean, according to Kibblesmith: \\"Safespace is a big, burly, sort of stereotypical jock. He can create forcefields, but he can only trigger them if he's protecting somebody else. Hmm, his powers remind me of that one South Park episode And another thing, Burly? You call that Burly? Then what’s this then? Safespace looks more of an athletic-type than a burly-type to me at least. To add on, what’s so stereotypical about this guy? I have never seen jocks at my high school(or any high school for that matter) dye their hair pink, and wear pink earrings. As for Snowflake, i’ll be honest, i think i hate her the least out of everyone. But i’ll have to see what their personality is like. She seems like the only one on the team that i think is the least lame. I mean, apart from their name referring to overly sensitive people, she does seems to have at least a cool power. And i thought the Wonder Twins’s recent book was bad… Now that i think about it, these guys would probably get their butts kicked in a fight by other Marvel Teams, even most of the DC teams. Think about it: Trailblazer: No powers, no martial arts training, no weapons (maybe she’ll get one from her “mystical backpack”), overweight. Screentime: This guy seems to have no offense-based abilities, according to a quote from Kibblesmith. “Now he can see augmented reality and real-time maps, and can instantly Google any fact. Does this make him effectively a genius? He sure acts like it does.” To me, he just sounds like a support-type hero if you know what i mean. Like he can’t really fight but he can give you directions and stuff. B Negative: This guy i’m guessing is gonna be like a Teen-Morbius so he could be a legit fighter but he probably won’t have near the amount of experience. Plus, he’s probably a psuedo-vampire so he could have a good deal of super-strength. Safespace: This guy can only protect himself if he protecting someone else. If he gets split up from his teammates, he’s f**ked since it looks like he doesn’t have increased durability without his forcefields. Just split him up from his teammates, grab a handgun, ask him if he feels lucky, and shoot him in the head. Snowflake: I feel like they’d be the only real threat on the team due to their ice powers. But that would depend on how good their throwing skills are. But really, ask yourselves, would these guys stand a chance against any other Marvel Team? Young Avengers? Defenders? New Mutants? Guardians of the Galaxy? Champions? Teen Titans? Runaways? The JSA? or even the Great Lakes Avengers (or Lightning Rods, if you will)? After all i’ve said, i’ll leave you guys with this: Jesus, what the hell happened to you, Marvel? You guys were like the cool kids back in the day. I saw you guys as the Sega to DC’s Nintendo, if that makes sense at all. I guess it’s true, when Stan Lee died, so did MARVEL. It makes me wonder what the great Jack Kirby would’ve thought of this crap. He’s probably rolling over in his grave. When Stan left, he left space open for all this wokeness to spill into the Marvel Universe. All good things must come to an end, i guess. Even OC superheroes from DEVIANTART would be better than these guys! Tch, no wonder people read manga more nowadays… In the meantime, i’m gonna go read some My Hero Academia: Vigilantes…or maybe some Silver Age Marvel books."},{"prompt":"What are the main differences between musicals and operas?","completion":"Very simply, singers typically have microphones in musicals but not in operas."},{"prompt":"What is the best way to start learning PHP?","completion":"As a front-end developer, if you want to learn PHP, there are several online resources available that can help you.

It’s a sad truth for me to say, but as a teenager myself, I would like very much for adults to realize that we are cleverer than we act, that many of us do scorn you behind your backs, and mock you when you’re not looking. Many of us do whisper to one another when you say something, and giggle about it, and make fun of you for it. Please don’t treat us like we are so amazing or pure, because many of us probably aren’t. Many of us are just as cruel as the world, for that’s the heartless world we grew up in. Many of us will lie and cheat, no matter how much you might trust us. Many of us will do it. Many of us don’t care. That being said, we are not all rude, lazy, uneducated cell-phone addicts. We all need something to relieve us of our stress and worries; by being a generation that just so happens to grow up when phones are popular, you can’t blame us for using them. Some of us want to learn, some of us are kind. Some of us want to paint the world in a more beautiful color. We are not purposely trying to sit back and watch the world collapse around us, or our responsibilities come crashing down on our backs. Some of us are trying. Some of us are trying so hard. We are not as naïve as we may act. Maybe we are laughing with our friends, or talking in the hallways. Maybe we are grinning at some corny joke you cracked. Maybe we won’t stop talking in your class. But in no way does that mean we are living an oblivious lie, in a make-believe world that little children dream of. We know the world is a big place, and we’ve only seen a bit of it. But really, we know. We know society isn’t going to greet us with rainbow smiles and golden sunshine when we get older. We know we are going to have to fight our fears, and make tough choices sometimes. Because we are young, and we are curious. And we are only exploring these steps for the first time. And it’s scary. We know that. Many of us are trying to be kind people. We are not blind enough to not notice if something is wrong. We do not forget when somebody has been kind to us, because it may be the sole reason we made it through the day. We smile to ourselves when we are complimented; we don’t just forget about it. We don’t strut through the streets of our cities like it belongs to us, nor do we think we own the world and are the best at everything. We don’t think we will get our way by begging or demanding for it. Some of us care. Some of us care way too much. And some of us are kind. Some of us are kinder than the world deserves."},{"prompt":"the response to Ponniyin Selvan II movie a slipper shot given by the audience to the artificial hype created on Mani Ratnam?","completion":"Didn't Amazon Prime Algo provide the clue ?

To be honest, the movie was too quick for an Indian film, and they didn’t do justice to the actual story. Direction:- The direction was okay-ish, and kind of felt weird at times, and definitely the part where Manny gets sick and his health was deteriorating wasn’t portrayed in a correct manner. I felt it was too soon to show him slip into sickness. I felt there were many unconnected dots in the movie which need to be filled properly, it felt like a raw version of the movie. Sanjana Sanghi’s debut:- But the acting was excellent, the lead actors graced the movie. Though Sanjana is new to this acting world, she did justice to her role and it didn’t look like it’s her first movie. Indeed, she is very talented and has a lot of scope in the future. Sahil Vaid:- Coming to Manny’s friend JP, played by Sahil Vaid, he has done justice to his role and the scene where he reads Manny’s eulogy is really emotional and I couldn’t control my tears. Father-Mother duo:- The role of the mother and father duo have been played well by them, especially the father’s emotions were painful to watch and add sense to the story. The one and only Sushant Singh Rajput:- Finally, the role of Manny, played by our evergreen -lost-charming-kindhearted-dreamer Sushant Singh Rajput was picture perfect, it seems as though he never left, he is still alive through that movie. I personally feel that he was sad even through the movie and it could be read from his eyes that he is searching for something beyond this world, and that’s where God/our Creator has placed him now, in millions of our hearts in India and also worldwide. He has become a person who is finally valued after his death only. It’s the sad fate of our world, where when a person is with us, we don’t realise their importance, but suddenly when they leave, we get scarred and realise what we lost was a precious gem in the ocean. I just hope his legacy, though short lived stays forever in the history of Indian Cinema. Hope there are more Sushants’ who would shine and not give up before their value is realised. This was the look in his eyes when she read his eulogy :’( And one thing I would like to say is, though the movie was too short, it still conveyed beautiful emotions and was amazing and gave me more tears than the book which I’ve read. In the book, there was a particular line which I loved, the one which Hazel Grace aka Kizie Basu says in his eulogy: I cannot tell you how grateful I am for our little infinity. You gave me forever within the numbered days, and I'm grateful. This is what teared me to pieces, though everyone dreams of a forever with their significant other, only a few ones get to live their life to the fullest, and it pains to think of the millions who lose their loved ones on a day-to-day basis through various ailments, accidents and what not.

Velocity relative to what? Velocity is inherently a vector quantity and you can’t say anything about “final velocity” without knowing where and when your space cow originated. But, let’s assume you mean instantaneous velocity. The final instantaneous velocity of the space cow’s constituent components are approximately equal to zero. At least, from a reference frame of Earth’s surface. Or, perhaps you mean what the is terminal velocity of a cow falling from space through the Earth’s atmosphere? Well, that’s a bit more complicated. For the sake of absurd convenience, you might assume that your cow is spherical. From there, a few assumptions of the mass and radius of your average space cow will give you a fairly straight forward answer."},{"prompt":"T Madras mess has introduced separate entrance, utensils and basins for nonvegetarian students, some of whom are considering it as equivalent of 'untouchability'. What are your views on the matter?","completion":"I think it is good decision of IITM. In older time veg. and non-veg. students both uses same basin. Imagine if a non veg student who eaten chicken with there hands and uses tap with same hand, after him will a vegetarian student use the same tap without any sign on his face ?? No, because generally no-one (at-least some students) wash the tap properly after use nither there is any staff to wash the same. So to save the right of vegetarian students decision of the Institute to have separate facility is admirable. In other view if both type of students ( vegetarian and non vegetarian) have separate facility (basin and utensils) then it will not create any hesitation to Multi Tasking Staff (at-least to those (like Jain staff) who cant touch non vegetarian stuffs) while cleaning basins & utensils. Utensils are more intense issue then tap. At our home also we (most of Indians) have seperate utensils for veg. and non veg. family members and why not in hostel mess ?? And the sperate entrance is to ensure the above two. So My point of view this decision is taken by IIT Madras keeping in mind both veg students and MTS If any one can eat the different type of the food and it should not be any issue while using sperate facility for it or just before and after it."},{"prompt":"w can I lose 10 pounds in 3 weeks without exercising?","completion":"Looking to shed those extra pounds quickly and effortlessly?

Let’s apply this criteria to Duchess Satine of Clan Kryze’s reign over Mandalore… What did she hope to leave behind and did she achieve it? Satine was a firm believer in the New Mandalorian philosophy, and supported pacifism rather than war, going against centuries of tradition. Obviously, she hoped that by the time she died or otherwise stepped down from power, the Mandalorian people as a whole would have embraced pacifism. Did she achieve that? No. Her regime collapsed amidst chaos and destruction, so most Mandalorians wouldn’t hold a very high opinion of her or the ideals she preached. Even half a decade after the fall of the Empire, the Mandalorians we do see still wear armour and have no qualms about fighting. So Satine absolutely failed to implement pacifism in the long term. 2) Did her people enjoy a high standard of living? We know that Satine came to power shortly after a civil war that left most of Mandalore devastated - geographically and presumably economically. Not to mention all the fighting that would have taken place beforehand due to the old martial culture. That was in 42BBY and since Obi-Wan mentioned that he and Qui-Gon spent a year there to protect Satine, we can infer that the war (or the main phase) occurred within that time, meaning that Satine became Duchess either immediately after or close to that point. Okay, 42BBY to 22BBY, that’s twenty years. Let’s see what Satine had achieved in that time… Okay, yeah, I have to admit, everything appears top of the line. The cities look clean and orderly, they have working infrastructure, and you can’t deny that lots of open space in a city is a pretty good sign of prosperity. So Satine clearly did a good job of rebuilding Mandalore and getting the economy back on track. And while she did preach pacifism, she obviously wasn’t stupid in thinking there would never be trouble, either creating or maintaining the Mandalorian Guard… The Mandalorian Secret Service: And the Mandalorian Protectors: Satine also created the Ruling Council of Mandalore for advice and - we can infer - to create a stable line of succession. So both her and her successors would be well-advised in political and economical matters. In addition, we need to take into account Mandalore’s political situation. Considering its over reliance on trade (I will talk about this later), we can infer that Mandalore was well-connected with its neighbours and beyond. Additionally, the fact that out of 1,500 members of the Council of Neutral Systems, Mandalore was the one in charge, suggests that it had significantly more influence than we usually give it credit for. So, from 42BBY to 22BBY, it seems that Satine had been incredibly successful in raising her people’s standard of living. The cities looked well-ordered, clean and comfortable; suitable infrastructure had been put into place to accommodate the people’s needs; despite her ideology, Satine had maintained a military force to keep the peace; and the nation was well-connected politically. All of this strongly suggests that Mandalore was economically strong - which would have been the result of Satine’s policies post civil-war. All in all, It seems that Satine’s regime could thrive in peacetime. Peacetime. Let’s make something clear: the Clones Wars erupting was not Satine’s fault, but the short and long term impact of the war on her planet and people was. The planet’s economy turned from apparently strong to struggling and whatever policies she put into place to counter this change were too inefficient to make a difference. Not to mention, the black market established by her own Prime Minister brought in toxic and (I’m assuming) overpriced goods, leaving the population between a rock and a hard place. Oh, and this is a good place to mentioned all the corruption that was was brought out during the war. Including the Prime Minister that established a black market: The Governor of her planet’s moon that established a terrorist organisation: One of presumably many public officials that took bribes and embezzled public funds. The members of her security forces that worked for the black market. The infiltration of the Council of Neutral Systems by Death Watch sympathisers. So, while her people most probably enjoyed a reasonably high standard of living in an economically strong nation before the Clone Wars, Satine wasn’t able to protect them once the war broke out. This establishes a clear weakness in Satine’s regime: she managed to revive Mandalore’s economy and established strong trade routes with other systems, but she failed to ensure self-sufficiency in the case that trade would be cut off. The main problem appears to be a lack of food, and considering Mandalore’s desolate appearance, that doesn’t surprise me. But still, in the twenty years between Satine’s rise to power and the Clone Wars breaking out, I am shocked that none of the New Mandalorians thought “hey, if we can’t trade for food, we screwed. Maybe we should look into that?” However, I am not going to let the last three years of Satine’s life represent her career as a whole. Her regime was clearly flourishing in peacetime, and it wasn’t like Mandalore was the only planet suffering economically. Rodia had been pushed to the brink of starvation because of the war, to the point of making a deal with the Trade Federation. Plus, it is mentioned that there is rationing in Mandalore’s academies, so it’s clear that the problem was recognised quickly. So while I can’t let the end result of Satine’s reign slide, I am not going to ignore everything that came before. Satine gets half a point in this category. 3) Was the transition of power to her successor peaceful and ensured stability? We don’t know who Satine considered her successor, it could’ve been her nephew or someone on her Ruling Council? But we don’t know for sure, but what we do know is who her immediate successor was… Who was closely followed by… Which lead to… Which itself resulted in… Which culminated with… Though it wasn’t long before… Okay, so that’s… Let’s see… Give me a second… Two coups, one civil war, one invasion, one foreign occupation, and a total of four (five if you include Savage Opress) successors each coming to power in a very short span of time. No matter how you spin it, you can’t look at this series of disaster dominoes and not think poorly of Satine for not preventing it. Conclusion: Satine only has 0.5 out of 3. Her reforms were undone in the long term because she couldn’t keep her regime in power to enforce them; her people’s standard of living fell during the Clone Wars because she hadn’t done enough to ensure self-sufficiency - though during peacetime, the economy was significantly stronger; finally, immediately following her fall and death, Mandalore fell into a period of political instability and violence which were only ended by a brutal foreign occupation. I’m sorry I had to come to this conclusion, because it really is tragic that - after two decades of making progress - the last three years of Satine’s life saw everything she’d worked towards slowly crumbling."},{"prompt":"What is the significance of CMRR in opamp?","completion":"CMRR in an OP-AMP means Common Mode Rejection ratio. It is expressed as a ratio of differential gain of op-amp to its common gain and is expressed in dB (decibels). The primary job of an opamp is to amplify the differential voltage applied between the inverting and non inverting terminal { (V+) - (V-) }. For optimum amplification, the differential gain (Ad)must be as high as possible, while the common gain (Ac) must be minimum since high common gain induces noise and distortion in the output of op-amp. So, CMRR is basically the ability of an Op-am p to amplify the differential gain and at the same time rejecting the commin gain. Therefore, an ideal op-amp has infinite CMRR. Practically an Op-amp has a CMRR in the range of 80 - 95 dB."},{"prompt":"After losing everything that you own, what would you do?","completion":"[LINKED_TEXT: ] [URL: https://qr.ae/pruPij]"},{"prompt":"What puzzles you most about humans?","completion":"The large number that will not use their brain."},{"prompt":"What are some of the shrewdest, smartest military maneuvers ever seen?Was it a significant point in history?","completion":"Blitzkrieg…………..I know its not a official maneuver but it was awesome in its results."},{"prompt":"What are some things that only electrical and electronics engineers know, but most people don't?","completion":"It was the invention of the transformer that has brought power to every corner of the globe and not the wires or generators.

Music might be played in public transport, in a workplace, while a student is working, to help a baby go to sleep. However, there exists an infinite form of music which makes them different from each other. No matter what the differences are, music itself is the key element in each form of music. After all, music is the universal language able to break through any barriers hampered by the linguistic process. However, Opera is a really specific and unique genre of Music and one of the things which helps make opera what it is, is the combined form of different arts it unites. Indeed, [LINKED_TEXT: Opera music] [URL: https://www.operabase.com/highlights/en] is a combination of singing, drama, dancing, plastic art and music. Once all of these concepts are united in some ways, the end results are usually performed in a theatrical setting. Opera is an art of emotion seen differently from other forms of music because of the linguistic links with the emotion that emerges from each [LINKED_TEXT: Opera performance] [URL: https://www.operabase.com/productions/en]. Indeed, since the operas originated from Italy, most of the operas were performed in Italian but diversified into several languages afterwards. The elements of emotions, costumes, scenery, acting and sometimes dancing, is one of the things that distinguishes an opera from other forms of regular music. Opera is a historic form of music that has touched people's souls since 400 years and continues to do so today. This historical aspect might also be related to some operas which based their story on Greco-Roman mythology. But beyond this historical aspect specific to the opera, the personification of the characters is also a significant element which allows the public to easily identify themselves to an opera character. This what makes opera so popular and widely loved is the ability it has to connect with everyone. Although there are numerous forms of music, nothing compares to an opera: the singers, the dramatic climate, the language, the emotion, the history, the costumes... It is said that people who experience an opera performance, either love it forever or remain with mixed feelings. But if they do love it, it will touch and change them for the rest of their lives."},{"prompt":"w far can a Modern Greek speaker go before Ancient Greek becomes unintelligible?

Here is an analysis of the potential risks and benefits: Potential Risks: Market Uncertainty: International markets often come with greater uncertainty due to factors such as cultural differences, political instability, regulatory complexities, and economic fluctuations. Companies may face challenges in understanding and adapting to these unfamiliar business environments.Increased Competition: Expanding internationally exposes a company to intensified competition from local and global players. Established competitors with a deeper understanding of the market may already have strong market share, customer loyalty, and established distribution networks.Operational Complexities: Expanding into international markets can bring logistical challenges, including supply chain management, transportation, customs regulations, and local infrastructure limitations. These complexities can increase costs and operational risks.Legal and Regulatory Compliance: Each country has its own legal and regulatory frameworks that companies must navigate. Compliance with foreign laws, tax regulations, intellectual property protection, and labor laws can be complex and time-consuming.Currency and Financial Risks: Conducting business in different currencies exposes a company to currency fluctuations, exchange rate risks, and potential losses. Economic instability in target markets can impact profitability and financial performance. Potential Benefits: Increased Market Potential: Expanding internationally allows access to new markets with a larger customer base, potentially leading to increased revenue and growth opportunities. It can diversify a company's customer portfolio and reduce dependence on a single market.Revenue Growth and Profitability: Successful international expansion can lead to increased sales and profitability. Entering untapped markets with fewer competitors can provide a first-mover advantage and higher profit margins.Economies of Scale: Expanding operations internationally can lead to economies of scale through increased production volume, lower production costs, and improved purchasing power. This can enhance efficiency and profitability.Portfolio Diversification: Expanding into international markets diversifies a company's risk by reducing dependence on a single market or region. This can provide stability during economic downturns in specific markets.Access to Resources and Talent: International expansion provides opportunities to access new resources, technology, and talent pools. Companies can tap into local expertise, innovation, and specialized skills that can enhance competitiveness and drive innovation.Learning and Knowledge Transfer: Expanding globally exposes a company to new ideas, best practices, and different business models. It facilitates cross-cultural learning, knowledge transfer, and the development of a more diverse and globally-minded workforce.Enhanced Brand Image and Reputation: Establishing a presence in international markets can enhance a company's brand image, reputation, and global recognition. It can position the company as a global player and increase credibility in the eyes of customers, partners, and stakeholders. Companies considering international expansion should conduct thorough market research, assess potential risks, develop a robust market entry strategy, and carefully manage resources to maximize the benefits and minimize the challenges associated with expanding into new markets"},{"prompt":"What is the biggest problem with the modern education system?","completion":"“I’m very passionate about learning, I love working with a team, and I’ve always been in the top ten of my classes.”, I wrote. The problem was, there were only ten students in my class that semester. The bold letters of the application form scared me. “Tell us about your academic achievements, and how you demonstrate excellence in the classroom.” I had tried wording my response in a thousand different ways, but nothing sounded right. Applications like these, whether they were for clubs, leadership roles, or even universities, used to come easily to me. I was recognized as gifted in fourth grade, and I watched, usually from the sidelines, as my classmates - what our teachers called “like-minded peers” - took on piles after piles of essays and worksheets, and received stacks of boxes filled with trophies and certificates that they’d never look at again. First place, of course. Because getting second is as good as getting nothing at all. In our education system, mediocrity is unacceptable. There are so many kids out there, who, like me, would pride themselves on never ever ever getting a B. But underneath all of those hefty academic achievements, I think a lot of students are genuinely struggling. When you’re told from a young age that your standard is excellence, and that the only way to succeed, go to uni, and get a good job is to outshine others, people often start seeing in black and white.[LINKED_TEXT: ¹] [URL: https://medium.com/mindsets/gifted-kid-burnout-breaking-free-of-smartness-2c29e71a6cd0] Something is acceptable, or a complete failure. You’re either doing well in school, or you’re dumb. In my sophomore math class, nine out of ten students received marks above 91.² But even the highest scoring kids in that class still felt inadequate compared to each other, and faced tremendous stress in terms of their marks - because they’ve been conditioned by our school system to set themselves to impossible standards, and in turn, to base their self-worth on how well they can achieve them. It seems sad to me that the attempts by the school system in “promoting excellence” has turned into something so toxic. footnotes: [LINKED_TEXT: ¹] [URL: https://medium.com/mindsets/gifted-kid-burnout-breaking-free-of-smartness-2c29e71a6cd0] - the link to a really good medium article i read about the topic! the part that stood out to me the most is as follows: Research done by Professor Carol Dweck (author of Mindsets: The New Psychology of Success) shows that giving kids positive labels such as “gifted”, “talented”, or “smart” in their formative years pushes them into what she calls a “fixed mindset”: believing that qualities are “set in stone”, “fearing challenge and devaluing effort” — with a fixed mindset, people “[don’t] want to do anything that could expose their flaws and call into question their talent.” - H.

Today, lead generation in the digital world is bigger than ever and represents a huge online industry in which lead generation businesses compete over countless products and services. Niches Worth Looking Into The following lead generation niches are worth looking into because they are large, profitable, and satisfy some of the aforementioned criteria concerning the viability of doing business in these markets. 1. Legal The legal niche is always competitive but profitable. The legal leads niche encompasses a wide variety of fields from traffic law to family, criminal, health care, and intellectual property. There are so many sub-niches that you can choose to specialize in a certain field within a specific geographic market. 2. Plastic Surgeons Cosmetic surgery marketing is all about finding qualified leads and presenting them with attractive offers. 3. Insurance Insurance is one of the biggest lead generation niches out there (think of how many insurance advertisements you see each week). Then consider that almost everyone is a qualified lead. 4. Loans and Credit Cards Credit cards, loans, and other financial products are similar to insurance products in that they are typically commoditized and many people are qualified to receive them. There are loans for a wide variety of purposes (like there are insurance products for a variety of circumstances). 5. Home Services and Remodeling Local businesses, sole proprietors, and general and independent contractors play a big role in the home services and remodeling niche market. It’s a broad category that includes any individual or general contractor that can be hired to perform renovations and essential home services like painting, plumbing, landscaping, and HVAC installation.

I saw my own grandfather take tobacco, put it on a piece of creased cigarette rolling paper and then roll it into a “tube” (more or less), lick the edge of the paper to seal the roll, then light it up for a smoke. And Zig Zag cigarette rolling papers began business in 1855. This person’s a wimp because they use water instead of spit, but you get the point.

However, with a little bit of planning and creativity, you can create engaging content that resonates with your audience and helps you achieve your social media goals. Here are some tips on how to generate content for social media: 1. Define Your Goals Before you start creating content, it's important to define your goals for social media. Are you looking to increase brand awareness, drive website traffic, or generate leads? Once you have a clear understanding of your goals, you can create content that aligns with your objectives. 2. Know Your Audience To create content that resonates with your audience, you need to know who they are and what they're interested in. Conduct market research or use social media analytics tools to gather information about your audience's demographics, interests, and behaviors. This will help you create content that is relevant and valuable to them. 3. Use a Content Calendar A content calendar is a great way to plan and organize your social media content. It allows you to schedule posts in advance, ensuring a consistent flow of content and avoiding last-minute scrambling. Use your content calendar to plan out your content themes, types of content, and posting schedule. 4. Leverage User-Generated Content User-generated content (UGC) is content created by your customers or followers. It can be a great way to engage with your audience and build brand loyalty. Encourage your followers to share their experiences with your brand and use their content in your social media posts. 5. Create Visual Content Visual content such as images and videos tend to perform better on social media than text-only posts. Use high-quality images and videos that align with your brand's aesthetic and message. You can also use tools like Canva or Adobe Spark to create eye-catching graphics and visuals. 6. Use Hashtags Hashtags are a great way to increase the visibility of your content and reach new audiences. Use relevant hashtags that align with your content and industry. You can also create branded hashtags to increase brand awareness and encourage user-generated content. 7. Share Industry News and Trends Sharing industry news and trends can help position your brand as a thought leader in your industry. Keep up with the latest news and trends and share your insights with your audience. You can also share content from other industry leaders and thought influencers. 8. Engage with Your Audience Social media is a two-way conversation, so it's important to engage with your audience. Respond to comments and messages, ask questions, and encourage feedback. This will help build relationships with your audience and create a sense of community around your brand. In conclusion, generating content for social media requires a combination of planning, creativity, and audience research. By defining your goals, knowing your audience, using a content calendar, leveraging UGC, creating visual content, using hashtags, sharing industry news and trends, and engaging with your audience, you can create engaging content that resonates with your audience and helps you achieve your social media goals.

It is indeed difficult to compare them. As other answers point out, Ms Jayalalithaa did not have advantages such as being our first Prime Minister's daughter. To some extent, the disliked qualities of being excessively obstinate, dogged, almost rabid, is more understandable when seen in that perspective. Why, if Jayalalithaa were to come back to power in 1980 like Indiraji, she might have even totally re-reversed everything done to the Constitution in the mean time! Added to this, while the culture of having personal animosity mixed up with political rivalry was definitely bigtime compounded by Ms Jayalalithaa herself, I think it was more present in Tamil Nadu's politics than in national politics even before her. I think that before Smt Sonia Gandhi / UPA it was almost absent in national politics. Tamil Nadu's politics was definitely made more personality-centric with the arrival of MGR itself. Both Smt Indira Gandhi and Ms Jayalalithaa are both to be emulated when it comes to secularism, but I still admire Ms Jayalalithaa more. Indiraji did dabble in appeasement and soft Hindutva a bit — but she paid the ultimate price for this to prevent these experiments from damaging to country's unimpeachable secular fabric, because she was secular from within. Jayaji on the other hand, was as secular in the means as the ends. Her explanation to the Press as to why the broadcast Viswaroopam was delayed is a case in the point. Her interview with Karan Thapar is a gem. She insists with so much composure that she is religious, and she is rational. This almost false dichotomy had almost become the lamentable mainstay in Tamil Nadu's politics for some time. While I don't want to go into details of my thoughts on this, hope it suffices to say atheists have their own idiosyncrasies. I haven't lived through the time of Indiraji's leadership, but I definitely think she had more refinement and class. But then again, with rivals like Vajpayeeji or Morarji Desaiji, that much class is just part of course."},{"prompt":"What do British conservatives think about such things as gun rights, ending abortion, ending gay marriage, and restoring the death penalty?","completion":"Many of the answers highlight the difference between ‘freedom from’ and ‘freedom to’!"},{"prompt":"What is a proxy, and how can I use one?","completion":"A proxy server is basically an intermediary between you and the internet.

To be clear - it will not supplant all core backend technologies as many large firms ‘backends’ are comprised of multiple technologies, not just a single one. The primary reason is quite simple - applications that are written in javascript on the front end and backend are generally considered by many as easier and more cost effective to build and maintain. If I am exceptionally proficient in javascript, which already accounts for many components of the web, using it on the backend allows me to make changes more quickly. The following companies have spoken openly about moving towards or making heavy use of node.JS, partially for the aforementioned reason: eBayNASAUberWalmartNetflixLinkedin Consulting firms that specialize in Node.JS such as [LINKED_TEXT: Zibtek.com] [URL: http://zibtek.com/] are also better able to quickly develop scalable applications with the technology as writing the frontend and backend components in effectively the same languages allows for faster times to market.

A couple of years or so back my wife’s parents had come back from their vacation & we had gone to pick them up at the airport. Turned out they had by mistake taken one suitcase which didn’t belong to them - it looked exactly like the one they had, so it was an unintentional mixup as they did not check the name on luggage tag that airlines attach to each checked in luggage. They had just come out of the airport when my wife’s father got the call from airline staff explaining about this mixup. We checked all the suitcases they had & found one which was not theirs and he told the airline staff where we were standing & asked them if we should come back inside. They just told us to wait where we were & in 5 minutes one person from airline came and took us back to their counter where we returned the suitcase to the owner with our sincere apologies and got our own suitcase back (which we did check this time). So if you think someone else has taken your luggage then you just have to go to airline or airport support staff and let them know. Most likely someone in your flight would’ve taken your luggage by mistake and their own luggage would still be unclaimed - so it would be easy to know who that person is and airline would be able to call them up to explain the situation and you will get your luggage back & that person will get the correct luggage belonging to them."},{"prompt":"When cooking, is stir fry the same process as French sauté?","completion":"No. There is more liquid in a saute or braise, often broth/stock.

Understandably there was wide political support both amongst politicians and the public. Still is. As for gay marriage, that was also finally passed by the conservative party, again with cross party support. There used to be this idea amongst American conservatives as well as British ones, that the government shouldn't interfere too much. Basically it's not the government's responsibility to say two men or two women can't get married.

I lease cars I have researched and driven and know that I like. Leasing allows me to get that car, without spending a dime up front, for a lower payment then if I bought it outright. My intent is to keep the car at the end of the lease so I refinance the balloon payment which is always going to be even less of a payment than when I got the car new. A couple more years of payments and I own it outright. I usually keep it for 2 years after its paid off. In the end I had a car for about 10 years, 2 of which had no payments. It will have about 120,000 miles on it when I am ready for a new one. Currently on my second lease in the \\"balloon period\\" with about 1 more year to go.

It’s your magic, frankly. Your resourcefulness is incredibly strong. It’s how you’re made. One of your strengths is the ability to pick up on the emotional tone of a room. Spend more time listening and reading moments with others than talking and you’ll do yourself huge favors personally and professionally. Hone your strategic thinking and take nothing personally. Your heart is genuine and it won’t matter more than you’ll feel good about - hate to break it to you. Hard learning for us ENFPs. You are fair-minded and justice-oriented very often and there are times outcomes won’t seem fair or just to you. Be thoughtful about what you challenge. Keep moving forward. Some people aren’t your people and that’s a good thing. It means you aren’t in people pleaser mode - easy to do as an ENFP. When some people don’t like you - it’s to your credit. I promise. There’s a relatively common vibe from some people indicating they don’t trust ENFP follow through. I’ve never had trouble with this as one myself since I can’t stand unfinished projects and I can’t stand promising results I don’t deliver. So I’m not sure how common this lack of follow through issue is with others. However, the thinking is there and it’s real, so take this seriously. Respect the view and smash it with accomplishment. Meet AND exceed expectations. That alone can help you get ahead of the game. You have incredible potential and, thus, possibilities ahead of you as an ENFP - creatively and cerebrally. Plenty often those two come together with fantastic results for you. You tend to be capable of doing whatever it is you decide to do because you function well living between heart and head. Make it a habit to pin down results and the sky is pretty much the limit. I know many ENFPs and here are some basic commonalities I’ve noticed. You’re vibrant. You’re fun. You’re friendly. You’re fascinating. You’re sharp. You’re an excellent builder of what you decide to do. Your perspective is interesting because of your skill in looking at things with an open mind from multiple angles. Not everyone can do this well, much less as instinctively as you can. Sure - you can get distracted, but it might merely mean you’ve overwhelmed yourself with possibility and just need to slow down and take on your goal one piece at a time. I’ll take overenthusiasm that goes with overwhelm any day over a simpler methodical linear type of thinking. It has definite value, but you’re uniquely you and it’s special in what you can achieve. All of this together is your currency in life. Use it wisely and don’t give it away. It’s something I’m proud of about myself. I’ve always known I had value and had requirements, behaving accordingly. I’ve never regretted acting on my own behalf with that self-awareness in mind. Use your business mind to set yourself up for success. Require others to respect what you bring to the table. It can be easy to take from you given your innate flexibility and resilience. Keep a close eye on this and stand ground for yourself without apology. You have oodles of options as an ENFP. Your main battle in life might well be not allowing others to squash you with envy or opportunism. It happens. You weren’t designed for status quo, so don’t beat yourself up about that instinct you have to buck the system. Use it as the fuel you need to make things happen. Decide not to be intimidated, keep that awesomely kind, idealistic heart of yours intact, employ those hard-earned street smarts, move on with self-compassion from those who don’t respect your value, and go for it."},{"prompt":"Which rock band has had the most messed up/dysfunctional history?","completion":"I don’t know the story behind all rock bands, but there are two that come to mind for me.

The Red Planet! On the internet, you can easily google to learn about the latest scientific discoveries and up-to-date details regarding Mars. But today I want to take you on a lesser known yet a bit more thought-provoking journey to Mars; have you ever wondered as to why Mars is called the Red Planet and why the ancient Romans named their god of war after Mars? If you have, then you are in luck. Mars is popularly known as the Red Planet because of its distinct rusty color. The planet's color can even be seen with the naked eye from Earth, appearing in the night sky as though it were a red star. The Red Planet is red for two main reasons: its surface, and its atmosphere. The surface of Mars is covered in iron oxide particles, which is the same compound that gives rust its red color. Mars has so much iron oxide on its surface because the planet is smaller and has weaker gravity than Earth does. Earth's larger size and stronger gravity meant molten rock was under higher pressure in its early days, resulting in higher temperatures. This turned the iron oxide into liquid, and caused it to sink down to the planet's core. Mars, being smaller, did not achieve the same temperatures. The iron oxide remained stable, didn't sink so much, and as a result is more spread out around the planet today, giving its trademark rusty color. Mars’ iron oxide covered surface The second reason for Mars' distinct redness is its atmosphere which has been extensively analyzed by NASA’s Curiosity rover that landed on the Red Planet in 2012. Scientists found that Mars' atmosphere at the surface consists of 95 percent carbon dioxide, 2.6 percent nitrogen, 1.9 percent argon, 0.16 percent oxygen, and 0.06 percent carbon monoxide. Mars' atmosphere appears red because so much of the planet's iron oxide dust gets blown around in enormous storms. These dust storms occur every year, and some are so big they cover areas the size of continents and can last for weeks at a time. Some, which are more rare, circle the entire planet and have caused NASA rovers to stop working. Another reason Mars' atmosphere looks red is more complicated, and involves the way sunlight reflects off of the planet. Image taken by the Viking 1 orbiter in June 1976, showing Mars thin atmosphere and dusty, red surface. Credits: NASA/Viking 1 Mars' atmosphere is thinner than Earth's, which is one reason why humans wouldn't be able to survive there without a spacesuit. Due to this thin atmosphere, sunlight that is reflected away from Mars appears red due to a phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering—or the lack of it. Rayleigh scattering occurs when light hits particles that are smaller in size than the wavelength of that light, such as gas particles in the Earth's atmosphere. This process tends to scatter blue light and is the same reason the Earth's sky looks blue in the daytime. On Mars there is less gas for the sunlight to interact with, so Rayleigh scattering does not occur as much. Conversely, on Mars there is a process called Mie scattering, in which sunlight hits particles that are roughly the same size as the wavelength of that light—such as iron oxide particles. This process tends to deflect blue light less than red light. Since we now know whence comes the Red Planet’s redness, we can move on to explore the idea behind Romans’ naming their God of War in honor of Mars. Statue of Roman God of War, Mars from the Forum of Nerva (2nd century CE) In the Roman pantheon, Mars was the god of war as well as the guardian of agriculture and the Roman people. Mars was the son of Jupiter and Juno, and was pre-eminent among the Roman army's military gods. Most of his festivals were held in March, the month named for him (Latin Martius), and in October, which began the season for military campaigning and ended the season for farming. Mars gave his name to the third month in the Roman calendar, Martius, from which English \\"March\\" derives. In the most ancient Roman calendar, Martius was the first month. But, actually, Romans named the planet Mars after their god, not the other way around. The reason was that Romans believed, allegorically and philosophically, the planet and the god shared characteristics. “Mars and Rhea Silvia” by Rubens (1620) It is not a mere coincidence that, in many modern languages, Tuesday is named for the planet Mars or the god of war: In Latin, martis dies (\\"Mars's Day\\"), survived in Romance languages as “marte” (Portuguese), “martes” (Spanish), “mardi” (French), “martedì” (Italian), “marți” (Romanian), and “dimarts” (Catalan). In Irish (Gaelic), the day is “An Mháirt”, while in Albanian it is “e Marta”. Interestingly, the English word “Tuesday” derives from Old English \\"Tiwesdæg\\" and means \\"Tiw's Day\\", “Tiw” being the Old English form of the Proto-Germanic war god “Tîwaz”, or “Týr” in Norse. Most mythologists believe that the reason as to why the planet Mars was named after the Roman god of war was that ancient peoples associated Mars with bloodshed and war because of its red color. In fact, Romans were not the only society to associate the planet with bloodshed. The ancient Babylonians called Mars, Nergal after their god of fire, war, and destruction. Nergal as depicted on an ancient Parthian relief carving No wonder, ominous, reddish specter of the Red Planet in the sky is associated with war, bloodshed and destruction across ancient civilizations."},{"prompt":"What are the best baby skin care products?","completion":"maybe this baby skin care [LINKED_TEXT: Aveeno Baby Welcome Little One Gift Basket, Baby Skincare Set with Baby Body Wash & Shampoo, Calming Bath Wash, All Over Baby Wipes, & Daily Moisturizing Lotion, 5 ItemsAveeno Baby Welcome Little One Gift Basket with four skin care essentials specially formulated with oats for baby's delicate skin & hair.

[LINKED_TEXT: Pfizer Announces Positive Top-Line Results from Phase 2b/3 Trial of Ritlecitinib in Alopecia Areata– ALLEGRO 2b/3 trial met primary efficacy endpoint of improving scalp hair regrowth – NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced positive top-line results from the Phase 2b/3 ALLEGRO trial evaluating oral once-daily ritlecitinib in patients with alopecia areata, an autoimmune disease driven by an immune attack on the hair follicles that causes hair loss on the scalp and can also affect the face and body. 1,2 Ritlecitinib 50 mg and 30 mg achieved the primary efficacy endpoint of the study, namely the proportion of patients with less than or equal to 20 percent scalp hair loss after six months of treatment versus placebo. “We are pleased by these positive results for ritlecitinib in patients with alopecia areata, a devastating and complex autoimmune disease for which there are currently no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines Agency approved treatments,” said Michael Corbo, PhD, Chief Development Officer, Inflammation & Immunology, Pfizer Global Product Development. “We look forward to bringing this potential new treatment option to patients living with alopecia areata as soon as possible.” The Phase 2b/3 ALLEGRO trial met the primary efficacy endpoint of improving scalp hair regrowth. All participants entered the study with at least 50 percent scalp hair loss due to alopecia areata, as measured by the Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score. A statistically significantly greater proportion of patients who took ritlecitinib 30 mg or 50 mg once-daily, with or without a four-week initial treatment of 200 mg once-daily, had 20 percent or less scalp hair loss (an absolute SALT score ≤20) after 24 weeks of treatment compared with placebo. This was followed by a 24-week extension period, during which all participants initially randomized to receive ritlecitinib continued on the same regimen, while participants who received placebo during the initial 24 weeks advanced to one of two regimens: 200 mg for four weeks followed by 50 mg for 20 weeks, or 50 mg for 24 weeks. The study also included a 10 mg dosing arm, which was assessed for dose-ranging and was not tested for statistically significant efficacy compared to placebo. The safety profile seen with ritlecitinib was consistent with previous studies. Overall, the percentage of patients with adverse events (AEs), serious AEs and discontinuing due to AEs was similar across all treatment groups. The most common AEs seen in the study were nasopharyngitis, headache and upper respiratory tract infection. There were no major adverse cardiac events (MACE), deaths or opportunistic infections in the trial. Eight patients who were treated with ritlecitinib developed mild to moderate herpes zoster (shingles). There was one case of pulmonary embolism in the ritlecitinib 50 mg group, which was reported to have occurred on Day 169. There were two malignancies (both breast cancers) reported in the ritlecitinib 50 mg group, which were reported to have occurred on Day 68 anhttps://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-announces-positive-top-line-results-phase-2b3-trial] [URL: https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-announces-positive-top-line-results-phase-2b3-trial]Nothing to see here folks"},{"prompt":"Where can I find packers and movers in Noida?","completion":"Airgo [LINKED_TEXT: Packers and Movers Noida] [URL: http://www.airgopackers.com/packers-movers-noida/] is a main packing, moving and transportation specialist organization Company in Noida.

Avoid or limit processed foods, sugary snacks, and high-calorie beverages.Portion Control: Be mindful of portion sizes to avoid overeating. Use smaller plates and bowls to help control portions and prevent overindulgence.Stay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Sometimes, thirst can be mistaken for hunger, leading to unnecessary snacking.Regular Exercise: Incorporate regular physical activity into your routine. Aim for a mix of cardiovascular exercises (like walking, jogging, or cycling) and strength training (using weights or resistance bands) to help burn calories and build muscle.Mindful Eating: Pay attention to your body's hunger and fullness cues. Eat slowly and savor your food to prevent overeating.Sleep Well: Ensure you're getting enough quality sleep each night. Poor sleep can affect hormones that regulate hunger and appetite, leading to weight gain.Reduce Stress: High stress levels can lead to emotional eating. Practice stress-reduction techniques like meditation, deep breathing, yoga, or spending time in nature.Limit Sugary Foods: Minimize your consumption of sugary foods and beverages, as they can contribute to weight gain and provide empty calories.Include Fiber: Foods rich in fiber, such as whole grains, legumes, fruits, and vegetables, can help you feel fuller for longer and support healthy digestion.Set Realistic Goals: Set achievable weight loss goals and track your progress over time.

In the following article, we will discuss the various types of cosmetic dental procedures available, to help you make an informed decision. Restorative dental treatments are those that are performed in order to repair a broken, decayed, or missing tooth. Most people seek dental treatment because there is something wrong with their teeth. Often times, people experiencing dental pain, swelling, or bleeding seek dental care to alleviate these problems with restorative dental care.Cosmetic dental treatments, on the other hand, are elective procedures used to alter the color, shape, size, alignment, and spacing of teeth. Most people seek cosmetic dental treatment as a result of not being happy with the appearance of their smile, rather than because they are experiencing symptoms. Therefore, while restorative dental treatments must be performed to alleviate symptoms and repair the tooth, cosmetic dental treatments do not have the same urgency.

Then justify the de-coupling with the super-positioning concept from both Newtonian physics and/or just physics in general. okay so this is how it goes : dissipative structure is a form of physical structure in which the matters composes this structure is dynamic and is constantly replaced, think of the waterfall itself, the water in it changes, but the “waterfall” as a structure exist beyond just the material identity, but also it’s informational identity. this informational identity includes both the static abstraction of the idea something is falling, and the dynamic movements in the meaning of the word “fall”. When you ask “what something is”, like in the case of the ship of theseus, the question can be asked on multiple level of abstraction, of the two most important abstraction, the two that also embodies the spirit of the philosophical question itself the closest, are : 1. what is the ship physically in the composition of it’s materials?2. what is the ship as an assembly of set of information?the dissipative system theory indicates that the composition of the material has to be similar in it’s individual unit informational structure, but not the exact molecule. example : an hydrogen atom is similar to another hydrogen atom, but may not be the exact same hydrogen atom.it also state that the overarching abstraction of the information regarding the composition of the ship has to be structurally and functionally similar but do not have to be composed of the exact same atoms. so the answer is: ship is not the same ship on the material level of analysis in regarding to its identity, but the same ship on the information level of analysis in regarding to its identity.the de-coupling itself is a very common concept in math and physicsthe idea is that any complex information abstractions can be reduce to it’s parts and then super-positioned on top of each other to recreate the original complex informational abstraction.the common example here would be : think of a wheel rolling, the motion of the wheel is not just a transitional one, but also a rotational one. The two different motions can be analyzed independent of each other, but neither independent motion describe the act of rolling, one is simply rotational like a standing spinning wheel, while the other is simply transitional like a circle gliding across space without and rolling motion. Once these two different motions are super-positioned on top of each other does it create a composite motion of rolling. So then the question becomes : is human’s understanding of an identity of an object on the level of information or the level of material, and so far we’ve known that it is on the level of the information more so than it is on the level of the material. but these two different levels of analysis can be super-positioned for a more holistic identity determination. however if we can prove that time dimension is similar to our spacial dimension in any way, then we can assume that the identity of any object is only informational as the material of an object at time point 1 will be entirely different from the material of that “same object” at time point 1+Delta(t). There is a more human-centric approach to the question of identity in relation to the legal ownership of an object or information regarding such objects like patent or copyrights, but that should be easily solvable once you get a good lawyer."},{"prompt":"w does one get officially married if they don’t believe in God?

Democracy involves distributing power locally. But everywhere there is centralisation of power, from families to political parties. Since all Indians think in this undemocratic manner, the rules and laws that are passed are unfair to the common man, and unfair rules result in corruption.

The human being has a spiritual component to him (or her). There exists two realms, the physical and the spiritual. The physical is the realm of power. Everything you can physically percive and interact with. The spiritual realm is the realm of love. In a family, a man works all day in a job he hates to provide for his wife and children. In the physical realm, this sounds a lot like slavery but in the spiritual realm, he loves them and if they show appreciation for his effort and sacrifice then that will strengthen him and give him satisfaction (what you call happiness). In the same family, the woman submits and follows her husband. In the physical realm, he has power over her but in the spiritual realm, she shows him love by showing him respect and believing in him. He in turm must not be a tyrant and impose his will on her. She feels safe with him that she can submit to him. When you see a submissive wife or an overworked husband and you think “look at them. They are powerless”, you are looking from the physical realm. If you look through the spiritual realm you'll see that they are fulfilled satisfied with themselves and their lives."},{"prompt":"What has led to China's falling foreign trade figures?","completion":"The Debt Reality Of China By using limited national power to handle W estern tradeThe excess capabilities are spreading to developing countriesOnly sufficient accumulation could initiate the power balance again"},{"prompt":"What are the characteristics of a genuine person?","completion":"Picture this: You meet someone and after chatting for a bit, you just can't shake off this feeling of comfort. Like you can let your guard down. Like you're seen and heard for who you truly are, no judgment attached. Chances are, you've just encountered a genuine person. So, what's the magic formula? Well, there's no one-size-fits-all, but there are a few things that genuine folks often have in common: 1. Honesty: Genuine people say what they mean, and mean what they say. They're not into sugar-coating or manipulative games. 2. Consistency: They are pretty much the same person, whether you meet them at a party or run into them at the grocery store. They're not one person at work and a completely different person at home. 3. Empathy: They can put themselves in other people's shoes and respond with kindness and understanding. It's not about pity, it's about compassion. 4. Self-reflection: Genuine folks aren't afraid to look at themselves, warts and all. They own their mistakes and learn from them. 5. Respect for others: They appreciate the uniqueness of each individual and respect their choices, even if they don't agree with them. 6. Non-materialistic: Sure, they might enjoy the good things in life, but they don't define their worth (or others') based on possessions or status. 7. Presence: When they're with you, they're really with you. They're not half in the conversation, half in their phone. Remember, nobody's perfect and everyone can have off days. But if these qualities sound like someone you know, there's a good chance you've got a genuine person in your life. And if they sound like the person you want to be? Well, congrats, you've just taken the first step towards that. Keep it real!

It is said that you could sleep on the street with your money next to you and no one would dare take your money, The penalty was Vlad’s spear, not much mercy for illegal things. He was also famous for using the spear thing on the Turkish invaders. You have to remember the history is what other people want us to know about what happened. They told us lots of romantic stories about what happened in the past and how our rulers were. If you ask someone else, let’s say a Turkish national, the story may be different, Vlad may be a crazy bastard that killed for no good reason.

Incidentally, I disagree with the comment that's been made on this forum that virtually writes him off from 1975. I saw him on 4 occasions as Page and Plant and he was playing very well, albeit not to quite the intensity of early LZ but with more maturity. I must admit it would be very interesting to hear what he was working on, that, as he intimated, was so radically different. He'd been saying he was going to release some new music for years. However, he is also the guardian of the Zeppelin legacy. As things stand, LZ went out in a blaze of glory after the 2007 concert. Jimmy Page is now 76 years old. Any new music or project involving Jimmy Page especially, would have to be exceptional because the LZ legacy is of an exceptional band. I doubt Jimmy wishes to risk tampering with that legacy."},{"prompt":"Why do planes sometimes leave a vapour trail behind them and sometimes not?","completion":"The water vapour and sulphur particles from engine nozzle get condensed.

Besides this, there are also province-wide Chinese restaurant chains such as Din Tai Fung (Taiwanese-origin) and a few others, not many. When I was in Guangdong Province, I popped by a local-food restaurant chain called, “Real Kung Fu” - that featured a signboard showing a stylized image of the late Bruce Lee (the restaurant was subsequently taken to court in China by the Lee family members but lost the case as the defendant’s claimed that it wasn’t Bruce Lee depicted but a graphic image of a martial art exponent). The domestic fast-food chain (真功夫, zhen gongfu in Mandarin) may not use a literal image of Bruce Lee as part of it’s brand, but it’s hard not to associate the company with the legendary martial artist. Is it Bruce Lee or not? The ‘Real Kung Fu’ chain, based in the south China city of Guangzhou operates as many as 300-plus restaurants across China; they feature large, black and white murals of a man who bears a strong, albeit blurry, resemblance to the late Mr. Lee. Large mural adorn the interior of the restaurant depicting a kung fu figher, not Bruce Lee … LOL!! The food is perhaps a bit more authentic (by fast food standards) with a Cantonese twist. On the menu: steamed chicken and mushrooms, egg custard with preserved pork and fish ball noodle soup. The taste of RKF food is tolerable; they need to be better presented, fresher! Someone posted that the fast-food business is a science and implied that Chinese food cannot have the consistency because of the countless variations to cook a same dish. I’d say it is the management and administration of the fast-food business that is science and the Americans in particular are the masters at it. The vast range of traditional Chinese food is varied, and as such, offer real opportunities in the fast-food segment. If anyone can do it, the Chinese certainly can. But, the food has to be transformed from the traditional to the trendy in synch with the times."},{"prompt":"What are the steps in writing a dissertation?","completion":"Achieving a first class mark on a dissertation is slightly more difficult than it is for shorter assignments. This is simply due to the complexity of the dissertation compared to most types of coursework. However, the greater length of time that students have to complete a dissertation means that a First Class is definitely achievable. With some attention to the following details you can increase your chances of moving to a First. Be Innovative You can set yourself up for earning a first by developing an original and innovative research plan from the start. The best dissertations demonstrate creative, independent thinking. Remember that the dissertation is often viewed as a starting point to a more advanced research career, so proving your ability for original thinking is a great way to show your potential to examiners. Be Critical The difference between a dissertation and a [LINKED_TEXT: best dissertation writing] [URL: https://www.premiumdissertation.co.uk/] is often the degree of critical thinking that it demonstrates. You should show an ability to think beyond common knowledge, and deduce conclusions through insightful and analytical applications of theory. Although this may seem challenging, it is a skill that you will naturally develop from wide reading of journal articles in your field. You can also enhance your ability for critical writing by discussing your ideas in seminars and conferences. Create a Complex Argument – One of the best ways to convey your critical thinking abilities is by creating a complex but coherent argument. This involves combining multiple strands of established ideas to develop a highly specific analytical framework. You should be able to clearly define your overarching philosophy and methodology, and consider how this relates to various theoretical trends in your field. You should avoid convoluted arguments that include too many different ideas; instead choose two or three complementary approaches and combine them to create a unique viewpoint on your subject. Use Obscure Source Material A good way to impress examiners with a first class dissertation is to locate and make use of relatively unknown source material. This can take the form of primary sources obtained from historical archives and research laboratories, or lesser-used secondary sources that you might secure through interlibrary loans. Using these materials will demonstrate your dedication to your research and your ability to judge the value of comparatively obscure sources."},{"prompt":"What facts about Mumbai would people not believe unless they come to Mumbai?","completion":"I would meet her everyday, outside the preschool. We would talk, gossip, chat about our kids and their interests. She was a fun loving woman and we became close. One day, I told her to come over at my place for tea. It was a pleasant surprise when she accepted it, because people here in Mumbai find it weird to visit a stranger's house. Being from Gujarat, this was the most basic thing for me. Yet a cultural shock in Mumbai. Anyway, she came home and I gave her some tea and she was in awe, looking around my house. “What happened?” I asked her. “You have a big house.” “Thank you!” “I stay with my in laws and everyone in a 1bhk. Living alone in a big house is a dream.” “Oh. How many members do you stay with? She started counting and said, “10 People.” I looked at her open mouthed. “10 people in a 1 bhk? How do you guys even manage?” “Yes. My in laws sleep in the hall. My elder brother-in-law and his family sleep in the bedroom. My younger brother-in-law who is unmarried sleeps in the passageway and my husband and I with our son sleep in the kitchen.” “Don't mind, but at least five of you are earning, why not move to a bigger house?” I asked confused. “We can't. My in-laws are very sentimental about this house and we aren't allowed to find another place for ourselves too. We tried telling them it's getting difficult but they don't listen. If any of us, the daughter-in-laws complain, we get an earful on how people in olden days adjusted without complaining. Plus financially this suits us. With the skyrocketing real estate prices, this feels sensible.” I looked at her open mouthed. “Now my in-laws are looking for a bride for my younger brother-in-law. Things are going to get problematic. But we can't say anything. This is how people live in Mumbai. It's natural.” “But how can 11 people stay in a 1bhk?” I asked flabbergasted. “You aren't from Mumbai that's why the shock.” She laughed. “Here in the chawls, an apartment consists of a hall and a kitchen with toilet outside. I have seen 8 to 10 people staying in that small place too.” “I knew about the chawls but not the amount of people who stay in it!” She smiled. “Welcome to Mumbai.” Being the curious weirdo that I am I decided to ask a question which threw her in fits of laughter. “Where do you guys do it? In the hotel rooms?” After she stopped laughing, she replied, “Yes sometimes. We also wait for the kids to sleep.” I smiled. “We take more vacations than normal couples. We love the privacy we get there. Sometimes when my husband's bachelor friends go out of town he gets their apartment keys and we lie at home and stay there for a day or two.” “So much for some intimacy!” I remarked. “Yes. But it's also embarrassing. I can't make noises. We need to be quiet in the whole act. Sometimes it gets on the nerves. I remember when I got married, I would sleep with my husband on the other side of the hall a few feet away from my in-laws. It was very awkward. If they found his hand over me when they got to in the morning we would get a lecture on decency. So it was an irony when she demanded a grandchild soon. Thank goodness my husband had the courage to tell them we need our space to give them a grandchild.” She laughed. I joined her too, in total disbelief. “You know Shefali, you were the first person who understood this issue and asked me about it. Otherwise it's like nobody wants to talk about it. It's a disgrace. It's against our tradition. It's an indecent thing to talk about.” I saluted her. An intercourse, huh sorry, I mean an interesting fact about Mumbai that people will not believe till they come to Mumbai!"},{"prompt":"When is the best time to format? Is it during composition, after composition, or a combination of during and after?","completion":"Initially, it’d be after. The whole point of a 1st draft is to get your thoughts and ideas on paper.

One must also have a method for mapping the input data to a valid system state within the CA. How do you find a CA which after an arbitrary number of iterations, leads to a system state which matches the bit pattern of the data you want to compress? There are also a plethora of types of CAs, each with it’s own often large set of possible rules. It’s a very tricky, but also very interesting problem set, given it’s complexity, scope, and the fact that cellular automata present a non-standard system of computation altogether.

First of all, books are boon if one tries to get it hard. And marrow notes are something that gives you a way how to put all your knowledge and effort in right direction. So, basically make books as a primary source in your initial years. Study them well, make perfect notes then go to marrow videos and make notes from there too. After doing all stuffs just combine whole knowledge as one and read, learn and revise it . Then move to marrow Q banks as after all this understandings of whole theory mcqs will lead you to know specific points on which you have to focus alot. Practice more mcqs and revise all notes over and over again. So, if you can purchase go ahead it's totally your choice but if you can't afford or you don't think you need then straight away head on to book and read it thoroughly . Because initial years are learning years so consume it wisely, you have a lot of time.

At a time when hand washes were unavoidable, a time when the pandemic hit us handwash liquid was probably the trending talk besides sanitiser. Every advertisement and every public communication during the pandemic pointed towards the use of handwashes at regular intervals to maintain hygiene. However, as we are slowly returning back to our new normal, it is vital to retain practices that help you maintain health. Washing hands every now and then is one such practice. While we look at hand washes for daily use, it is also essential to buy [LINKED_TEXT: hand wash] [URL: https://www.dhathriayurveda.in/shop/category/bath-body/hand-wash/] which is natural and safe on hands. Natural hand washes are a great way to clean your hands, and they can also be used as a first step in the process of washing your face. These products provide natural ingredients that make it easier to remove oil and dirt from the skin. Read on as we explore the benefits of natural hand washes: 1. Free from toxic chemicals If a product contains these types of ingredients, it shouldn’t be your ideal go-to product. There’s no telling what might happen if we don’t keep ourselves protected from those harmful substances. It is safe to use [LINKED_TEXT: hand wash liquids] [URL: https://www.dhathriayurveda.in/shop/category/bath-body/hand-wash/] with natural ingredients, the ones that soothe hands and keep them moisturized, rather than the ones that leave your hands dry after use. Ayurvedic and natural hand washes are better than others because they’re more herbal and less likely to cause negative side effects like allergies or irritations after prolonged use. 3. No synthetic colors or fragrances: Natural ingredients are better for your health, the environment and the economy. They’re also more sustainable to produce than synthetic alternatives. Synthetic products often have toxic chemicals in them that can pose a danger to humans, animals and even plants if they’re not disposed of properly after use (such as in landfill sites). Natural products don’t contain such harmful substances so you’ll be helping protect the planet while you wash with them 4. Suitable for sensitive skin Natural [LINKED_TEXT: hand wash ] [URL: https://www.dhathriayurveda.in/shop/category/bath-body/hand-wash/]can be a great option for those with sensitive skin. Many people have sensitive skin, which means that their hands tend to be more prone to irritation and redness than the average person’s. Natural hand wash liquids are typically milder than regular liquid detergents and gel cleansers because they do not contain any harmful chemicals that can cause irritation to your skin. In addition, many natural soaps contain moisturizers that keep your hands soft and smooth after washing them with a gentle soap like this one from Earthly Bodycare! [LINKED_TEXT: Natural hand wash] [URL: https://www.dhathriayurveda.in/shop/category/bath-body/hand-wash/] is better for your health than regular hand wash. Natural hand wash has been shown to be gentler on the skin and less drying, so it’s a great choice if you have sensitive skin or suffer from eczema. It also doesn’t contain any artificial ingredients like other types of cleaning products do, which can cause irritation and inflammation in some people’s bodies. However, some studies suggest that natural soaps may not be as effective at removing dirt as synthetic ones are — so if you’re looking for something that will get rid of all traces of grime from your hands in one fell swoop (or just want to avoid being too harsh), go ahead and use regular soap instead! There are many benefits of using natural hand wash. It is the best option for your skin health and also for the safety of the environment. It does not contain any harmful chemicals that could potentially cause harm to your health.

For any practicing web designer, doing this is probably one of the most humbling experiences you can have; it will change how you think about users. Give a user a task, such as to find something, and watch them try to complete it. You’ll watch that user skip over clues you thought were obvious, click on links they shouldn’t, get lost in the site, and get frustrated. I’ve even watched users cry and blame themselves for failing. Its not their fault; you won’t realize it until you test but most websites are designed like obstacle courses. Each decision a user confronts is like another hurdle; another opportunity to fall on your face, or in a pit, or worse. Evaluating your website’s usability can give you a playbook to improve conversion rates, user success rate (for finding what they wanted to find), and the general impression users take of your brand when they use your site."},{"prompt":"w can you get a verified NFT Twitter profile picture?","completion":"Verified NFT Twitter Profile Picture: To get verified NFT Twitter profile picture, you have to connect your NFT to your Twitter profile.

Started on Coronado Island and when I was 10 moved to OC. CA was the perfect life to me. Warm/hot weather, great beaches, pool in the backyard, orange trees everywhere. When I was in my 30’s I realized something was different. Most if it was still there but had been consumed by traffic, malls, overpopulation, more malls, more freeways, over crowded beaches, crime, more malls, they orange orchards were gone. I knew I needed to make a change but it was very hard to give up the wonderful area I grew up in. Then, one day I quit my corporate job, loaded up my Jeep and a small utility trailer and moved to Washington state. It was the right thing at the time. What do I miss most?. Great beaches with great surf, putting my feet in hot sand, the weather, sounds of crickets at night, the smell of night blooming jasmine, sitting by the pool at night when the temp is still 90deg at midnight, convertibles, being able to be in snow in the morning and in salt water in the afternoon.

It manifests in those Palestinians who are trying to live their lives as normal and trying to make an impression on the Israeli authorities as hard workers whilst having to deal with other Palestinians who abuse the same privileges and make it harder for them. They don't feel a need for a Palestinian state which would ruin everything, they'd rather work on an eventual trust between them as individuals and Israelis and possibly be able to get rid of the security restrictions they're stuck with. But they're prevented from doing that both by Palestinian nationalists and the authorities. The incentive to keep whining about past mistakes and scapegoating the Jews comes from Palestinian nationalists whose entire collective essence is built on murdering Jews, and their leadership whose only way to increase their power and whatever money is being poured into their pockets is to rile people up about this whole thing, both locally and globally. Unfortunately, it seems like these Palestinian terrorist supporters are the majority of the population."},{"prompt":"Why are Tempurpedic beds so expensive?","completion":"Zinus Mattresses: Your Key to a Serene and Restful Home Haven Are you in search of the perfect mattress that combines comfort, support, and eco-friendliness?

But it doesn’t involve any easily weaponized material. It’s true that thorium reactors are inherently “breeder” reactors, and that causes confusion allowing some people to compare them to reactors that can breed plutonium from uranium. But the isotope of uranium bred by thorium reactors is too light to produce significant amounts of plutonium by further breeding, and the 233 isotope of uranium is far too radioactive for make separating any plutonium that may occur by excess breeding remotely feasible. At a larger scale, all nuclear reactors suffer this same popular confusion with Chernobyl and Fukushima. Once you say “nuclear reactor”, the discussion of relative merits is over for 99% of the population, all nukes are world destroying abominations in their view. Adding the term “breeder” in front doesn’t help. Of the tiny percentage of the population that is open to the ins and outs of nuclear power, a reactor that allows them to either produce plutonium or enriched uranium that could be further enriched to weapons-grade material is a major plus, one that is notably absent from the thorium reactor. While those who want nuclear reactors mainly for the production of weapons grade material are not really in the majority, they do form the most powerful and influential lobby in favor of nuclear power. So a reactor that doesn’t provide any feasible hope of obtaining weapons grade material by operating it has already lost over half the political support it might have for being a nuclear reactor, while not losing any of the massive political opposition which is based firmly on complete ignorance. So while a thorium reactor is technically superior in most ways, it is not less expensive to build and operate cause the main cost of nuclear reactors is overcoming political opposition, and they don’t have as much backing to overcome that, precisely because of how much inherently safer they are."},{"prompt":"What is the best way for preparing for GATE CSE?","completion":"Here are a few guidelines: • Visit GATEFLIX for the best online coaching for gate • Download the GATE CSE syllabus and previous exam papers • It’s time to be the best player in the game.

If that’s the case, you need to know all involved in dating an older man because it’s quite different from dating someone your age or younger. Dating an older man comes with its own packages, and it is crucial to know the red flags to look out for when dating an older man to avoid walking into or staying in unhealthy and toxic situations. The following are clear red flags when dating an older man that you shouldn’t ignore. [LINKED_TEXT: Learn More:] [URL: https://ubselfcareandfamilygrowth.blogspot.com/2023/04/12-red-flags-when-dating-older-man.html] On [LINKED_TEXT: ubselfcareandfamilygrowth] [URL: https://ubselfcareandfamilygrowth.blogspot.com/2023/04/12-red-flags-when-dating-older-man.html] 12 Red Flags When Dating An Older Man 1. He Finds It Difficult To Apologize For Wrongs No one is above mistakes, and apologizing to your partner when you feel you have offended them shouldn’t be such a big deal. When he finds it difficult to admit guilt or ask for forgiveness but instead keeps stating reasons why he is correct, that’s a red flag. You don’t want to be in a relationship where you constantly beg for forgiveness or apologize for his wrongs. This might be because he thinks he knows better because he’s been around much longer than you have. So he thinks he can never be wrong, so you have to listen to him and swallow whatever he says, hook, line, and sinker. 2. He Doesn’t Accept Change Change is a constant part of life, and whether you are in a relationship or not, you need to understand that life is always changing, and so are we. If your older partner isn’t open to new experiences but rather prefers to stick with his same old pattern and behavior even when you’ve tried to make him understand and embrace positive change, then you probably need to have a rethink. If he refuses to acknowledge that people evolve and fails to see the need for growth in the relationship, you don’t want to be stuck with such a partner. Most times, older men might disapprove of change because they are already comfortable with their life, and any change to that might seem like a disruption. But a man who loves you and isn’t proud should be open to seeing life from your perspective as long as it isn’t negative or harmful. 3. He Conceals Vital Information Withholding vital information is a clear red flag that he isn’t committed to the relationship.

Presuming they have a good relationship, as the question suggests, he can absolutely ask her to carry it to birth. He should make his wishes / feelings / thoughts known. Respectfully, with the understanding it is her choice. Now flip it… I also believe if the man wants an abortion.. scratch that, that's not relevant, or applicable … if he says he has no desire to be involved or support the child, he should communicate that too. And I tend to believe that such notice could, if local laws agree, protect him from any/most responsibility (liability/legal) of the child. Basically, he shouldn't (no one should) be locked into an 18 year (legal) commitment without some say or opportunity to give due notice, acceptance or agreement. Probably marriage aside, applicable to unmarried folk. Yeah, I know… it's controversial. But I think it's fair and equal. With proper and legal due notice. Also only applicable if abortion is legally available. If not, both people are locked in, equally, obviously. Heck, if the state forces birth, I think they have more responsibility. And it's unconstitutional and wholly wrong to criminally prohibit travel to another jurisdiction that allows abortion, for that purpose. For any purpose, any travel within the US. It's wrong to force a woman to carry an unwanted pregnancy, period."},{"prompt":"Was Duchess Satine a good ruler?","completion":"I think we have to understand one thing. Satine had implemented a fairly peaceful and neutral system. Mandalore pretty much prospered under her rule. The biggest problem though—that many saw as her weakness—was Death Watch. The only reason she failed at the end was because of this faction. They partnered with two of the most deadly beings in the galaxy. They had a whole “army” consisting of criminals to do the job. Maul and Pre-Vizsla took advantage of Mandalore’s current status and took over at the perfect time you could say. Without a proper army to defend Mandalore, Satine and her planet was pretty much helpless and thus, taken over by Death Watch. Depending on which time period you’re talking about, Satine was both a good a leader and possibly a stubborn one too. She didn’t want to use violence even when she was being attacked, so that showed why she failed."},{"prompt":"World War II, why did Stalin order that Moscow buildings be burned down, despite the freezing Russian winter?","completion":"Wrong War.

The crankshaft was bolted to the airframe. The ENTIRE ENGINE of the Rhône, cylinders and all, did the rotation. This did the cooling air flow. The air cooled radial was less likely to be stopped by battle damage because it did not use water cooling. These radials were first designed by the French who fielded some of the finest WW1 aircraft. They evolved into fixed cylinders that did not rotate because when the entire engine rotated gyroscopic effects affected aircraft control ability. With radial engines you had more space in the nose for accessories. Also they were compact as spares on aircraft carriers. A shorter nose was optimal too. Exclude the Cosair but it filled up the space behind the engine. A cannon shell could blow a hole in a jug and often they still flew home.

Pancreas is at the back of all the guts; in front of the spine; surrounded by many and very big blood vessels; total removal of pancreas is one of the most major operations in all of surgery - heart transplant is sort of joy comparing to this - I believe that the name is Whipple’s after the author and the horrors of trying to implant a pancreas from a donnor to a recipient are huge - though some people tried to remove just the beta cells and implant them somewhere.

I don't know if my mother planned ahead of time to do that, or just came up with it at that exact moment, but it worked. I was so sick that it turned me off cigarettes for good.

While animals do exhibit complex social behaviors and engage in cooperative interactions, they do not have the capacity for the kind of abstract thinking and intentional secrecy that would be required for a secret society to exist. That being said, some animal species do exhibit behaviors that could be interpreted as secretive or exclusive. For example, certain primates have been observed engaging in grooming behaviors that are only performed within specific social groups, and some birds have been observed using specific vocalizations or plumage displays to signal membership within certain groups. However, these behaviors are not indicative of intentional secrecy or an organized society in the way that humans would understand it. While animals do not have secret societies in the same way that humans do, many species exhibit complex social behaviors and engage in cooperative interactions with members of their own species. These behaviors are often driven by the need to survive and reproduce, and can be crucial for the success of the individual and the group. For example, many social animals such as primates, elephants, and certain species of birds and insects, form complex social hierarchies and engage in cooperative behaviors such as grooming, sharing food, and protecting one another from predators. These behaviors are often guided by complex social rules and norms, which can vary depending on the species and the specific social group. Some animal species also exhibit behaviors that could be considered exclusive or secretive. For example, certain species of birds form mating pairs that are highly exclusive, and may defend their territory and mating pair bond aggressively against intruders. Other animals, such as certain species of ants and bees, have highly organized societies with specialized roles and tasks for different members of the colony. In addition to the examples mentioned above, there are many other instances of complex social behaviors and cooperation in the animal kingdom. For example, many mammal species, including wolves, dolphins, and elephants, exhibit strong family bonds and engage in cooperative parenting behaviors to raise their offspring. Some animal species also engage in collective decision-making, where individuals work together to make decisions that benefit the group as a whole. For example, honeybees use a complex system of \\"waggle dances\\" to communicate the location of food sources to other members of the colony, and some species of primates engage in vocal signaling to coordinate group movements and avoid predators. While these behaviors are not indicative of secret societies in the way that humans understand them, they do demonstrate the complex social structures and behaviors that exist within the animal kingdom. These behaviors are often driven by evolutionary pressures such as predation, resource scarcity, and reproductive success, and are crucial for the survival and success of individual animals and their social groups. Another interesting aspect of animal social behavior is the development of cultural traditions within groups of animals. Like humans, some animal species have been observed exhibiting behaviors and practices that are specific to their social group or population, and that are transmitted from one generation to the next through social learning. For example, certain groups of chimpanzees have been observed using tools in unique ways, such as using sticks to extract termites from their nests or using rocks to crack open nuts. Similarly, some populations of orcas have been observed exhibiting unique hunting strategies, such as beaching themselves on shore to catch seals. These cultural traditions can be thought of as a kind of \\"animal culture\\", where different social groups develop their own unique practices and behaviors that are passed down through generations. This kind of cultural transmission is thought to be important for animal adaptation and survival, as it allows groups to develop specialized strategies and behaviors that are specific to their local environments and resources. While animals do not have secret societies in the same way that humans do, they do exhibit a wide range of complex social behaviors and interactions that are shaped by evolutionary pressures and that are crucial for their survival and success as individuals and as social groups. It's important to note that these behaviors are not indicative of intentional secrecy or an organized society in the same way that humans would understand it. Rather, they are driven by complex social and biological factors that have evolved over time to help animals survive and thrive in their environments."},{"prompt":"w does one get officially married if they don’t believe in God?

First thing we had to do is to get technology to progress to a point where we can see a lot of pixels on-screen. Next, it was 3D imagery. Next it was special effects (everything from light sourcing, to anti-aliasing, to particle effects). Next, it was trying to take a traditional game into open world, and that’s still happening. We’re now at a point where graphics are getting better every year. Few things I see missing is progression in: World size, physics, and environmental communique - buidling destruction, bullet penetration (“Black” but with holes. Battlefield explored this a few times in the franchise.), and more. Try doing this with 4k, and 60fps. On console? That’s near impossible. So, PS5, or Xbox Next better up their game - none of this checkerboarding bullshit. Once we get past 4k fidelity, and the next big one is going to be 8k, and quantum pixels. It’s already out, but they’re expensive. And likewise they take up a lot of processing power to do better graphics.

In the millions of years of evolution, the Felines chose size, stealth and strength while the Canids chose numbers, intelligence, agility and stamina. Their hunting methods are completely different from each other, big cats prefer to sneak up on their prey and finish the job silently, this requires large size, paws, strength to wrestle with large preys and a deadly bite. Wild canids on the other hand charge straight at the herd, in the chaos that ensues, they pick out the weaklings in the herd and keep chasing them until the prey is exhausted, no matter how far the prey runs, they will hunt it down with their sense of smell and stamina that allows them to run for hours. Their hunting method also involves cornering the prey and harassing it by biting it from different sides until the prey is exhausted and then devour it alive. This method is brutal but the canids have no choice, their bite force is not as strong as that of big cats so they cannot deliver a killing blow. There is also an ever-present threat of other large predator like tigers, lions, bears, spotted hyenas or other packs taking advantage of the situation and stealing their food so they finish it as soon as possible. There are exceptions of course, for example lions live in groups called ‘Prides’ while Cheetahs sometimes live in coalitions. In my opinion, this is because they live in a very harsh environment with multiple apex predators competing with each other like the Spotted Hyenas and the African wild dogs who are said to be the most successful hunters in the world alongside the Asiatic/Indian wild dogs or ‘Dholes’. However they still are not as successful as the canids when it comes to pack behaviour and hunting success rate. Now there are large canids out there in the wild that grow to enormous sizes like the Northern European wolves and the Timber wolves which are currently the largest living wolf species in the world, they can weigh anywhere between 18 kilograms to 79 kilograms. However, these guys are still much smaller than even one of the smallest big cats - the leopard which can weigh between 65 kilograms on average and 85 kilograms at maximum. The dire wolves which went extinct around 35,000 years ago were 25% larger than the modern day timber wolves, which is still less than the weight of a large cougar. Cougars are considered honourary big cats. The largest wild dog ever discovered was the Epicyon Haydeni These monstrous bone-crushers could weigh up to 180 kilograms and wreaked havoc in North America around 2 Million years ago. These beasts might be too much for modern day wildlife, but back then a lot of monsters existed. The big cats were also much larger than their modern day cousins, for example,The most popular Smilodon Populator The American Lion The Ngandong Tiger All these cats could very well weigh up to 400 kilograms, so they still outweighed the largest canids. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the record for largest tiger ever held in captivity goes to a male Siberian tiger named Jaipur. Owned by American animal trainer Joan Byron Marasek, Jaipur measured much larger than almost any other tiger ever record. By the time he was nine years old, he measured 10 feet, 11 inches long, and weighed closed to 422 kilograms. Meanwhile, the largest tiger ever found in the wild was an overgrown male Bengal tiger. This giant specimen lived in Uttar Pradesh in India prior to being shot by hunters in November 1967. At full length, he measured nearly 10 feet, 7 inches long, and weighed close to 390 kilograms. There are dog breeds that can grow to gigantic sizes but that’s because of thousands of years of selective breeding. For example, the largest dog breed in the world was the Alpine Mastiff which could weigh up to 168 kilograms, however this breed has not been bred for almost two hundred years because such a huge size caused a lot of health issues. If you leave a group of large dog breeds in the wild, they will adapt and gradually shrink in size with each generation and will start looking like this Or this Dogs aren’t meant to be large, they are meant to be small, intelligent, coordinating and enduring."},{"prompt":"What are the best wireless earphones under Rs 5,000?","completion":"Hi… try this headphone I have tried and it's very good [LINKED_TEXT: Amazon.in] [URL: http://amazon.in/]: Electronics ([LINKED_TEXT: Amazon.in: Electronics] [URL: https://amzn.to/3q1KCE7])"},{"prompt":"What is keeping commercial spaceflight from being readily available to the public?","completion":"Cost per flight."},{"prompt":"What was your reason for leaving a tremendous tip at a restaurant?","completion":"When I get good service I try to leave a good tip up to 100% of meal if I can afford it.

Not all glass bowls are suitable for baking at high temperatures. Look for bowls labeled as oven-safe or heat-resistant.Preparation: Grease and flour the glass bowl to prevent the cake from sticking to the sides. You can also use parchment paper to line the bottom of the bowl for easier cake removal.Temperature: Glass conducts heat differently than metal pans. Reduce the oven temperature by about 25°F (around 14°C) from what the recipe suggests. This helps prevent the cake from browning too quickly or potentially cracking due to sudden temperature changes.Cooking Time: Glass bowls may take a little longer to heat up and distribute heat evenly. Monitor the cake closely and adjust the baking time as needed. Use a toothpick or cake tester to check for doneness; it should come out clean when inserted into the center of the cake.Avoid Sudden Temperature Changes: Glass can be more susceptible to thermal shock, so avoid placing a cold glass bowl directly into a preheated oven or transferring it from the oven to a cold surface. Allow it to cool gradually.Size and Shape: Keep in mind that the shape and size of the glass bowl will affect how the cake bakes. Thicker glass may take longer to heat up, while a deeper bowl might require adjustments to the baking time.Handling: Glass bowls retain heat for longer, so use oven mitts or pot holders when handling the bowl, both when placing it in the oven and when taking it out. Always refer to the cake recipe for guidance and adjust accordingly when using a glass bowl. If you're unsure, you can always use a traditional metal or silicone cake pan to ensure consistent results."},{"prompt":"My partner of one month doesn’t like my therapy dog of 10 years.

Take the mid-’60s Mustangs as an example. These cars caused a sensation when they were first brought on the market and they sold faster than dealers could keep them in their showrooms. Why change a good thing and morph it into a bloated, overstyled version of itself? This is all the car I’d ever need. It’s not perfect, but it is awesome. I pondered the question for a bit, then I thought about it some more. An answer eventually came to me. Companies don’t just keep making old popular cars because by a certain point, every buyer that wants one and can afford one has already acquired it. It’s the old supply and demand equation. With the example of the old Mustangs in the 60s, supply eventually met the demand for available models. Ford Motor Company had to create the latest and greatest models to generate new demand. Once in a while terrible things happen in the automotive world because of this evolution. Take the Ford Thunderbird for example. This is a 1956 Thunderbird. Beautiful car. A real classic. Why mess with this? The beige car in front here is a 1980 Ford Thunderbird. Sad. Ugly. Pathetically underpowered. Evolution isn’t supposed to work this way. After a while, everything comes full circle. The Shelby Mustang was a popular old car. The GT 500 CR you are looking at is a new car built to look like an old car. Each one is hand-assembled.

Are private schools better than public schools?","completion":"It is unfortunate, but true, that private schools cater to the wealthy. The less well to do are not considered. Then too private schools are not Required to accept just anyone. If a child has a “discipline problem\\" or is falling behind, has a medical issue, or is the “wrong\\" race. The school can not accept them or throw them out. Two examples. A local doctor was told his children were not allowed to attend the local private schools. He is black.. granted, this was the late 60s…but… secondly private schools are often not REQUIRED to employ teachers certified and licenced by the state. One school my daughter's attended had a teacher with no educational training at all. Wonderful woman. . but not trained or licenced by the state. She ended up as the principal. But this meant that the school did not have to pay teachers as well as the public schools did. By virtue of the fact that the parents were well off, and had paid a lot to have their child attend, the parents were involved in the school. This helps. And because the school can pick and choose students, they can discard those that do not “contribute to big quality learning\\" by sending them to public schools. Plus many have leisure time to be available to the school when asked. This is not the case in public school. I can tell you horror stories about students in a poor section of the town I lived in as well as my daughter's experiences teaching there. Are private schools “better\\"? Yeah.. in the way that a Rolls Royce is “better\\" than a Chevy. One of the points that i have against school vouchers is just that.. should people with low income be given a voucher for a rolls royce? What would be the result?

Imagine cities that function like well-orchestrated symphonies, where transportation systems operate on advanced dynamical models, minimizing congestion and environmental impact. AI systems, fuelled by deep learning algorithms, manage civic infrastructure, continually adapting to emerging patterns and needs. Personalized healthcare becomes the norm, with predictive models offering personalized treatments based on an individual's genetic makeup, lifestyle, and real-time biometrics. Finance would also see a paradigm shift, with risk models that adapt to global economic fluctuations, capable of predicting and mitigating financial crises. Education, powered by interactive and adaptive learning platforms, allows for personalized learning experiences, breaking the barriers of geography and socio-economic status. Perhaps, most intriguingly, the integration of quantum computing and AI models could lead to breakthroughs in understanding and manipulating the fabric of reality itself. The ethical implications of such a world will be as complex and multifaceted as the technologies driving them, requiring ongoing dialogue and careful stewardship. The union of human creativity with advanced mathematical models and computational power could usher in an era of unprecedented innovation, prosperity, and interconnectedness, while also posing new challenges and ethical dilemmas that will require wisdom and foresight to navigate. This future, while optimistic, is not without its challenges. It presupposes a trajectory of technological development that prioritizes the common good and human well-being, rather than reinforcing existing inequities or leading to unforeseen negative consequences. The realization of such a future would likely depend on a combination of technological innovation, political will, ethical considerations, and perhaps even a bit of luck."},{"prompt":"My son gets a slip home every day from his teacher that needs to be signed because he gets in trouble.

Definitely with Fallout 3 I felt overwhelmed being kicked out of the vault and just having essentially a whole map open. This is probably why the original GTA games split the areas into gradually unlockable islands, this is common in a lot of other open worlds or metroidvanias. A very interesting example of this conundrum is GTA San Andreas vs GTA IV. GTA SA had a revolutionarily huge map, something like FIVE TIMES the city of GTA 3 I think. However, afterwards the developers said it was almost too realistic in how huge it is and this lead to a lot of dead areas you could get stuck and bored in like the redwood forests and vast open deserts. I think this is the reason there are so many damn roads so you can always be close to a car to jack. It may not look that big on paper but it feels HUUUUUUUUUUUGE. With GTA IV they went back to a smaller denser map and focused more on things like enterable buildings than overall huge size, and it worked based on most people’s reactions. IMO you should always have a variety of open empty areas and dense, city areas, and everything in between, which it looks like GTA SA did well. I mean the country hick no where areas and open deserts don’t make a lot of sense being so close to each other, but they were my favorite areas to run about. So there’s a bit of a divide perhaps on quality vs. quantity of area. on the extreme end of quantity over quality you have procedurally generated games like No Man’s Sky (meaning it was essentially randomly generated). These are meant to be so huge you could literally never run out of things to dsicover (it’s like a full planet dense galaxy TO SCALE) but, it all starts to blur together. Really this becomes first and foremost about exploration, and the story isn’t until like 50 hours in or something. Personally I say an open world game can never be too big as long it fits with the objective of gameplay. If you want a tight, narrative experience, best to kept it small and dense, if you want more explorative/resource harvesting gameplay, go big. At the same time, it is better a map be too small than stretched thin and become boring, empty and/or repeitive."},{"prompt":"Whats the craziest thing that's happened to you at work?","completion":"A few years back, I was working in a small independent cinema in my city. It was a quiet evening, with maybe two out of 9 screens fully booked. The box office was on a separate floor to the screens and concessions - I had been working on the floor on this evening. At around 9 PM, which was our busiest period, we started to receive reports of people at the box office level, including staff at the till and customers, suddenly just starting to cough, with burning sensations in their eyes. Slowly people at the concessions area on the level above started to have similar complaints. At this point, management decided to declare an emergency and required staff to evacuate the premises - the first time this has ever been called. The box office and the area around the concessions was quarantined and everyone except for staff was brought through the emergency exits. A few minutes later, the emergency services arrived; ambulances for the people who had been affected and the fire brigade who came equipped in full breathing apparatus. Nobody knew what had caused this, but it had been thought that maybe it had been a gas leak of some sort. Once we were certain that everyone had been evacuated, staff were told to go home. It was only the following way that we discovered what had happened: When the firemen had completed their sweep, they were unable to locate the source of the irritant. However, later that evening police arrested two teenage boys at a convenience store a few miles away. It turns out that the boys had managed to find pepper spray that the American military had used. The cinema shared an underground carpark with the retail park it was attached to and had an underground entrance that led to the box office. The boys had been in the carpark and had sprayed the pepper spray through the ventilation system that circulated air through the floor leading to the box office. It had been circulated through the cinema and had been strong enough to impact people at the box office and concessions. The two boys were caught doing the exact same thing at that convenience store and immediately confessed to doing the same at the cinema. I've no idea what happened to the boys, but I'm sure their parents weren't best pleased when they discovered what happened."},{"prompt":"What are N95 masks normally used for?","completion":"The N95 respirator is a face respirator or mask that meets the U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) N95 classification of air filtration.

They help explain the difference between numbers and help towards simplifying equations or solving them. Combinatorics and Number theory. It has been portrayed as the investigation of \\"organized sets of integers rather than arithmetical, scientific, and different areas of number hypothesis, which manage logarithmic relations and non-discrete properties of numbers. a first a part of number theory and analysis, it is now considered to be classified under combinatorics or an independent field. It includes the bijective approach and various tools in analysis and analytic number theory and has relationships with statistical mechanics. Number theory involved different kinds of number i.e Even numbers(2,4,6,8,10,12,14,15….),odd numbers(1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,,,),prime numbers (2,3,5,7,11,13,17,,,,,,) Logic and foundations. The strategies for math are rational, and rationale in this way plays a crucial part in the improvement of math. Reasonable legitimate structures in which math can be directed can accordingly be called slogica foundations for mathematics.Basic Mathematical logics are a negation, conjunction, and disjunction.

Essentially, the Labour Party is a bourgeois / workers' party. It continually attempts to marry the interests of workers with capitalists. This lies at the heart of reformism. Maintain the interests of the capitalist system and capital and then somehow make things better for workers. Ultimately, this is an impossible contradiction, especially in a time of economic downturn. Capitalism must in times of economic slowdown attempt to make workers pay the price. Cut wages to try to restore profit margins, cut services. Just a recent example. The 2008 crisis can in no way be blamed on workers. It was a banking crisis caused by bankers. What was the solution of capitalist Governments across the world? Bail out the banks with State money (basically socialism for the rich) and implement austerity. Today we are facing inflation. Again, workers cannot be blamed, wage increases have been moderate for some time. Now we are hearing that workers have to be careful not to ask for large increases in wages(ie increases in line with inflation) because it will add to inflationary pressures. Now, the Labour Party tries to somehow resolve this contradiction and be loyal to capitalism. So there is and has always been a major left-right wing split in the Labour Party. The left looking to the workers, the right to the capitalists. This is not just some spat but lies at the heart of the Labour Party. Not just that but ultimately, the Labour Party must let down workers and side with the capitalist class. This is because like all reformist parties, it is wedded to the capitalist system. It has not and never can attempt to really challenge capital. It must especially in power in a capitalist parliament, serve the interests of capital. So, we have a party which is perpetually split and in conflict with itself, a party which attempts to appeal to workers but ultimately serves capital and attacks its own natural supporters, a party that often talks one way and acts another, a party that often make promises which it totally fails to deliver and so on. A party at war with itself and attempting to solve an unsolvable contradiction will find it hard to win elections. It can be done especially when the Tories are totally crap, but it is hard."},{"prompt":"it true that Eminem is the 5th member of BLACKPINK?","completion":"Unlike other answers to this question which are either sarcastic or straight to point with no explanation, I’ll actually write a detailed answer that is COMPLETELY true. Here is a timeline of events we can use as evidence to determine if Eminem has joined Blackpink or not. November 2019 In November 2019, there were reports that Blackpink had hired someone new to write their music. It was reported to be a boy of 173cm, medium build and caucasian heritage. This description perfectly matches Eminem. January 28th 2020 In January 2020, an Eminem song was leaked. Within the song, Eminem rapped: “I have 4 Korean bitches on my dick I may as well create some porn Or some babies with small tits Just kidding, these bitches are family now Or so they think” As we all known, Eminem loves to speak his mind and diss whoever he feels like for the sake of it. He most likely didn’t have any malicious intent behind those words and was possibly just having some fun. However, Eminem refused to release this song because he was unaware of how the Korean community and YG would react. March 19th 2020 Around this time, Jisoo from Blackpink was working on her solo. Her rap verse in the song got leaked. She rapped (translated to English): “Yo Eminem be like dissing me Nah nah nah, he may be GOAT but he don't have shit on me Except his mother fuckin’ child is in me Fuck, do I get an abortion?” Soon after the leak, YG announced that this was not actually part of her solo and she was simply freestyling in the same booth that Eminem often uses. Jisoo has since said the rap was a joke and that she and Eminem were just messing around in the booth. Naked. January 2021 YG has confirmed that Eminem has been a part owner and an employee for their company since 2000. He had supposedly invested over 350 million into the company and made over triple back. Using these crucial pieces of evidence, I have determined that Eminem is in fact the 5th member of Blackpink. They have kept it a secret for some reason but it will eventually be released."},{"prompt":"What is the best defence against ransomware?","completion":"There is no single “best” antivirus, as different antivirus software may be better suited for different users.

When using a proxy server the device sends all traffic to the proxy. It forwards the request to the targeted site and downloads the relevant information and brings it back to you. Let's define and understand what a proxy server is generally all about. What is a Proxy server? The proxy server is a computer system that performs as an intermediary in the request made by users. This type of server helps prevent an attacker from attacking the network and serves as a tool used to create a firewall. The etymology of the word proxy means \\"a figure that can be used to represent the value of something\\", this means that a proxy server represents or acts on behalf of the user. The fundamental purpose of proxy servers is to safeguard the direct connection of internet users and resources. All requests made by the users from the internet go to the proxy server. The responses of the request return back to the proxy server for evaluation and then to the user. Proxy servers serve as an intermediary between the local network and the world wide web. Proxy servers are used for several reasons, such as to filter web content, to avert restrictions like parental blocks, to screen downloads and uploads, and to provide privacy when browsing the internet. The proxy server also prevents and protects the identity of the users. There are different types of proxy servers used according to the different purposes of a request made by the clients and users. Proxies provide a valuable layer of security for your network and computers. It can be set up as web filters or firewalls which can protect computers from threats such as malware or ransomware. This extra security is also significant when linked with a secured gateway or attached security products. This way, network administrators can filter traffic according to its level of safety or traffic consumption of the network. How to use a proxy? Some people use proxies for personal purposes however, most of the proxies are used in offices, businesses, or in schools. One good example of a proxy being used for a personal purpose is when a user hides its original location to access more movies online. In a company setup, it can be used to achieve a particular key task such as: Enhance securityProtect the user’s activity on the internet from individuals who are trying to snoop on themProvide quality of service (QoS) for users like balancing internet traffic to prevent network breakdownManage and control the access of users to the websites. How does a Proxy Server operate? An IP address is just like a home address in your neighbourhood. Like snail mail, it determines the addresses in order to deliver the mail. Similarly, the internet knows how to send the data to the correct computer in networking using the IP Address. A proxy server is a computer connected to the internet with an IP address. When you want to access a particular site, you are sending a web request, and these requests go to the proxy server first. This request will be evaluated by the proxy server and the request to the site will be forwarded to the web server on your behalf. When the proxy server forwards your web requests, it will make some changes to the data that you send, but still, get you the contents that you expected to receive. A proxy server will change the IP address so that the web server doesn’t know the exact location. Proxy servers will also encrypt the data. Once the data is encrypted, it will be useless to others but not to the actual recipient of the data. A proxy server uses encryption computation such as AES, or RSA. Once the request is evaluated by the web server, the proxy server collects the response and forwards the web page data on your end through the web browser. A proxy server can block access to particular web pages based on IP address. Why Should You Use a Proxy Server? Control the internet usage of employees Business organisations set up proxy servers to control, manage and monitor employees' usage of the internet. Some companies block a specific website during company time. In order for the employee to become productive, they configure the proxy server to deny or permit access to specific sites. Control the internet usage of children Parents may set up proxy servers to control and monitor kids using the internet. Using proxy servers at home is equally important in offices or companies. Parents can monitor and log all web requests from their children's devices so they know how much time their children spend on internet access. Bandwidth allocation and speed Companies can also get better network performance with a reliable proxy server. Proxy servers can save a copy of the website locally so that every time there is a request on a popular website it will automatically send it to the user. This is very beneficial because thousands of users access a certain website (ex. [LINKED_TEXT: YouTube] [URL: http://youtube.com/]) at the same time. The proxy server doesn’t need to request to the internet since it has requested a copy and cached it locally on the users' machine. This saves a lot of bandwidth and improves the performance of the network. Privacy Either users at home or at the office use a proxy server to browse the internet privately. Proxy server changes the IP address of the host computer and other information needed by the web upon request. This way the destination server doesn’t know who made the actual request. These secure the personal information and browsing habit of an individual. Limited Access Proxy servers allow users to bypass content restrictions enforced by companies or by the government. What if your favourite sites are blocked by the network administrator? The proxy server enables you to choose any place or country that hosts the proxy. Some countries around the world closely censor or restrict access to the internet, and a proxy server enables you to access blocked and uncensored contents. Improved security Proxy servers provide security benefits aside from privacy benefits. Companies or individuals can configure their proxy server to encrypt web requests to keep information from snooping. Using proxy makes it impossible for malware sites to access because they will be filtered. For additional security, the company integrates its proxy server with a Virtual Private Network (VPN). VPN on the other hand works on the OS level while proxies work on the application level. This means that remote users can access the internet through the company proxy.

At the speed with which bullets are fired, which is about 350 m/s for an average bullet, even a round tip bullet can easily penetrate human skin. The goal is to maximize the accuracy, reduce resistance when it's in air and increase the damage caused to the target. These are hollow-point bullets, one of the deadliest one's. They have a small pit at the apex. When this bullet hits a soft target, the pressure in the hollow tip causes the bullet to expand outwards. This is called mushrooming as the resultant bullet looks like one. The greater frontal surface area of the expanded bullet limits its depth of penetration into the target, and causes more extensive tissue damage along the wound path. Military bullets are often pointy, but that's mostly because of aerodynamics (streamline bullets cause less drag than rounded one's). While these bullets are the most aerodynamic, they are also the worst in terms of length, because they have the highest ogive [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #FVFyt] to cylinder ratio. This is not usually a problem for rifles (which is why you will find a lot of pointy ended spitzer type rifle bullets), but it's a bad situation for a handgun, where the length of the bullet massively increases the size of the magazine and chamber for a pistol. It's even worse for revolvers, because they have a huge and heavy metal cylinder (not the same as the bullet cylinder) which holds all rounds.

The reason for this is that I have an actual repository (media server) that has all my multimedia files so networking pcs is easier than networking televisions. Also, my experience with smart televisions is that they tend to be “abandoned” by the manufacturer after a few years and hence their “smart” apps become obsolete and non-functional. Anyway, on one of my smart televisions (an older Sharp LC55N43U65N7), there are multiple USB ports behind the screen. One is clearly marked for HDD/USB flash/external drive. It also looks like a USB3.0 port, being blue and the other ports are “generic” looking black/white USB2.0 ports. Plugging in a wired mouse, a wireless mouse and a wired usb keyboard on ANY of the black ports work. I can navigate browsers and apps with both the keyboard and mouse. Data entry with the keyboard is also possible. I also tried a logitech unifying receiver paired with a K360 keyboard and M705 mouse and both works. I have a cheap “off brand” Westinghouse smart tv where a keyboard or a mouse works, - but strangely not at the same time despite having 2 usb ports. My oldest smart tv is a Toshibra 40 inch that has a USB port. If I plug in a USB drive/external (powered) hard drive, it works. I am able to access and play the files. However, if I plug in a mouse or keyboard, they do not seem to work. Navigation of the smart functions are limited to using the remote. However, like I’ve stated earlier, I do not generally use the smart functions and do not have the mouse and keyboard plugged into the tv as well. I prefer a Logitech K400 plugged into a pc that is connected to the tv. So, a mouse (or keyboard or storage device) may or may not work with ALL smart tvs. This is because of the implementation of the USB class recognition for each brand/model. USB should be “self configuring” but if the manufacturer has not provided the “drivers” for the device, then there might not be a way for the television to run (and recognize) the connected devices. Fortunately, there is little chance of doing any damage by trying to plug in a mouse or keyboard to the tv, so you can always give it a try."},{"prompt":"Why are modern Iranians lighter than ancient Iranians, when both are Persians?","completion":"Climate change"},{"prompt":"w did a plane crash on the upper floors of the World Trade Center result in the entire building collapsing?","completion":"Planes crashed just after take off.Large fuel load ignited/exploded on (or shortly after) impact.That fire burned long and quite high in temperature.Fire proofing/insulation on structural fasteners between floor beam elements and the central building pilar (containing elevators and stairs) was already not 100%, I believe.

It’s impossible to answer as it is. You loaded the question with an illogical statement. When you want to ask an honest question and get honest answers you NEVER LOAD YOUR ASSUMPTION INTO THE QUESTION. Why did you include the first statement? What good did it achieve? What it achieved was allowing you to whine to a bunch of strangers and do this, “Waaah. I like this movie. I’m declaring that it was fun. Waaah. Why don’t people agree with me?” Have you considered the possibility that just like you cannot ask a logical question, your taste in films is kind of shitty too? See, the movie was shit. It wasn’t fun. It was crap. It failed the two tests for “quality” in Hollywood: rave reviews and lots of fans. The answer here is the one you won’t like: the movie was shitty.

I can’t see the problem."},{"prompt":"f there is no atmosphere in space, why is it cold?","completion":"Space isn’t really cold. Asking about the temperature of a near-vacuum is essentially meaningless because the atmosphere carries and transmits very little heat. In space, the only mechanism of heat transfer is radiation. The main source of received heat is the sun - contributions from the Earth are fairly minor. But radiation is also the only way to lose heat. The human body generates approximately 100 watts of heat just from metabolism. If an astronaut’s skin is a black body (maximizing the energy emitted), and has a surface area of 1.8 m^2, then by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: 100 W = 1 * 5.67*10^-8 W/m^2/K^4 * T^4 T = 205 K = -68 *C. So, your equilibrium skin temperature would be very, very cold. An unprotected human in space would freeze to death if the lack of oxygen didn’t kill them first. Fortunately, a space suit must hold in air pressure and provide micrometeoroid protection, so there’s no way to avoid it providing quite a bit of thermal insulation as well. But there’s a problem. That was in the shade. The sun dumps about a kilowatt of energy per square meter onto everything in its path. Your entire 1.8 m^2 surface isn’t facing the sun at once, but it’s still enough to cook you alive since your body’s normal method of cooling down -sweating water onto the skin and letting it take away heat by evaporating - doesn’t work in a sealed spacesuit. In fact, real spacesuits need to actively cool their wearer down, and do so with the use of a layer full of small tubes that water circulates through. Spacesuits are also usually white, which reflects some solar radiation away (but doesn’t significantly impede the ability to radiate away your own generated heat, because white paint is only highly reflective in the visible spectrum, and is actually “dark” in the infrared, where objects at human body temperature radiate most of their heat."},{"prompt":"Can an unmarried couple stay in Coimbatore?","completion":"Depends on your adaptability .

Many sailors were illiterate and knew only rudimentary arithmetic, so they were completely dependent on their captain and other officers, if any, to get them to where they were going."},{"prompt":"What was trench warfare like in World War I?","completion":"Trenches were depressions dug in the ground that soldiers used to seek shelter and fight the enemy in. Not only that, they lived in these holes. Above all else, they had to always avoid the \\"No Man's Land\\" – or the unoccupied area between both parties – if they wanted to ever leave the war alive. Primarily, trenches were composed of mud, rain, and dirt. However, in an attempt to adapt with their surroundings and kill the enemy, soldiers also had to do a significant amount of construction work. Firstly, they built a parapet to support machine guns and a periscope which assisted them in viewing and capturing the adversary. Including that, they also built steps (called duckboards) among the bottom of the land depression so they could walk – or even run – more easily throughout the long pathway. Lastly, they also found it necessary to build a dugout in case the worst – such as massive bombings – occurred. In fact, they would have valuable conversations between generals and soldiers in these dugouts, where electromagnetic frequencies were less likely to be corrupted. – Living Conditions 1 - Mud was a very complicated aspect for the performance of troops. Ever since they set foot on land, trench life involved a never-ending struggle against water and mud. Soldiers would often find themselves falling on each other and unable to shoot their rifles as they slipped over the waterlogged duckboards. Mud was, in its simplest form, a catalyst for simple mistakes; after all, they were all stuck in a question of life or death, and there was simply no time for them to deal with something that was, essentially, a natural aspect of their condition. If they had to sleep in mud, they did exactly that. If shortage was the case and they had to eat mud, they did so too. Truly, all they cared about was winning the war. The mud came second. British novelist John Masters said that there were many \\"blasted trees, feet and twisted hands sticking up out of the earth, bloody shirts, ammunition clips, holes half full of water, each containing two pale, huge eyed men, trying to keep their rifles out of the mud, and over all the heavy, sweet stench of death…” 2 – Rats and lice tormented the troops all day. Oversized rats would roam around the broken duckboards, spreading dangerous diseases that affected the soldier’s kidneys and cardiovascular systems. With the addition of lices, this situation was only worsened. In 1918 doctors identified lice as the sole cause of trench fever, which caused headaches and muscle pain on the soldiers. 3 – Food & Sleep. Even though tons of food was sent in petrol cans or old jam jars – which was carried up by the communication trenches in straw-lined boxes every month – many of them were severely malnourished by the diseases that plagued the soldiers. Even so, thousands of field workers cooked and supplied food to the troops. To be honest, if the soldiers lived for one thing, it was to protect the people back in their respective countries who made sure they were nourished. In his journal, former German soldier Ernst Junger wrote that \\"twice more, I am torn from my sleep to do my duty...at last there's the clatter of the coffee-bringers coming down the communication trench; it's seven o'clock in the morning. The night watch is over.\\" – Disease and Illness 1 – Shell shock. In addition to the hardships soldiers faced in terms of food and animal infestation, they also had to confront the trauma that was imposed on the troops. Many of them were sent home due to the shock that they experienced, deeming many incapable of participating in war ever again. For example, in the Battle of the Somme, a dark veil was sent over the soldiers’ heads, and by 3:30 PM an entire French battalion had been wiped out by German artillery. This loss has been reflected on their behavior ever since. They were never the same again. (Note: this is, of course, not limited to French troops.) 2 – Trench foot. The unsanitary conditions of trench life, like the cold and persistent dampness, resulted in trench foot – a frost-bite-like infection that, in extreme cases, lead soldiers to develop gangrene and eventual amputation procedures. Tight boots, wet conditions, and cold caused deep rashes on the soldiers’ skins. On the other hand, they still had to fight the war, even if this meant that one of their legs would eventually be cut off. 3 – Trench fever. This problem, albeit detrimental to the troops’ performance, was the least of their worries relative to the other disadvantages they faced. Still, they were sick. They coughed, yet no medicine was sent their way – perhaps because there was none. They suffered from painful headaches, sore muscles, weak bones, and broken joints. Most of all, they suffered from the unavailability of a solution. Worst of it all, soldiers infected each other with this fever through a body parasite harboring the causative organism called the Rickettsia. – Attacks 1 – Gas attacks. In addition to the dangers faced within the trenches, soldiers also had to worry about the gruesome possibility of a gas attack. The Germans, for instance, developed their Gummischutzmaske with an activated charcoal filter small enough to be worn on the face. With this in mind, they had to protect themselves by, in its essence, responding to the horrors. Case in point, the American Expeditionary Forces’ methods of deploying gas weapons were mostly premised on wind direction and speed. Most of what they did in terms of poison gas, though, was delivered by artillery and mortar rounds. 2 – Artillery bombardments have been the single most effective, casualty-causing war tactic until now. As soldiers lived in the dirty trenches – amongst many of whom were mentally destabilized by the actuality of conflict – the prospect of mass shelling was always an active one. As they used their Lee-Enfield rifles in the waterlogged field, they also came to realize that their ammunition was scarce, meaning that they couldn’t make a response to every mass attack that was perpetrated against them. Daily Life in the Trenches 5 AM Half an hour before daylight, they would all practice their \\"Stand-to-Arms\\" drill, which is when they alerted each other of any enemy attack. Specifically, they looked through the periscope – which was often times dirty due to smudge – to see if their adversary was ready for combat. At this time of the day, they had to neglect their exhaustion in favor of their most important objective: victory. 6 AM At this time of dawn, they would usually drink rum. Simply enough, they would go through their rum ration – a daily dose of the beverage given to every soldier every day – and define how much they would drink. This prepared them to fight, for it diverged their mind from the traumas that they had – and still were – experiencing. 7 AM This is when they would eat breakfast. Based on the records, they would eat minimal amounts of bacon, and drink even lesser amounts of tea, which they consumed in all its glory. After all, they might have been just glad to have enough food. Noon At about 12 PM, they started cleaning. They cleaned themselves, their weapons, and their clothes. They also made sure to tidy the trench to ensure better communication between soldiers. 5 PM Dinner and tea. Usually, this is when freezing temperatures struck. For that reason, soldiers would go in the dugouts and talk to each other about family, future prospects, and the fear of knowing that they could die at any moment. 6 PM Although they usually differed, many decided that the best time to sleep was at 6 PM, when both parties were retreating from their daily activities. 7 PM As some slept, many would wake up after a nap and work all night on patrols, digging trenches, putting up barbed wire, and getting stores. They replaced the unit of soldiers responsible for these chores every five days. And then they repeated and repeated and repeated. Until, one day, someone raised the white flag. In Flanders fields the poppies blow Between the crosses, row on row, That mark our place; and in the sky The larks, still bravely singing, fly Scarce heard amid the guns below. We are the Dead. Short days ago We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow, Loved and were loved, and now we lie, In Flanders fields.

If you enter the Neutral Zone to attempt to rescue the ship, you pass. If you ignore the distress call or attempt to contact the Klingons, continue on your patrol and obey the law, you pass. Data doesn’t have character, per sé, he was programmed by Dr. Soong to have a sense of self, and a desire to better himself. On his own, Data had a personal desire to become more human. As arguably the apex of technology in the known galaxy (apart from Data’s “mother,” Dr. Juliana Tainer, Season 7 “Inheritance”), wanting to become more human seemed like a step down, or backwards, to some people (the Borg Queen, etc.). For seven seasons of television and 4 movies, this personal quest of Data’s was mined for material. Including in Nemesis, when he sacrificed himself to save his mentor and friend, Captain Picard. If Data is emulating human behavior, compassion and willingness to help those in need, being important parts of the human condition, i believe Data would attempt to rescue the ship.

The every day food offers a wide variety of textures, soft, crispy, crunchy and everything in between.Prominence given to milk and byproducts in cooking. North India rules when it comes to sweets/desserts. Note - my love for NI food is not applicable to kadhi, parwal and khichdi. Pros of South Indian cuisine: We do spices far better than North. Very nuanced spicing too. Spicy food complemented with non-spicy side dishes is a South Indian specialty.When it comes to regular meals, our taste range is better, i.e. spicy, savory and everything in between.We do breakfast much better than North. South Indian breakfast, light Italian lunch and North Indian dinner is the perfect combo for me."},{"prompt":"A 500 ft. train travelling 500 ft per minute must travel through a 500 ft long tunnel.

While some of the videos were fake, others looked genuine and went viral. Popular actresses including Kareena Kapoor, Preity Zinta, Radhika Apte and Soha Ali Khan were forced to face MMS scandals, which created a lot of controversy. With the advent of the social media and messaging apps like \\"Whatsapp\\", leaked videos become viral in no time. And when it involves a popular celebrity, things go even faster. Here is a list of some Bollywood celebrities who were in news due to MMS scandals. 1) Kareena Kapoor and Shahid Kapoor: Kareena Kapoor and Shahid Kapoor were once one of the most popular couples of the tinsel town. Before they broke up, a leaked video showed them lip-locking. 2) Riya Sen and Ashmit Patel: Another former couple who suffered MMS scandal was Riya and Ashmit. A semi nude video of the two having a private moment went viral. 3) Mallika Sherawat: Known for her bold avatars, Mallika Sherawat was in news for the wrong reasons when a sex video was making rounds on the Internet, which purportedly showed the actress making out with a foreigner. Mallika however, termed the video as a fake. 4) Soha Ali Khan: Soha suffered a MMS scandal when a video showed the actress getting undressed at a salon. 5) Radhika Apte: The talented actress also fell prey to scandals when a video was leaked in which she was seen flaunting her private parts.

Later, the actress claimed the video to be morphed. 7) Preity Zinta: She was in news for a similar reason too. One clip, that was not that clear, showed Preity having a shower. The actress called it a fake. 8) Sonakshi Sinha: Recently, Sonakshi Sinha was in news when a sex video went viral on Whatsapp. The lady in the video had striking similarities with the actress but she was also considered to be a Sonakshi lookalike. 9) Hansika Motwani: The \\"Aap Ka Suroor\\" actress, like many other Bollywood actresses, faced a MMS controversy. A video showing a lookalike of Hansika taking a bath went viral. 10) Sherlyn Chopra: The bold diva had her share of MMS scandals when a video apparently showed her stripping in front of a mirror."},{"prompt":"Do people in the United States actually believe that gun reform will cause them to lose their right to own a weapon?","completion":"There’s an old fable about how we domesticated the horse. It seems the wolves were killing many of the creatures on the plains including men and horses. Finally the leader of the men went to ask the horses for help against the common enemy. “Our weapons can defeat the wives but we cannot travel fast enough to catch them. For this purpose only, if you let us ride on your backs, your speed will keep us where our weapons can defeat them. Once they are defeated we can all return to our normal lives. “. The horses agreed and in a great mounted hunt the wolves were defeated. Afterwards the horses said “ together we have won a great victory and saved both of our tribes. Now we should go back to our former lives as you agreed”. To which the human said “ the hell with that. I got you now.

Incapability and “refusal to obey a reasonable instruction\\". Incapability Means that the employee is incapable of carrying out the job. It's a no blame dismissal offence. So say a job requires someone to reach a high shelf and they are too short to do so and they can't use ladders due to vertigo. It's reasonable to dismiss them because they are incapable of doing the job. If someone whose job requires them to meet one on one with a woman says they cannot do that, then for whatever reason they are incapable of doing the job and can be dismissed for incapability. Refusal to obey a reasonable instruction A reasonable instruction is one which is … lawfulmoralpart of the employment contract So in this case the only sticking point is the moral bit. Here's the thing though, it's not the employees moral code which determines this, it's the generally acceptable moral code. So an employee deciding that something is immoral isn't the issue, it's whether it would be generally held to be immoral. A bit more fun to be had with this one, people may well decide to try the tribunal route but I would expect them to lose.

That’s wonderful! No matter how you reach your target weight, keeping track of your goals is essential to any weight loss plan. Whether you want to lose weight for a special event or just because you feel better when you are healthier, creating measurable goals will help you remain on track as you work towards achieving your objectives. Setting a particular, well-defined goal can help you stay motivated and provide a benchmark by which you can measure your achievement. Here are 7 ways to assist you in achieving your weight loss objectives: 1. Set a timeline for your weight loss objective: What specifically are your goals, and when will you achieve them? The majority of people who start a weight loss program desire to be able to fit back into their old jeans. This can change based on a number of factors, including your present weight, how much weight you still need to lose, and your existing diet and exercise habits. For example, if you are a beginner and you want to lose 3 pounds in a month, you will probably succeed. However, if your goal is to lose 50 pounds by the end of the year, it is very ambitious, and you should divide it into smaller, manageable goals. Start by determining your present weight, your target weight, and the deadline you need to reach your goal weight. 2. Decide how much weight you want to lose. Okay, so you’ve set a time frame for your weight loss goal, but how much do you need to lose to reach your ideal weight? Knowing your starting point will help you decide how much weight you want to lose. Measuring yourself and recording your current weight and measurements, such as your stomach and waist, will give you a baseline to measure against as you progress. While you might want to lose as much weight as possible, you need to be realistic with your expectations and set a goal that you know you can achieve. Losing 10 pounds in a month is not realistic, but losing 10 pounds in 6 months is. What’s more, losing too much weight too quickly isn’t healthy and can affect your metabolism.

Do you think India will back down from the purchase?","completion":"No.Buying THAAD and F 35 JSF will be suicidal to India’s Strategic Independence and It’s dream of becoming a Non-aligned ‘Super Power’on Its own right. USA has offered its State-of-the art Terminal High Alititude Anti-ballistic Air Defence system(THAAD)as an alternative to the Russian built S-400 Triumf Missile Defence system. THAAD. THAAD Launcher. Raytheon AN/TPY-2 Radar for THAAD. THAAD Live Fire Exercise. How THAAD works. THAAD is jointly developed by American Military giants Lockheed Martin,Boeing,Raytheon,Honeywell and UT as main contractors.

Even America’s closest allies Saudi Arabia,Qatar,Turkey etc have shown keen interest in the S 400 which shows its great capability and reliability. China was the first foreign customer of the system and India will be the second,if everything goes allright. Why S400 is the Best?. Range: THAAD - 200 KM. S400 - 400 KM. THAAD can track only about 40 targets simultaneously but, S-400 can target upto 80. S 400 is a multi-layered system while THAAD is a Single Layer system. S 400 can shoot down threatening aircraft, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles. It can also engage UAVs and incoming aircraft, Supersonic fighters, AWACS, J-STARS, EA-6B support jammer Aircrafts. THAAD can hit targets only at very high altitudes (minimum 40-50 km) due to which it is useless against fighter jets or long-range tactical aircrafts, making it strictly an Anti-Ballistic missile Defence system.

It’s a simple thing to understand, really. He is a good looking person. He has an incredible voice for his age, and control over his vocals that it takes years for some people to gain. From what we know so far, he is a kind, humble person. He is a gentleman. I’ve had multiple interactions with him that may have biased me, but I would like to think not. He has a good sense of style. It’s usually take, and he is a clean cut guy. He is open with his opinions, when the timing is right, of course. He’s respectful to almost everyone he meets. He is overall, a seemingly down-to-earth, talented, generally nice person. He can play guitar and piano, is a great producer, writes his own music, performs with an electric passion and truly adores his fans. Many girls go crazy over him because he is what people would call the “perfect boy”. Shawn is someone girls can go to, and fantasize is their own boyfriend. I’ll admit, I did it many times when I first got into him. He has music that speaks to millions of people. He’s sweet, he is a beautiful person inside and out.

Science is the only source of truth in our society. So the truth is science. In 1900 Lord kelvin stated that everything had been discovered by science - in 1900 science knew all and everything about the universe. So why do the scientists study, matter, light, black holes, dark matter and so on, is it because science knows little about reality and hides behind higher, abstract mathematics which the very few understand and would then know the real truth, that the mathematical systems cannot be reconciled as science understands nothing of reality only the Mineral kingdom in Nature from which magically the “spark of life” appeared. So science, when boiled down to basics uses magic to explain its superstitions of reality. The Big bang came from pre-existing energy, which came from pre-existing energy, which came from pre-existing energy into infinity - magic in other words without a magician. Science bases its “thinking” upon the artificial thinking invented by Aristotle - although stating that all knowledge before 1840 was superstition, Aristotle lived a few thousand years before 1840 - “Academic” is defined as unrelated to reality and that is what the generalizing, abstract “thinking” of science is unrelated to reality."},{"prompt":"What kind of food do people from the UK eat that is considered an acquired taste to the rest of the world?","completion":"Haggis… a Scottish dish consisting of a sheep's or calf's offal mixed with suet, oatmeal, and seasoning and boiled in a bag, traditionally one made from the animal's stomach.

The Germans did have a lot of success in the Baltic Sea against the Soviets, But the majority of their success cane through using anti submarine nets and extensive minefield to prevent Soviet subs and ships from intercepting merchant ship traffic coming from Sweden and Finland which supplied a lot of the coal and steel the Germans used in the war, as well as assorted other sundry goods.

And I’m impressed that you’ve met all the people in those other continents and countries, getting to know them well enough that you found out they believe they are entitled to free healthcare. But, let’s say for the sake of an argument that they lied to you and that’s not why they have universal healthcare (free to the patient) in those countries. It’s just possible they’ve figured out that it’s better to give everyone access to healthcare and to cut the total costs down to something they can afford. Because in the U.S., this nominally best system doesn’t produce outcomes any better than the British NHS, but costs significantly more. So, the Brits get the same best healthcare but for about 2/3 of the cost.

Engaging in meaningful conversations can help foster understanding, connection, and attraction between individuals. In this article, we will explore some conversational strategies that can enhance your dating experience and help create a strong romantic connection. These strategies are applicable to both online and offline interactions and can assist in building a solid foundation for a potential relationship. Active Listening: Active listening is an essential skill that demonstrates your genuine interest in the other person. It involves giving your full attention, maintaining eye contact, and responding appropriately. By listening actively, you can show empathy and understanding and create a safe space for open and honest communication. Reflecting on what the other person says and asking relevant follow-up questions can help deepen the conversation and showcase your engagement.Open-Ended Questions: To keep the conversation flowing and encourage the other person to share more about themselves, ask open-ended questions. These questions cannot be answered with a simple \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" and instead require elaboration. Open-ended questions allow for more in-depth discussions, enabling both individuals to delve into their thoughts, feelings, and experiences. They provide an opportunity to explore common interests, values, and goals, which are crucial aspects of building a strong romantic connection.Genuine Compliments: Everyone appreciates sincere compliments. Sharing genuine compliments can create a positive and uplifting atmosphere, making the other person feel valued and appreciated. Compliments should focus on the person's character, achievements, or unique qualities. By highlighting specific aspects that genuinely impress you, you can make a lasting impression and show your romantic interest.Shared Experiences and Interests: Finding common ground and shared interests is a powerful way to bond with someone. Discovering activities, hobbies, or experiences that you both enjoy can provide ample conversation material and facilitate a deeper connection. Discussing shared experiences creates a sense of camaraderie and builds a foundation for future interactions and dates.Vulnerability and authenticity: Building trust and emotional intimacy is vital for any romantic relationship. Being open and authentic about your thoughts, feelings, and experiences can encourage the other person to reciprocate, creating a safe space for both individuals to be vulnerable. By sharing personal stories and emotions, you can forge a deeper connection and demonstrate your willingness to be emotionally available.Sense of Humor: Laughter is a universal language that can bring people closer together. Having a sense of humor and sharing lighthearted moments can help create a relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere during dating conversations. However, it is essential to be mindful of the other person's boundaries and adapt your humor accordingly."},{"prompt":"Were there any Western equivalents to the Japanese Samurai? What is the closest?","completion":"There really isn’t one. In popular imagination samurai are the equivalent of European knights, but samurai were a lord’s vassals, whereas knights could be quite independent and didn’t really have a code of honour of their own. The notion of chivalry attached to knighthood is the result of a Christian attempt to create a ‘Christian’ knight. From which it should already be clear that there was nothing necessarily Christian about being a knight. For instance, the knights that accompanied their lord on crusade did so, because they were being paid for their service , not out of some imagined moral obligation. That doesn’t mean there were no Christian knights: most of them were. But the ideal of a Christian knight was primarily exemplified by the struct orders associated with the crusades: the Knights Templar, the Hospitallers, etc. That, however, was an ideal type of knight. and even that ideal type of knight had little in common with Japanese samurai."},{"prompt":"Why is Don Lemon not released from CNN while Megyn Kelly was released from NBC for saying much less?","completion":"This is a very good question that i have been wondering about myself.

You have created a place where we can share our input about almost anything, whether it’s past experiences that we can relate to or if we just want to say what’s on our minds, you’ve made that possible. Here are some things I like to thank you for: Quora’s Partner Program - This Is an excellent way for any Quorans, whether it’s new Quorans or popular Quorans (both adults and teens), this program can inspire them to contribute to the Quora platform. Plus, they can benefit from doing so by making money off of questions they ask. Something else I’ve noticed is how, with the program, some people write questions just for the money, and not really for the sake of asking a good question.Spaces - They categorize not just topics, but people’s interests. They’re also a way for people to discuss certain topics or events that have taken or are taking place. Also, I gotta admit, it was an interesting transition from blogs to spaces, and it worked out quite well!Quora World Meetups - They're an excellent way for Quorans from around the globe to come together and meet each other! Something I might suggest is a website in which only Quora members can use to communicate via webcam. This can help people talk to each other without going anywhere.

In a Hard Disk, everything you write once, is written there for eternity. So, how files are deleted then?? Actually, when you delete a file, the OS hides (or adds an attribute to) its address stored in a special area of disk called FAT. This means the file actually isn’t erased but only its address get hidden from the user. So, anyone with a little knowledge can retrieve his/her files from his hard disk using some tools. But, you can try a bit of other things like :- Breaking the Whole file into a number small fragmentsIf you know a little coding then just build a software to break the file into a number of pieces and hide them at different corners of your computer, but you may need to re-join the fragments before using it. Corrupting The FileSo, that even after retrieval file will not be readable. Changing its Extension (it is not recommended if the finder is an FBI agent but for ordinary person it will be a bit confusing)Usually the OS would get to know the type of file only by reading its extension.Changing it might helpfor example, if the file is an mp4 file but you renamed it to .docx or .txt, something like that then the file will be opened by a word processing software like MS-Word or Notepad which will definitely not be able to read the video file. And the finder may mislead to a conclusion that the file is corrupted. Encrypting a File (Most Recommended)Follow Below Steps:-Encrypt The File using some software or you can do it manually if you know a bit of coding (if it is already not encrypted).Decrypt it before using itread/write/modifybefore saving the file encrypt it again and save ! Every encrypting software encrypts in there own way, so until and unless FBI do not know the encrypting software and know that the file is encrypted, it will be very difficult for them to obtain the information. However, there is never a 100% probability, the FBI may soon realise that it is encrypted and may break the encryption. Finally, You can try many more different possible combinations of the above options like you can try breaking the file, then encrypting each fragment , then hiding them into different corners after changing their extensions. Concludingly, You just need to make the file unreadable for a random user, only you should know how to use/read the file."},{"prompt":"Chennai is currently facing water crisis, what are the short term and long solutions? What is expected from Government and what should people do on their part?","completion":"We have no government. Rather we have a set of incompetents whose primary aim is to devise ways to cling on to power. That power does not do us any good,?it may do to them. Whenever there is excess rainfall it goes to the sea. We don’t think of deepening the reservoirs except as a n after thought. If all the big waterbodies had been deepened substantially, we would be able to store enough water to last the dry periods. It is too much to expect the present non-government to do snything. People have to clean up their home water conservation systems, use less water, don’t use showers but use buckets, water their plants sparingly etc., But in the longer term these Rip Van Winkles have to wake up from their coma and take appropriate measures. Stealing river sand depletes ground water resources and it takes place everyday with official connivance. Is has been estimated if small and medium ponds are deepened we won’t have water scarcity and ground water will get recharged. But small water bodies have Ben encroached upon by local politically powerful. Water conserving crops should be encouraged - not sugar cane. We can always buy sugar from surplus states.

It's totally her life. We are having no rights to get indulged in her life. Did any stranger has ever asked you with whom you slept? But still, if you want an answer, 95% she might haven't slept with the actor. To get a role, an actress has to sleep with the producer and not with the actor.

Is this borderline high?","completion":"No"},{"prompt":"w did a plane crash on the upper floors of the World Trade Center result in the entire building collapsing?","completion":"It didn’t crash on the upper floors. It crashed about 30 stories below the upper floors. That means the weight of those top 30 stories came crashing down, when the weakened part collapsed. And that’s what did it: the weight and velocity of those top 30 floors falling straight down, which was enough to take out one floor— then the next, and so forth. In short, the building was only built to withstand normal forces of natural stresses; not the weight of the building itself, if several floors were suddenly removed. Simply put: the plane was carrying 10,000 gallons of fuel. Fuel burns hot, and can weaken structural materials, in addition to the damage caused by the plane-crash itself. After an hour of burning, the stress of the building’s weight, simply exceeded the weakened strength of the building. Like “The Camel’s Back,” i.e. it reached the last straw."},{"prompt":"Why do people from other countries think the USA’s healthcare system is so great?","completion":"I am an American. I don't know a single person who lives here, including most physicians and other healthcare professionals, who think our healthcare system is any thing but horrible.

He is considered a hero here in Romania, and by enough people that the term ‘national hero’ makes sense, largo sensu. There is a second side to ‘national hero’ in today’s context, and I feel (cannot really explain why) that it is this side that interests you more. There are enough answers on Quora and enough material in general to explain why Vlad Tepes might be ‘heroic’. His figure was indeed co-opted to a more propagandistic effect by the communists and his actions were emphasized as much as possible around the defense of his homeland and people. Vlad, Stephen the Great, Mircea the Elder, Michael the Brave and others got the same treatment to the point were fewer people know about their exploits outside the boundaries of what would later become Romania than they do about their local exploits. This is the dimension of Vlad Tepes, the ‘national hero’, a subject of state propaganda. Nowadays, while I cannot deny that the propagandistic intentions are still there, they have not materialized in any comparable way, even in this new world of anti-immigration. It is not necessary, as we do not need Vlad and the others to motivate us, we have many other reminders about the rule of the crescent. So, in conclusion, my answer is: broadly speaking, yes, he is for all the reasons listed below and above. Strictly speaking? No, not anymore."},{"prompt":"any way?","completion":"Well, yes !If I put it in simple words, How can we expect others to have faith in our capacity and capability if we ourselves have a doubt on it.

Like under the couch, or that back corner of the basement storage area that only sees the light of day at Christmas. He will watch the kids while I sleep in, but i try not to no matter how little sleep I am running on because he feeds the kids garbage like MnMs then lets them run wild.

I’ve been collecting car guide books since I’m little (my parents gave me one when I was four, they knew early that they gave birth to a future petrolhead haha), and I buy one each year. These things are bibles. Still, I don’t know if a similar reference book is existing in the US/Europe, but in Quebec (land of French Canadians), there are two on the market. It’s basically a new cars dictionnary where they list every car on the market available new for each year, and they give their recommendations and opinions about each car in it. Pretty useful. And generally, when I go in small librairies, I always look for old ones, since you can find them for less than 10. Anyway, about a year ago, I found a 2006 edition for 6 at the place I go, and I bought it. Here it is, for curious. So, I do my usual browsing in it, and when I arrived to the page of the Chrysler Sebring (I browse all pages, including crappy cars.), I found something strange. I first thought to Canadian Tire money: But it wasn’t. It looked basically like this: Being also a coin/money collector, I was naturally curious, and when I flipped it, I basically saw Saddam Hussein’s face (so older than 2003) and some Arabic writing. On the other side? “Central Bank of Iraq” and “Two Hundred Fifty Dinars”, in English. You got it, it’s money (even if it was worthing nothing as I found later). But from Iraq (and I live in Quebec, Canada), in a French-Canadian car guide. Why? Who? Where? When? So many questions still unanswered. But again, why put money in a book, if it’s worthing nothing? And it wasn’t noticable from behind, so the rich guy’s book markpage option isn’t available. Probably not as strange as other people’s answers, but definitively one of the strangest things I’ve found (with a astonishly tiny Turkish coin from 1966 I found in my grandma’s purse, since she never left the province) and that I remember, if not the strangest with these conditions."},{"prompt":"What are easy recipes to learn if I don't know how to cook or even prepare basic dishes?","completion":"Learning to cook in this 21st century is as easy as ABC.

It is run by millionaires who are beholden to other millionaires, and they don’t care about you except to the extent that they need your approval as a voter. The government of the United States (those millionaires) see their job as preserving the wealth and privilege of the wealthy and privileged, and to protect them from the rest of us. The rest of it is kabuki. In 1932, in order to save capitalism, which had just thrown the entire nation into the worst depression in our history, Franklin Roosevelt proposed the New Deal. This was a complete rethinking of the purpose of our government to include the well being of all the citizens, and not just the elite. And it kept the nation from rebelling. There had been a real danger of it, and it could very well have ended with the Reign of Terror Redux.

Another American????"},{"prompt":"Would Genoa forward Piatek fit in at AC Milan? Would he be able to pursue his impressive scoring streak?","completion":"I think he fits well, but don’t expect him to score as often as before Let’s begin by saying that Piatek is overperforming his expected goals by ~40% at the moment, scoring at a rate of 0.73 goals per 90 mins. He is unlikely to maintain this over the rest of the season (see [LINKED_TEXT: Understat] [URL: http://understat.com/] radar below) That being said, his numbers are really, really good for someone who played in one of the poorer offenses in Serie A. In terms of shot quality and volume, Genoa are the 6th poorest offense in the league. Piatek was practically half of Genoa’s attacking output, both in terms of expected goals (0.5 xG per 90) and actual goals. These stats are simply a reflection of a player who is truly gifted at finding and attacking spaces. Look at a compilation of his goals with Genoa, and it’s essentially a handbook of good striker movements. Powerful and expertly-timed runs behind defendersWhen receiving a cross or cutback, he often slows down and adjusts his runs to trick defenders and give himself more time and space to strike the incoming ball.[LINKED_TEXT: “Ghosting” movements] [URL: https://www.quora.com/Ronaldos-art-of-ghosting-is-a-rare-exploit-in-soccer-What-other-players-have-used-this-type-of-off-the-ball-movement/answer/Jos%C3%A9-P%C3%A9rez-4?ch=10&share=b8d64a47&srid=nyuC] similar to those of Ronaldo and Icardi.Really good at making low, driven shots from a variety of positions and situations in the boxNot super tall (6 ft / 1.83m), but has excellent jumping and heading techniqueHe also occasionally comes short to help his midfielders and provide a passing outlet. He then lays off the ball with a simple, efficient and intelligent first touch. But how will Piatek fit in at Milan? [LINKED_TEXT: I was assigned to cover last Saturday’s Milan v. Napoli for Between The Posts] [URL: https://betweentheposts.net/ac-milan-ssc-napoli-paqueta-and-piatek-leave-good-first-impression-at-san-siro-in-goalless-but-entertaining-draw-0-0/], so I had the opportunity to watch Piatek’s debut with the Rossoneri. He was subbed in around the 70th min, but even in that short span of time, he changed the game. Napoli still dominated possession in the final 20 mins of the game (60% to 40%), but Milan could now punish Napoli’s attempts on the counter by sending passes into space for Piatek. The timing and power of his runs kept Albiol and Koulibaly constantly on edge, to the point he forced a yellow card on Albiol. I talk about this game vs. Napoli because it exemplifies the biggest advantage Piatek has over the departed Higuaín: speed and power. Higuaín is one of the greatest goal scorers of the last decade, but he’s 31 now. He’s slower, not as physically dominant. He plays in deeper positions now because he doesn’t have the speed and power to constantly run into space and pin down defenders. This means he can’t get into good scoring positions as often as before. This is reflected in his numbers, as explained by Statbomb’s Ted Knutson: Higuaín’s shot volume in the box has decreased significantly over the last two seasons. Looking around media takes today, I'm surprised our podcast take on Higuain ended up quite so contrarian.His trending the last two seasons - and especially his shot volume from 12 yards or closer, which has a knock on for xG - is VERY worrying. — Ted Knutson (@mixedknuts) [LINKED_TEXT: January 23, 2019] [URL: https://twitter.com/mixedknuts/status/1088086859664801792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] Milan definitely has creative deficits (everything depends too much on Suso), but Higuaín’s physical decline also hindered their attack. Creating great chances not only requires great playmakers, but also players who excel at attacking spaces and getting into scoring positions. Higuaín’s increased struggles in this latter aspect made it harder for Milan to turn their possessions into shots, and it heavily hindered their counterattacking capabilities. Fortunately, Milan has also done another great signing to compensate their creative deficits: Brazilian midfield talent Lucas Paquetá. They needed a midfielder like him urgently, and he’s had an immediate impact on the quality of Milan’s possession game. Against Napoli, for example, he was providing much needed passing options in between the lines. And with his outstanding passes and controls, he created great passing combinations with Çalhanoğlu on the left side, which allowed Milan to progress despite Napoli’s pressing block. So all in all, I’d like to think the tactical context for Piatek in Milan looks favorable. Milan is improving on their creative deficits with Paquetá, and Piatek will be an improvement on Higuaín when it comes to attacking spaces with speed and power. Let’s hope this can translate into more goals for the Polish striker. I repeat, however, that I don’t expect him to maintain his outstanding scoring rate of 0.73 goals per 90. If he could keep scoring at a rate of ~1 goal every 2 games (0.5 goals per 90) that would be quite good!"},{"prompt":"w can cells be seen with the naked eye?","completion":"Many are visible, including the ISS, which actually has a website telling people when it will be over their area."},{"prompt":"Who is a better Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi or Manmohan Singh?","completion":"Apple to be compared with apple!"},{"prompt":"Do you think Mark Cuban would make a good POTUS?","completion":"Good grief…what have you been smoking?"},{"prompt":"there anything about the Kobe Bryant helicopter crash that just doesn’t add up?","completion":"It is certainly a goldmine that can be milked for another few hundred hours by broadcast news stations.

(Left)Agni I (Right) Agni Prime Details of Agni Prime A defence official associated with Agni project said the Agni Prime has been developed with the cutting-edge technologies used in 4000-km range Agni-IV and 5000-km Agni-V missiles. The two-stage and solid-fuelled missile will be guided by inertial navigation systems based on advanced ring-laser gyroscopes. Both stages have composite rocket motors and guidance systems are equipped with electromechanical actuators. Need of Agni Prime While Agni-I is a single-stage missile, Agni Prime has two stages.It will have a canister version to bring down the time required to launch the missile. Unlike the single-stage Agni-I, the double-stage Agni Prime will have a canister version with the flexibility to be fired from both road and rail-mobile launchers. A Missile canister protect the missile from foreign matters inflow, shock vibration and weather such as rain and snow, And facilitates smooth ejection at launch. The sleek missile that weighs less than that of the previous variant due to the integration of new technologies will be more lethal in terms of power and killing ability.

I asked the mother to get her kids under control, this was an adult film and rambunctious children should not be allowed to ruin the experience for other customers. She gave me the brushoff but eventually theatre personnel showed up (summoned by other patrons) and told her to behave. I wouldn’t have minded if this had been a kids’ movie: Paw Patrol Meets LOL. I would have fully expected noisy, rambunctious kids. But during a horror movie, adults should be able to watch the show in peace without children."},{"prompt":"When is noon: 12:0012:01, 12:001:00, or the exact second of when the clock strikes 12:00?","completion":"Noon is neither AM nor PM. Technically, it only exists for the instant of 12:00. It’s called PM, and Midnight is called AM because they initiate that period of the day. The term Noon is applied broadly to the time in that hour—the Noon Hour, but seldom beyond several minutes after 12:00. The term began in Latin as Nona Hora -the ninth hour. This was in the afternoon at a time we now call 3:00PM. It was the ninth hour in the Roman church day, also called the Noones. As it was anglicized over the years, it became midday, finally and officially becoming 12o’clock in the 14th century. Until the 19th century, Noon occurred at exactly the moment the Sun was highest in the sky, directly on the local meridian—a shadow would lay pointing directly North/South. Clocks would be set by this. But the onset of railroad transportation and travel required more coordination of time. Time zones were established to coordinate travel. Noon became measured at a single point and communicated throughout the zone."},{"prompt":"Which is the most unbiased news outlet?","completion":"[LINKED_TEXT: https://rumble.com/v392m2k-see-christies-reaction-after-trump-cancels-his-own-promoted-event.html] [URL: https://rumble.com/v392m2k-see-christies-reaction-after-trump-cancels-his-own-promoted-event.html]"},{"prompt":"Why would a narcissist block you on Facebook then unblock you then block you again?","completion":"The answer is pretty simple, the chase. They love the chase. Something like this happened to me very recently. I was head over heels in love with a guy, and he broke my heart in the worst way possible. I kept on trying to get him back in my life for a very long time, while he just kept playing with my feelings. At first, I thought he is bipolar because his decisions just kept changing according to his convenience, but then I started to see a pattern. Finally, when I had enough and cut him off for good, I thought he wouldn't contact me again, since he already didn't care very much about how I was feeling. The day I cut him off for good, I had a talk about this with my best friend, who told me to just give it a couple months and he will try to barge back in my life. He was absolutely right. He called me from an unknown number a couple days ago and at this point, when I was not chasing him anymore, he was trying to feed himself things like I haven't moved on from him and etc. Seeing me not care at all was absolutely driving him crazy because obviously, a narcissist loves the chase. They will keep on making you feel like they are the best you can do and keep treating you like trash, but the moment you will finally take a stand against them, it will drive them absolutely mad."},{"prompt":"What are the best street foods in India?","completion":"Thanks for A2A [LINKED_TEXT: Zeba Khan] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Zeba-Khan-931] India’s famous street food that most people like is Pani Puri.

Is it a particle beam? Is he firing protons?","completion":"In the Marvel Universe, there’s been TWO definitions on what his power is. First up, the energy he sends out is a high energy discharge that only hit with pure kinetic force. With his visor, he can focus it into a pinpoint or a devastating wide beam. (Pinterest - If you only hurt the one you love, is this Cyclops self-loving?) As for where it comes from, there’s been TWO takes in the Marvel Universe where as the 1st, it was theorized that he was absorbing sunlight and surrounding energy around him into his optic blasts. However, this was later revised a few years later, and that’s the current basis of his powers. His eyes are no longer eyes per se, but are actually DIMENSIONAL PORTALS to a dimension that’s entirely out of energy. (from Pinterest, The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe, Vol. 2) So this way, every time he opens his eyes, the dimension is breached and that energy pours through as a wave of pure crimson kinetic force. One interesting thing… in the past, there’s been a number of heroes and villains such as Darkstar, Cloak, The Shroud and such who have been able to access the “Darkforce Dimension” as their mutant or magical power as a means to teleport, project force and so on and has been used for quite a few interesting stories.

I was at a restaurant in Cambridge that served small plates of various UK sorts of things. Reading through the menu, there were several things I’d had in the UK previously and, of course, some stuff readily available outside of the UK. Blood pudding was something that I’d heard of, but not actually come across before. I asked the waiter about it. As the name implies, blood is a principle component. He described the traditional version and then the version that they had. Being jet lagged and generally tired, I wasn’t up for it, so ordered several other things. When he brought out my food, he also brought an order of the blood pudding so that I could try it since I was so interested. Oh joy. I did eat it, feeling it would be rude to waste the food, particularly since they were being generous. I don’t recall it being as bad as it sounded, but I’ve never felt the need to order it again."},{"prompt":"What was the strangest fast food order you've seen?","completion":"A few months ago I was a coffee barista in a local coffee shop in my town, a lady ordered a nutella frappuccino but without coffee…just milk, sugar, whipped cream and nutella.

One reason is people need factual information to make decisions about their life. However, the person with alzheimers does not have the ability to process information and make rational decisions based on new information. The classic situation is the family that insists on orienting grandma to reality. If grandfather died years ago, each time she asks for him, and is informed that he is dead, you only provoke grief and sadness. What good does this reality orientation do the mental well being of your grandma, none whatsoever. It is far better to play along and say grandpa is still at work, or some other explanation that promotes calmness. The nurse at the local Alzheimers Association calls these fiblets, or therapeutic lies. You say what ever promotes calm and comfort for the person with Alzheimers. To tell the truth to someone with Alzheimers can be mentally cruel. As most people have answered, it is best to go with what the person believes. You do not need to invent a different scenario.

Here are some potential reasons: Adjusted meal timing: By eating at consistent times each day, the body adapts to the eating schedule, and hunger signals may align with those specific times. Over time, the body becomes accustomed to this routine, reducing hunger outside of designated meal times. Adequate portion sizes: When individuals consume balanced and nutrient-dense meals that provide sufficient calories and nutrients, their bodies are more likely to feel satisfied until the next meal. Including adequate protein, healthy fats, and high-fiber foods can contribute to prolonged satiety. Fat adaptation: Some individuals who practice intermittent fasting or alternate-day fasting may have undergone a process called fat adaptation. This occurs when the body becomes more efficient at using stored body fat as an energy source. When in a fasted state, the body can tap into its fat stores, which can help suppress hunger. Hydration: Staying properly hydrated can help manage hunger between meals. Drinking water or other non-caloric beverages can create a feeling of fullness, reducing the urge to snack or eat. Additionally, sometimes thirst is mistaken for hunger, so drinking water can help differentiate between the two. Mindful eating: People who eat mindfully tend to pay closer attention to their food, savor each bite, and eat more slowly. This approach allows them to better recognize and appreciate their body's signals of fullness, which can lead to improved appetite control. Balanced diet: A well-rounded diet with adequate macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) can help regulate hunger. Including a variety of foods that provide essential nutrients ensures that the body's nutritional needs are met, potentially reducing cravings and hunger. Adapting to metabolic changes: Some individuals who follow specific dietary patterns, such as the ketogenic diet, report a reduced appetite over time. This may be due to changes in metabolic hormone levels that occur with dietary modifications, helping to regulate hunger. It's important to note that individual experiences with hunger and appetite can vary significantly. People have different metabolic rates, activity levels, and overall health, so what works for one person may not work for another. If you're considering changing your eating habits, it's advisable to consult a healthcare professional or registered dietitian who can provide personalized guidance and support."},{"prompt":"When Jordan annexed the West Bank was there any Palestinian resistance against Jordanian rule? Was the Jordanian administration formally legalized?","completion":"The Jordanians actively integrated the West Bank into de jure Jordanian territory. The Jordanian Parliament had representatives from the West Bank from 1950–1988. (Yes, the West Bank had representatives in Jordanian Parliament from 1967–1988 even though Jordan had no control over the actual territory and the representatives could not effectively communicate with their constituency.) Within Jordan, this was a legalized system, but only five countries (one being Jordan) recognized the possession as legal. As for whether there was Palestinian resistance to Jordanian rule, I am unaware of anything. The Palestinian-Jordanian antagonism that came to a head in Black September in 1970 only really started in the aftermath of the Battle of Karameh in 1968, and all occurred after Jordan had lost the West Bank to Israel. From the PLO’s founding in 1964 until Israel’s victory in the Six-Day War in 1967, the PLO specifically excluded the Arab-held parts of the former Mandate of Palestine from their charter."},{"prompt":"Why can’t I tell a narcissist how I really feel about how they treated me?","completion":"Fear and courage must battle it out.

Being an amalgamation of colleges that once were independent, University buildings are spread out. So one has to mind walking distances to classes. The University is blended in the city. Each college has a campus but all campuses are not at a distance to the city. This is true of the St. George campus. There are two more campuses, Scarborough and Mississauga.

He's a scientist with strategist friends to make sure he's not putting his effort into something completely superfluous. He's presented with a problem or concept, then figures the rest out on his own.

Many doctrines of demons have infested the church, and it has taken a long time to weed them out. Today’s Christian Church does not have the same lack of understanding that they had in the past. A lot of people of every walk of life accept the Lord’s teachings, and they simply reject the literal fundamental nonsense, that is slowly being dismantled further, by the Christian Church.

Was pleasantly surprised to find a boiled egg as well as the quintessential potato (aloo), we Bengalis, LUST for. Another delicacy to savour: Luchi with mutton kosha. Tunday kababi (indira nagar) - Comes pretty close to the kolkata biryani in terms of aroma and flavour. This restaurant serves lucknow biryani. Have been coming over frequently.

Most power outages are cause by downed power lines, so my gas supply is stable. It ran continuously 3+ days last summer after a tornado came thru the region and knocked out the power. I am concerned that a regional long term outage would stop gas flow (EMP for instance).

There are a variety of methods one can use to reduce face fat, including diet and exercise, facial exercises, and even some lifestyle changes. 1. Diet and Exercise: Eating a balanced diet and engaging in regular cardiovascular exercise are essential components of reducing face fat. Eating a diet that is high in complex carbohydrates, lean proteins, and healthy fats will help to reduce overall body fat, including facial fat. Additionally, engaging in at least 30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise five times per week will help to burn calories and melt away fat. 2. Facial Exercises: There are a variety of facial exercises that can be used to help reduce face fat. These exercises include things like puckering your lips and making exaggerated facial expressions, or simply massaging the facial muscles in a circular motion. Doing these facial exercises for five to ten minutes each day will help to tone and tighten the facial muscles, which can reduce the appearance of fat in the face. 3. Lifestyle Changes: Making a few small lifestyle changes can also help to reduce face fat. Drinking plenty of water and avoiding sugary beverages and processed foods will help to reduce overall body fat, including fat in the face. Additionally, reducing stress and getting adequate rest will also help to reduce facial fat. 4. Skin Care: Taking care of your skin is also important when it comes to reducing face fat. Using a good facial cleanser and moisturizer will help to keep the skin healthy and hydrated, which can help to reduce the appearance of facial fat. Additionally, using a good sunscreen can help to protect the skin from sun damage, which can also help to reduce facial fat. By making a few changes to your diet and lifestyle, and incorporating some facial exercises and skin care, you can reduce face fat and achieve a more sculpted and toned facial appearance. With a little bit of dedication and effort, you can reduce face fat and be proud of the results. Please support my work by upvoting this article.

I’ll add two more. I feel proud to have people in my country who are working day and night to bring changes into the society. One such person is Sandeep Desai. He started his philanthropic work by begging (seeking donations) in local trains of Mumbai. He left his career in marine engineering where he could have earned thousands of dollars per month and later a job as an academician, and went on to establish Shloka Missionaries in Mumbai. He says he was moved by the project reports of his students (during his career as a professor in a renowned management schools in financial capital of India) about the underprivileged children not getting proper education (and in many cases no education at all). He used to be on trains daily for 6 hours a day convincing commuters and detailing his plans and cause for two-three years starting 2010. Seven years on and Sandeep Desai has a school in Yvatmal draught hit district of Maharashtra and three others in Rajasthan. He was later supported by people like Salman Khan, Arvind Kejriwal and some corporate houses in his mission to educate India. Now he has taken a break from ‘begging’ in trains but the 65 year old promises to go back when he is needed to! Sandeep Desai would have suffered what not in collecting the donations and establishing the schools on mere wordy promises and explanations to commuters and government officials. Are you looking for 2nd person’s description who has a big heart? So here it is… Sandeep’s ‘begging’ exercise would have been a miserable failure if not for the commuters who donated generously every time the professor boarded their compartment. It’s you, me and every other citizen of India who has in him/her that fire, zeal and eagerness to bring some change, no matter however small.

Therefore, if you train them they can change their shape and be stronger. That makes your singing more powerful and usually helps to achieve the sounds earlier unavailable. On the web, you can find a lot of videos where top-shelf stars tell how exercises changed their singing. For example, on the ronadersonvocals, you can find testimonials of Nelly Furtado, Kylie Minogue, Natalie Imbruglia on how training and exercises with a vocal coach to the stars changed their way of singing. Some of them gained even an octave at their vocal range.

Believe it or not, ETH is the true store of value and the first crypto asset to ever have the words \\"store of value \\" mentioned in the white paper during its launch. So am super bullish on ETH considering that we are already in phase two (which according to the analyst) is when Ethereum starts outperforming BTC. As for doge, I play it as an opportunist, buy the news, sell the rumor . Being that doge is nothing but a meme coin, as a veteran investor in the crypto market, I wouldn't say doge has any possible future utility other than the ones that doge enthusiasts give to it. But ofcourse we are in the market to make money and personally I made a lot of easy money on doge during the first cycle of the bull market. Both longing and shorting doge.

While it can easily argued that corruption causes poverty, the reverse is also partly true. One issue is that many of key government personnel - such as cops and clerks are paid quite low in poor countries. Police in many parts of India earn about Rs.2000/month (30). Even honest players in such environment will be tempted to deal under the table. US and UK got rich, before they got less corrupt.Fear of reprisals: In the US no one dares touch a cop. If a cop is killed, the entire might of US machinery will be upon the criminal. India has a fairly strong underworld and honest officers are often silenced violently. Our law & order system is not strong enough to wipe out the gangs. Before we take on corruption, we have to make sure that our honest officers don't end up like [LINKED_TEXT: Satyendra Dubey] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyendra_Dubey]. That requires a strong war on gangs. Excessive government: Our government tries to run everything from airlines to mines and hotels. Ask your parents about the time they had to bribe a government official to get a scooter, electricity connection or a telephone line. Most of these are privatized now and we no longer pay bribes to buy cars, motorcycles or phones. If everything else is equal, more government leads to more corruption.Poor technology: In the US, almost all records are digitized and made public. You can scroll over any street and find out what is the sale price of any house (very hard to buy homes with illicit money). In India, things still run on paper. The biggest movement of blackmoney is in land dealings and we don't have the records properly digitized yet. Once you put all sale records online and interface it with Google maps, a lot of whoppers will be found out (many houses are drastically underpriced for black money movement).

You can’t. Us as humans do not truly and most likely will never truly comprehend infinity, nor nothingness, and it is important to remember they are not numbers, but merely concepts. It is hard to conceive having “nothing” of something in our life, as even if we thing about it, it is there. It is also hard to conceive infinity as well, because we always have a limit to something. It just seems implausible to have a never ending supply of something, as we currently know everything to be finite. Despite this however, I will get you to understand both why we cannot comprehend infinity/nothingness, while also trying to get you to “feel” infinity. Imagine a field of grass, seemingly endless. Now, take out one, singular blade and count to one. Replace it and pull out a different blade and add another to the counter. Continue doing this until you have grabbed and replaced every single blade. Then grab two at a time, then three, etc… never repeating a combination and counting along the way. After this, repeat the entire process, adding on to your count. My guess is you didn’t even get past the first round in your imaginary grass field. This is because thinking about infinity is mind-numbing. It would seem like there is an infinite number of combinations, because after a while, your brain just gets tired; however, modern mathematics would prove otherwise. Likewise, if and when you reach the last stage before restarting, every blade of grass in the field is gone, so it would feel like nothingness. However, because you know it exists somewhere else, it is hard to believe that there is no grass ever. Now imagine doing this with a beach. This is why both infinity and nothingness are just concepts, rather than numbers. They are too hard to set a value on, as that value can be fitted to create another, closer value; while in reality, as you get closer to infinity, you get farther, and as you get farther from nothingness, you are closer.

It is important to note that earning income from a blog is not guaranteed, and success requires consistent effort and the implementation of effective monetization strategies. There are several ways to monetize a blog, including: 1. Advertising: Displaying ads on your blog can generate revenue through methods such as pay-per-click (PPC) or cost-per-impression (CPM) advertising. The income from ads can vary widely depending on factors like the ad network used, the ad placement, and the niche's competitiveness. 2. Affiliate Marketing: Promoting products or services through affiliate links on your blog can earn you commissions when your readers make purchases through those links. Commissions can range from a small percentage to a significant portion of the sale, depending on the affiliate program and the products/services promoted. 3. Sponsored Content: Collaborating with brands or businesses to create sponsored content or sponsored posts can provide an additional source of income. Compensation for sponsored content varies based on factors such as your blog's reach, audience engagement, and the nature of the partnership. 4. Digital Products: Selling digital products, such as ebooks, online courses, or digital downloads, can be a lucrative income stream for bloggers. The earnings depend on factors like the pricing, demand for the product, marketing efforts, and the perceived value of the digital product. 5. Services and Consultation: Offering services related to your blog's niche, such as coaching, consulting, or freelance work, can be another source of income. Rates for services vary based on the expertise and market demand. It's important to keep in mind that building a successful and profitable blog takes time, effort, and consistent content creation. Income potential varies widely, ranging from a modest side income to a full-time sustainable income and beyond, depending on the niche, audience size, and monetization strategies employed.

To attack from Lebanon airspace hiding behind civilian airplanes is their way of proving their cowardice and malign nature. Last time they attacked Syria from the occupied Golan Heights the retaliation of the SAA was surprising for them and stunned them. When they attacked the military post in Lattakia from behind the [LINKED_TEXT: Russian IL20 airplane] [URL: https://www.syrianews.cc/s300-air-defense-delivered-syria/], they didn’t expect the Syrians would actually fire at them. Their bad luck is the 5 decades old S200 hit the Russian plane instead. If it had hit one of their fighter jets it would have been better for them. Since the delivery, finally, of the 4 decades old S300 batteries to Syria, Israeli fighter jets became more exposed to the air-defense missiles. If an S200 in the hands of the SAA could shoot down an F16, what would the S300 in those hands do? [LINKED_TEXT: Syria Confronts New Israeli Aggression; Shoots Down Criminal F-16 | Syria News] [URL: https://www.syrianews.cc/syria-confronts-israeli-aggression/] Not only they used the Lebanese high mountains separating Syria from Lebanon as a cover, they also used two civilian airplanes carrying hundreds of passengers as their cover. How heinous are the Israelis to carry out such act of threatening the lives of hundreds of civilians? And in NO SELF-DEFENSE?! The Syrian Air-Defense heroes held back from firing at the fighter jets hiding behind the commercial planes in order to avoid a catastrophe, but did shoot an air-defense missile over Haifa, occupied Palestine aka Israel, which blew up and caused massive damage and horror in the region there, especially near the town of Khdeira. That response was the Syrians telling the Israelis: Next time expect these missiles instead of shooting the civilian airplanes you’re hiding behind will fall on more strategic targets deep inside your territories when defending Syrian skies. Let’s hope the Israelis got the message and learned the lesson, this time.

There was only a month left for my final exams to commence and neither had I started preparing for it nor was I serious. Noticing my frivolous conduct, one day he remarked: Manisha all these ten-twelve months I have worked hard in teaching you concepts, clarifying your doubts, giving you tests and planning your assignments. Your parents have worked harder to pay for your school and tuition fees, in preparing your tiffin and helping you with everything. But you know what, you have worked the hardest in studying those concepts, solving questions, taking tests and completing your assignments. Do you want all that to go in vain? Once I gave his words a thought, it was as if those words just roused me from my slumber. It all made sense afterall. I decided that I would not let all that hardwork go down the drain. Although I did not perform very well but then atleast I worked for it. Till date those words continue to rouse me from my slumber and encourage me to keep working even when I just wish to quit when things go haywire.

A good near decade or so after that divorce, the kid was sent to live with us for a while (I was barely a toddler at the time, so all I have from that time is stories and possible brain trauma). Kid was also a psychopath, and I mean clinically. Like, bragged to the judge kind of psychopath (at the time, legally an admission of guilt). And that’s when my mother demanded the paternity test, because that behavior was very unlike any of us who had come from dad. We also discovered that the kids mom was involved in a custody dispute with the actual father. But, let’s move onto a good relationship. My eldest siblings are my maternal half-siblings, yet they are willing to acknowledge their step-father as an actual parent (They and I have some… problems with mom). And you know what my father taught me? It doesn’t really matter if you pass down your genetics, the bond of shared beliefs, ethics, culture, and identity is far stronger than blood.

The Tibetan Buddhist teacher Chögyam Trungpa talked about the difference between compassion and “idiot compassion.” The difference lies in our perceptiveness about what is truly needed in a situation. Idiot compassion is about always trying to give people what they want, while true compassion is about giving them what they need. To know the difference between these things we need wisdom. Luckily, wisdom is not far away, for, according to the Buddhist teachings, it is an innate aspect of our minds. But we are usually prevented from accessing it by our habitual reactiveness and mistaken way of looking at things. If we look carefully at the reasons we tend to be taken advantage of, we’ll find things like people-pleasing tendencies and a desire to be liked or accepted. These things come from low self-esteem and are actually ego-reinforcing. They show where we need to develop and strengthen ourselves. So one key here is that the first target or recipient of our compassion should be ourselves: what do we need that will help us the most, benefit us the most? And how can we give that to ourselves? Do we know how to be generous to ourselves, not in a greedy, selfish way, but in a wise, kind way? What if we were our own best friend or our own child or our own dog? What kind of care and concern would we show for ourselves? By treating ourselves well, looking after ourselves properly, we’re starting to show the respect and esteem that we deserve, and we might not feel so needy about getting the approval of others. At the same time, when it comes to other people who might need help, we can learn to trust our gut instincts. For if there is something not right about a situation, something wrong or unjust, we will probably sense it if we pay attention to our inner voice. Deep down, we usually know when we’re being unfairly taken advantage of. Sometimes the most compassionate thing is to say no, and to help others by letting them stand on their own feet and help themselves. A further piece of good news is that compassion is also, according to the Buddhist teachings, part of our standard equipment. It comes as naturally to us as breathing, as long as we’re not involved in ego trips. So we don’t need to overthink things. As long as you’re practicing the Buddhist teachings, then your compassion is probably gradually growing stronger as you move ever more into a fully sane way way of life. The teachings have the effect of softening your heart, and people with soft hearts do compassionate things."},{"prompt":"What's the most creative way you've seen someone discipline their children?","completion":"Short timeouts with only one prior warning (<<stop digging through the trash or you’ll be in a timeout>>), timing them with the second hand on my watch, and always telling the child how long the timeout would be right at the start (then sticking only to that unless some seconds need added for wrestling / biting / whatever), also helped a great deal. My kids quickly grew into respectful individuals. Also, I wasn’t particularly strict, allowing a lot of “natural consequences” (ok, you don’t want to wear your coat in the snow? fine, but we’re only staying out ten minutes, then a cup of cocoa and a blanket when they come inside wet and cold, yet also realizing that jackets are nice in winter). Mild natural consequences (where possible) are actually an even better teacher than timeouts… but back to my first answer: Starting from a very young age, ten seconds, held sitting on lap in a light bear hug around the child’s upper arms. By age 3 or 4 their timeouts can be upgraded to 30 seconds, and conditions added such as “please start cleaning your room or timeout” (let any effort count, encourage and help (put toys in box together, &c): best way, both through my research prior to firstborn, and also through experience: pls listen peeps these tips really work, herzlich grüessli),. Clint Allen a tip i came up with on my own that works really well for motivation to do chores, based on positive encouragement (and this is best started with side-by-side parent/child work-together at a young age), i call it “start a fire”: example: room cleaning: … oh my goodness, son / daughter, you’re putting those toys in the box so fast i’m starting to see smoke! keep it up &c &c yes it really works"},{"prompt":"Why are dogs afraid of Diwali fire crackers?","completion":"Yes, [LINKED_TEXT: dogs] [URL: https://onebarkplaza.com/] are afraid of firecrackers.

Many examples of vector spaces can be realized conveniently as subspaces of other vector spaces. A vector space over a field F, is a set V with addition satisfying associative and commutative laws, having an additive identity denoted 0, such that each member of V has an additive inverse. Moreover, there is a scalar multiplication that allows members of V to be multiplied by members of F, usually denoted as bv for the product of b in F multiplying v in V. The members of F are called scalars and F is called the scalar field. The multiplication must satisfy the distributive laws over addition of vectors and over addtion of scalars, and 1v=v, where 1 in F is the multiplicative identity. The associative law for multiplication by scalars must also be satisfied. Thus, to show a given set with given addition rule and scalar multiplication rule forms a vector space requires the verification of these rules or laws just mentioned. We say W is a vector subspace of V if it is a subset of V with v+w in W whenever v and w are both in W, and if bw belongs to W, for any b in F and any w in W. Then all the rules for a vector space are automatically true for W because they are true in V. Thus once you are in a vector space, all the subspaces are also vector spaces, you do not need to waste time checking all the associative, commutative, and distributive laws and checking on existence of additive inverses. If S and T are any sets, then T^S denotes the set of all functions from S into T, that is T to the power S. As an example, if V is any vector space over F and S is any set, then H=V^S, that is V to the power S, is the set of all functions from S into V. If f and g are in H and b is in F, then f+g and bf are defined by (f+g)(s)=f(s)+g(s), (bf)(s)=b(f(s)), for all s in S. It is easy to see that H here is then a vector space. In case S=U is also a vector space, then f in H is said to be LINEAR, provided that f(u+w)=f(u)+f(w) and f(bu)=b(f(u)), for all u,w in U and for any b in F. Let L(U;V) denote the set of all linear maps of U into V. Then it is easy to see that L(U;V) is a vector subspace of H. More generally, if U(x) is a vector space for each x in the set X, and if B is the set union of all these vector spaces, then we can let P be the set of all functions s:X→B such that s(x) is in U(x) for each x in X. Then the addition and scalar multiplication rules for H easily work in P as well. We call P the PRODUCT of all the vector spaces U(x), for x in X. In case X={1,2,3,…,n}, We write P=U(1)xU(2)xU(3)x•••xU(n). If s is in P in this case we write s=(s(1),s(2),s(3),…,s(n)). If f is in V^P, then f is a function of n vector variables and we say that f is n-linear or multilinear if it is linear in each variable when all the other variables are held fixed. We use L(U(1),U(2),U(3),…U(n);V) to denote the subset of V^P consisting of the multilinear maps. It is easily seen to be a subspace of V^P, and so is itself a vector space. For example, the scalar multiplication for V is a 2-linear or bilinear map on FxV to V. The addition map ADD:VxV→V is easily seen to be a linear map in L(VxV;V). As another example of a linear map, if x is in X, we can define e(x):P→U(x) by e(x)(s)=s(x), for each s in P. We call e(x) an evaluation map. If W is any vector space, then we see that f:W→P is linear if and only if its composition with e(x), e(x)f:W→U(x) is linear for each x in X. Finally, if f:S→T is any function from set S to set T, we denote by Graph(f) its GRAPH defined as Graph(f)={(s,t): t=f(s)}, a subset of SxT. Then a useful fact you can easily check is that in case U and V are vector spaces and f:U→V is any set function, then f is linear if and only if Graph(f) is a subspace of UxV. Also, if f:S→T is any set function and A is a subset of S, then we denote by f(A) the set f(A)={f(a): a in A} which is a subset of T. We call f(A) the image of A in T under f. If B is a subset of T then its inverse image under f is the subset of S consisting of all s in S such that f(s) is in B. If f is linear say f in L(U;V), then the image of any subspace of U under f is easily seen to be a subspace of V, and the inverse image of any subspace of V is easily seen to be a subspace of U. In particular, the inverse image of zero is called the kernel of f and the image of U in V is called the range of f, so the kernel of f is a subspace of U and the range of f is a subspace of V."},{"prompt":"w we can cover our worried if the product quality we had order are not as per seller information before?

Supply lines in forested areas are not very effective, so it helps a lot if the front-line soldiers can restock ammo right there. If we’d switch to using NATO ammo, we’d lose this crucial advantage. (Also 5.56 is not good in densely forested areas, because I’m told that the bullets can go off course even from the slightest touch to twigs and branches. 7.62x39 doesn’t care about twigs and can punch through a typical Finnish tree — of which there are plenty for the Russian to hide behind.)"},{"prompt":"Does Canada feel animosity towards the Trump administration for the threats and tariffs of the last two years?","completion":"What are they going to do about it if they do?"},{"prompt":"w do you know that you have found a true friend?","completion":"You know I believe that it's a hard task trying to find out who is really your best friend.

He had something called [LINKED_TEXT: Marfan syndrome] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marfan_syndrome] that resulted in him losing his sight completely when he was in his early 20s. I worked for him in the early 1990s, developing a screen reader for Windows 3.1. He owned a company called Automated Functions, Inc, that developed hardware and software for blind people. One of his first products was a hardware box called VERT, which stood for \\"Verbal Emulation in Real Time\\". The box was about the size of a typical desktop PC, and was originally designed to be plugged in between a mainframe and a terminal. It would watch the traffic between the two and then convert that to speech. It could speak upwards of 400 words per minute, which is where he kept it. As others have said, he had an incredible memory. One of my first projects working for him right out of college was on his DOS-based screen reader. I had been working on it all morning and couldn't figure something out. I went and asked him about what a particular function did and he was able to remember it nearly line-for-line, although he probably hadn't looked at it in months. Before Ron started AFI, he worked at the NSA in computer security and had some great stories about how the programmers there would basically try to hack each other to find holes in early versions of Unix. I worked in the field of accessibility for about 8 years, eventually going to Microsoft and working on the accessibility features that are built into Windows. During that time I met many blind programmers. They used a variety of different techniques and tools - but most use standard keyboards and speech output. There are braille keyboards, but not many people use them day-to-day. Braille keyboards have nine main keys - four for each hand plus the space bar, and letters are entered by pressing chords - multiple keys at a time, corresponding directly to the dots in the Braille alphabet. As others have mentioned, there are also braille displays that use piezoelectric actuators to raise and lower plastic bumps. They were extremely expensive though - an 80 column single line display currently retails for about 8000, and I think the prices have dropped in the past 20 years."},{"prompt":"For prochoice folks: If a man's wife or partner learns that she is pregnant and wants an abortion, should the father get a say in the decision if he wants to support and be there for the child?","completion":"Absolutely not.

We are facing a technological implementation that has served to respond to an unattended and unsolvable need for many artists who work on intangible supports and with programming language. The ease of diffusion and distribution of works through the network, together with the ability to create identical copies of these digital files, led in practice to an absolute impossibility of marketing these creations. And the reason rests on the same elements that make up the essence of this market: the absence of a system that would guarantee the authorship of the works and, even more so in this particular case, distinguish an authentic copy from any other that was also accessible to the public, debunked the structural values ​​of this sector, based above all on the unique, exclusive and irreplaceable nature of the work of art. Although non-fungible tokens, since they are based on the same blockchain technology , can be applied to other types of values ​​or assets for which the needs of authenticity and veracity are fundamental, it is in the field of artistic creation where they have found a field. of natural expansion. Through the minting of works, that is, the creation of an NFT work hosted on the blockchain , artists can publicly certify that it is this copy of their digital work and not any other available copy that they consider authentic, unique and true. It should not be forgotten here that, on numerous occasions, the minted works will coexist on the Internet with other identical copies that all users can equally enjoy. However, the conversion of a coin into NFT introduces a qualitative distinction between some copies and others, since it is the author himself who declares that he accepts the minted work as true and not all the other available ones. This seemingly subtle difference is actually an extraordinary conceptual twist. It enables authors to certify their own work and exploit it economically through sale and transfer of ownership. For contemporary digital creation, this technological incorporation marks a before and after in the professional development of many authors who are finally facing a previously utopian reality of being able to monetize their work. In this way, only the minted work, the NFT, will be the authentic piece capable of legal business and with its sale the ownership of the token is transferred. At this point we must clarify that the means of digital creation does not change the configuration of the intellectual property rights that correspond to the author of a work or the powers that assist him to exploit it. The confusion of spheres is understandable, due to the wide diffusion of these works, the ease of access to the contents and the possibility of sharing and reproducing them without limitations."},{"prompt":"What do you think about President Biden's revocation of the Keystone XL Pipeline permit?","completion":"One of his best decisions.

Well, unfortunately to simulate activity and knowledge many if not most developers these days write code in a very similar way even without being paid per LoC. If you look at codebases in almost every company you will find enough boilerplate that led to the joke with FizzBuzz Corporate. A simple example in PHP would be this: <?php /* * Example GET API microservice for items in a shop */ itemId= intval(_GET['id'],0); if (!empty(itemId)) { //THIS IS SQL INJECTION FREE- CHECK THE ITEM ID ASSIGNMENT AND THE SPRINTF sql=sprintf('select * from items where id=%d',itemId); db= mysqli_connect(.....); if (db!== false) { result= mysqli_query(db, sql); found= false; foreach (result as item) { //we will have only ONE item as we pass PK in sql found= true; print json_encode(item); } if (!found) { header(...); //error not found } mysqli_close(db); } else { header(...); //error db not connected } } else { header(...); //error invalid id } For sure this code can be refactored to use functions with 10 more lines at most. The code is secure, easy to test and debug, HAS BEST PERFORMANCE IN THE GIVEN LANGUAGE, has 0 complexity and can be understood at a glance and is self documented. It is scalable at max as it is stateless and can be called in as many threads and on as many servers in parallel as you want. Response time OF A SINGLE THREAD will be less than 1ms which means it can handle 1000 req/s WITH NO SCALING AND THREADS AT ALL. It has dependencies only on mysqli so maybe in 5 years if they deprecate the extension you should change 3 lines. If you change the database that happens once in 10 years you must change exactly 3 lines again. NOW LOOK AT THE SAME API CALL IN ANY PROJECT AROUND WRITTEN WITH SYMFONY, LARAVEL OR ANY FRAMEWORK. IMAGINE THEY EVEN TRY TO SELL THE HEAVY CODE THEY CREATE AS MICROSERVICE. Micro was for small right? The frameworks were supposed to help us build better code faster? Make it more maintainable? Self documented? You need to write much more code scattered in tons of files on top of a complex low performant fragile system that is the framework. I am not against using these. I am just a proponent of using them wisely. A new major version of the framework(1–2 years) means complete rewrite as they deprecate old configs and methods usually. Performance is between tens and thousands of times slower depending on the complexity of the task, memory consumption usually is magnitudes more.

Of course this thing was pre-midi, and having very little knowledge of how to work a monophonic analog synth from the 70’s I thought it was kind of boring (I Had no idea at the time how awesome you could get this thing sounded). Fast forward 2 years and I badly needed and I decided to list this thing on eBay/Craigslist. At the time there were no current auctions and I couldn’t find much about what it was worth or if anyone really even care about this thing. That might sound crazy but this was over 5 years ago, the web wasn’t as saturated then, and from what I found I thought maybe a collector would give me 100 or so for it. I desperately needed a new car so I figured might as well roll the dice. Long story short, I ended up fielding about 50 different bids on eBay and Craigslist and met someone who was in Manhattan on business and sold it for almost 3000. For someone who just finished grad school w/ serious cash flow issues, this was like 30,000 haha. I could write a whole other post about how my friend’s car I borrowed to drive into the city was towed by the corrupt NYPD Traffic Goons (corrupt bc it was unfounded) to Queens during the night before and I had to spend 8 hours going through 3 boroughs paying fines and taking subways and buses out to the farthest reaches of Queens to get it back so I could meet the guy before he left NYC, but that’s another story for another day."},{"prompt":"By what right did Sweden enter NATO without Russia's consent?","completion":"Fucking thick cunt"},{"prompt":"What are some advantages and disadvantages of employers providing sick/vacation leave to their employees?","completion":"As an employment expert, I believe it is important for employers to provide sick vacation leave to their employees for a number of reasons. Firstly, it helps employees take time off for medical issues without having to feel guilty about taking a regular vacation. Secondly, it helps employers retain employees who may be experiencing health problems and may need to take some time off work. Furthermore, it encourages employees to take care of their health, which is beneficial for the whole team.However, there are some drawbacks to employers providing sick vacation leave. For example, some employees may take advantage of the system by using sick leave as a way to take longer vacations than allowed. Moreover, employers may not always be able to give coverage for employees who are out on sick leave, which could lead to an increased workload for co-workers. Finally, some employers may be unwilling to provide the benefit due to financial concerns."},{"prompt":"When I was a child, Smokey Bear said Only YOU can prevent forest fires. I thought he meant ME.

This period shows you maximum opportunity as well as caution signs in your way , you need to identify them in its right sense. This phase is full of energy and curiosity and desires.All these have positive and negative sides. Positive This Energy level will help you in exploring yourself , discovering new adventures . Curiosity will make you more knowledgeable and help you in inventing new strategies for development. Desires will teach you how to be successful , different ways to reach new destinations. Negetive Misusing Energy can lead to negetive roles like dominating, rudeness , overconfidence ( the first step to failure) , trying harmful adventures. Misusing curiosity can lead to trying harmful things, drugs …., When you want to know many things you may not be able to concentrate or prioritise your needful syllabus. Desire. .,….. The most dangerous .In this phase we are too much affected by what our friends say…..trend…..and media life….which may lead to irrational desires or ambitions or dreams which are not in our limits. And striving long for these desires can make you loose valuable things .And in the end when you realise you have failed it leads to depression or low self esteem. Also, this phase develops a great urge for a loving relationship or opp sex partner… So first understand the whole concept of love. Love is a small word which many times people start realising for each other within a small period of time , which they gauge more with the dialogues spoken by their partners and less with reality So let us say love is a whole thing , made up of different components. Understanding , expectations , devotions and caringness…..all these are components of love but to realise them properly you need to go through a number of natural experiences which life gives you. Love is a feeling which is realised instantly but how strong it is and how deep it is , can be verified by the marks you obtain from your experience on these above components. TIPS Decide your targets.Decide what you want to achieve.Understand values of morals and ethics in life.Identify the negetives and positives .Track your steps which direction they are taking you.You may need some experienced people to guide you….may be your parents, teacher or anyone else.You may initially not like suggestions given by elders , because of generation gap , it is common.But you should listen , think twice , then decide whether to follow or unfollow.

While this was difficult enough, she also suffered from dementia with early signs of Alzheimer's. On her good days, when she remembered she was in hostpital, she would beg, plead and cajole us into taking her home. She didn't want to be there (not that anyone really wants to be in hospital). She absolutely hated it! On her bad days, she thought she was already at home and tried to go about her old routine. This caused arguments in our family as to how to treat her when in these not so lucid moments. Some would insist on telling her she was in the hospital, they thought they were doing the right thing. However, when they did, she would totally freak out. I mean really lose it. She would panic, cry hysterically, get angry that she was being called a liar. She wouldn't eat, she refused to sleep. It was at these moments she would try and get out of bed and at times disappeared wondering off trying to find her way to her bedroom. She couldn't get her head around the idea that she wasn't where she thought she was. These family members would also patiently explain that she was ill. That this illness made here mind play tricks on her and that she thought she was at home, but it was her illness, not her. Frankly, this would distress her more. So much more. The idea that she couldn't rely on her mind truly terrified her. She would get so distressed at this. She would ask me if it's true. She would ask me if she was mad/ crazy. I personally couldn't watch her go through that. She was so much more comfortable thinking she was at home. She calmed down, would eat food and sleep much more contentedly. I wasn't going to be the one to take that away from her. She wanted to be home and I assisted in that scenario. I played along.

It was the utter symbol of victory of USSR and fall of Hitler. The photo was put on stamps and posters all over USSR. But it was altered before publication. On the original photo one of the soldiers had watches on both his hands. So, it’s not exactly misunderstood, but it does seem meaningful that the photo which was used to symbolize communist victory over Hitler had among its heroes the soldier who proudly wore stolen watches. A one, who seemed to benefit materially from the conflict primarily showed as an ideological one. Also: there is a half legend that the first flag that was put on Reichstag was a Polish one (from the Polish Army entering together with Soviets). It was supposedly taken off right away after some fights (some say even a shoot-out) between Poles and Russians. Some people who were there on this day say it did happened, some say it didn’t.

Your church, the Sierra Club, the local Police Benevolent Association, the school book fair, Amnesty International, the ACLU - giving them money is a vote in favor of their positions and the way they conduct their mission.Consumer action.

The insidious one. When you’re shopping for appliances, do you always go for what’s cheapest? You voted to offshore more manufacturing jobs to China. Do you buy lots of stuff through Amazon?

In Borderlands, players take on the role of a Vault Hunter, a treasure hunter who travels to the planet Pandora in search of Vaults, which are said to contain vast amounts of treasure. Along the way, they must battle bandits, monsters, and other dangers. Craig of the Creek is a Cartoon Network cartoon about a group of friends who explore the titular creek, a magical place where anything is possible. The show is full of humor, adventure, and heart. A crossover between the two properties could see Craig and his friends travel to Pandora in search of a Vault.

Additionally, they have specific social and behavioral needs that must be met to ensure their well-being.

Even in rural areas, there may be restrictions on how many animals you can keep and what types of animals are allowed. If you are considering a horse, cow, or donkey as a pet, it is important to do your research and make sure you are prepared to provide for their needs.

Are they actually trained to take down threats? What weapons do they have?","completion":"Trained to take down threats definitely. Although as it stands the met police are constantly outside Buckingham palace with armed weapons. The SA80s carried by the guadsmen arent loaded however, but don’t let this distract you from the fact the guards are some of the best infantry soldiers the British Army has to offer besides the paras, although there is the guards parachute platoon ;). If it really came to it they could definitely take down a threat, never seems to get to that though, mostly ends like the 100s of videos on youtube where someone is told to make way.

This has significant consequences to the thrust delivered by the booster as Raptor V1 “only” delivered 185 tonnes of thrust compared to the V2 which delivers 230 tonnes. This is difference of 5,365 tonnes compared to 7,590 tonnes, a not insignificant variation in the thrust delivered. 29 Raptor V1 engines under B4, the centre 9 engines gimbal in order to give directional authority. Render of the 33 engine arrangement sitting on the launch pad showing the 13 engine cluster within the ring of 20 fixed (non gimbaling) engines. The new V2 Raptors are substantially simpler and easier to manufacture than the prototype V1 engines, as well as delivering 24% more thrust. The other obvious development is the way in which the centre engine COPVs are housed. B4 simply mounted the cylinders side by side around the engine skirts, and fitted boxy aerocovers over them for protection. B7 on the other hand mounts the centre engine COPVs in a long thin vertical arrangement that is covered up by triangular strakes that have an aerodynamic function. These act to change the centre of aerodynamic resistance of the booster in the lower half where the engine mass is located, and allows significantly better cross range performance when returning the booster to the landing site. Needless to say, they also offer much less aerodynamic resistance than the ungainly 1st effort on B4. Other changes are less obvious, but equally important, such as the change to external lugs on the booster hull for catch arm engagement rather than sockets, changes to the thrust section construction where 3 x 1.8m ring sections have been swapped out for 4 x 1.4m rings, giving a slight increase in booster length (just 0.2m, or 8 inches), and the increase in stiffening stringer length. Other internal changes are the redesign of the lox header tank, which is now a coaxially mounted structure at the base at the thrust puck, wrapping around the methane downcomer feed pipe instead of a long cylindrical tank attached to the lox tank inner wall. There are no doubt many other upgrades over the earlier prototypes, but these are the ones that are obvious and easily verified to an outside observer. What are the new innovations in the Booster 7 prototype of SpaceX’s Super Heavy rocket?"},{"prompt":"f you were handed an envelope with the time and date of your death, would you open it?","completion":"Nope.

Is it primarily to learn or to acquire credentials for a future job?","completion":"This is a very good question, and different people will give you wildly different answers, largely based upon whether they are products of a liberal arts education program or a technical/professional preparatory education program. “Liberal arts education” is often mistaken to be an education in the humanities. Rather, it is the classical structure of education developed by natural philosophers beginning with Aristotle. It relies heavily on discourse and logical communication, and presumes that an “educated person” will have a wide body of general knowledge and the mental training to parse new data into their knowledge structure. A liberal arts education teaches students how to learn, and how to communicate what they’ve learned by writing about it. A technical education is often mistaken to be an education in computers or machines. Rather, it is an education strategy that relies on field-specific competencies, usually to prepare a student for future professional training, such as medical school. It is a holdover of guild training, where credentials are a description of one’s competency and ability to work. For example, a journeyman would be a skilled worker employed by master craftsman. For a medical doctor, residency=journeyman, and for a researcher, post-doc=journeyman. Obviously both strategies have strengths and weaknesses, and a quality education will integrate aspects of both. An expert should have a fundamental ability to communicate logically about many topics, but also extensive technical knowledge and competency in his/her own field."},{"prompt":"What is onpage SEO?","completion":"On-page SEO refers to the optimization techniques applied directly on a webpage to improve its search engine visibility and user experience. It involves refining various elements within the webpage to align with search engine algorithms and user expectations. Keyword optimization is a fundamental aspect, where relevant keywords are strategically placed in the title, headings, content, and meta tags. Crafting high-quality and engaging content is essential, catering to both search engines and users. Structuring content with appropriate headings (H1, H2, etc.) not only enhances readability but also signals content hierarchy to search engines. Page loading speed directly impacts user satisfaction and search rankings, so optimizing images, leveraging browser caching, and minimizing unnecessary scripts is crucial. Ensuring mobile responsiveness is equally vital as mobile-friendliness is a key factor in search engine ranking algorithms. Meta tags, including meta descriptions and title tags, provide concise information about the page's content, influencing click-through rates from search results. Internal linking enhances user navigation and distributes link equity throughout the website. Optimizing URLs, making them descriptive and short, aids in both search engine comprehension and user understanding. Schema markup helps search engines understand the context of the content, resulting in rich snippets in search results. Lastly, regular monitoring, analysis, and improvement of on-page elements based on user behavior and search engine updates ensure sustained visibility and relevance. In essence, on-page SEO optimizes individual web pages to align with both search engine algorithms and user preferences, enhancing the chances of higher rankings, increased organic traffic, and improved user engagement."},{"prompt":"Where can one find the best biryani in bangalore?","completion":"One of the oldest n busiest in the crowded part of Bangalore, near Majestic, sourashtrapet, you can find Donne Biriyani as early as morning 8 am, it is SGS Non-Veg (Gundu Pulav)"},{"prompt":"attending your youngest daughter's wedding in direct violation of a protective/restraining order a bad idea even if you have a wellrehearsed apology speech attheready?","completion":"If there is and protective/restraining order against you to be in contact or even near her, I assume you won’t even get an invitation to any wedding what-so-ever.

The answer is yes. For every [math]n[/math], there are infinitely many solutions to [math]a^2+b^2=c^n[/math] where [math]a,b,c[/math] are pairwise coprime. By proving this, we will also obtain a procedure to generate all possible solutions. Consider any [math]u,v in Z^+[/math] such that [math]gcd(u,v)=1[/math] and [math]u,v[/math] have opposite parity. Now consider the Gaussian integer [math]u+iv[/math] and its conjugate [math]u-iv[/math]. Since [math]gcd(u+iv,u-iv)=gcd(u+iv,2u)[/math] and [math]gcd(N(u+iv),N(2u))[/math] [math]=gcd(u^2+v^2,4u^2) =1[/math], we have that [math]u+iv[/math] and [math]u-iv[/math] are coprime. Let [math](u+iv)^n=a+ib[/math] and [math]u^2+v^2=c[/math]. We see that [math](u-iv)^n=a-ib[/math] and [math]displaystyle begin{align} a^2+b^2 &= (a+ib)(a-ib) & = (u+iv)^n (u-iv)^n &= ((u+iv)(u-iv))^n &= (u^2+v^2)^n implies a^2+b^2 &=c^n end{align} tag*{}[/math] If [math]a[/math] and [math]b[/math] shared a prime factor, this would result in [math]a+bi[/math] and [math]a-bi[/math] also sharing a prime factor, however we have unique prime factorization in the Gaussian integers which means that [math](u+iv)^n=a+ib[/math] and [math](u-iv)^n=a-ib[/math] are also coprime. Therefore, [math]a[/math] and [math]b[/math] are coprime as desired, which would also immediately imply that [math]a,b,c[/math] are pairwise coprime. (If you take norms, you can further see that [math]a[/math] and [math]b[/math] have opposite parity). The converse is also true for [math]n gt 1[/math]. Every primitive solution (where [math]gcd(a,b)=1[/math]) is generated by this procedure. To see this, first notice that [math]a[/math] and [math]b[/math] cannot both be odd (consider the equation modulo [math]4[/math]). Again by the above argument [math]a+ib[/math] and [math]a-ib[/math] are coprime, and since their product is an [math]n[/math]th power, so are [math]a+ib[/math] and [math]a-ib[/math] (upto multiplication by units, but we can just multiply by [math]i[/math] or [math]-1[/math] and still retain this parametrization). Now [math]a pm bi =(u pm vi)^n[/math], where [math]u,v[/math] are coprime and have opposite parity. (In the case of [math]n=1[/math], there is the extra case of [math]r^2+s^2=t[/math] where [math]r[/math] and [math]s[/math] are odd). In fact, every solution to [math]a^2+b^2=c^n[/math] can be generated from the above procedure using the mappings [math](u,v) mapsto (a,b,c)[/math] and [math](r,s) mapsto (r,s,t)[/math]. Every nonzero solution [math](a,b,c)[/math] (upto sign) can be parametrized as (for [math]k in Z^+[/math]): [math]n[/math] is even: [math](k^{frac n2}a, k^{frac n2}b, kc)[/math] and the trivial solutions [math](k^{frac n2}, 0, k)[/math] and [math](0, k^{frac n2}, k)[/math].[math]n[/math] is odd: [math](k^na,k^nb,k^2c)[/math] and [math](k^nt^{frac {n-1}{2}}r,k^nt^{frac {n-1}{2}}s,k^2t)[/math] To get all solutions, include the solutions you get when you replace [math]amapsto-a[/math], [math]b mapsto -b[/math] and when [math]n[/math] is even, [math]c mapsto -c[/math], and of course the trivial solution [math](0,0,0)[/math]. (If you're wondering why go through all this when we can also get all solutions if we just eliminate the conditions on [math]u,v[/math] above, the advantage is that this parametrization produces a bijective correspondence. In other words, we are guaranteed to not get the same solution twice in this procedure). Some examples of primitive solutions: [math]n=2:(a,b)=(u^2-v^2, 2uv)[/math] [math]displaystyle u+iv=4+3i implies 7^2+24^2=25^2[/math][math]n=3:(a,b)=(u^3-3uv^2,3u^2v-v^3)[/math] [math]displaystyle u+iv=4+i implies 47^2+52^2=17^3[/math][math]displaystyle n=4:(a,b)=(u^4-6u^2v^2+v^4,4u^3v-4uv^3)[/math] [math]displaystyle u+iv=3+2i implies 119^2+120^2=13^4[/math][math]displaystyle n=5:(a,b)=(u^5-10u^3v^2+5uv^4,5u^4v-10uv^3+v^5)[/math] [math]displaystyle u+iv=1+2i implies 41^2+38^2=5^5[/math]"},{"prompt":"A 500 ft. train travelling 500 ft per minute must travel through a 500 ft long tunnel.

The causes of landslides in the Himalayan region and Western Ghats can be differentiated as: Plate Movement: •Himalayan region is tectonically active as the Indian Plate is moving towards the north at the rate of 5 cm/year, that causes frequent tremor and isostatic imbalances. •Western Ghats are tectonically more stable as compared to the Himalaya. External forces: •The Himalayan region is the source of many rapid flowing rivers such as the Ganges, the Indus, the Brahmaputra etc. which cause a large scale erosion of mountainous region which is also a cause of landslide. •In the Western Ghats, perennial rivers are rare. Types of rock: • The Himalayan region is composed of a sedimentary rocks which are more prone to denudation and erosion as compared to the other rocks. • While, the major part of Western Ghats is composed of a basalt rocks which shows great resistance to erosion and denudation.

Can I get you a drink? Great. Now, you asked my opinion about Quora? You didn’t? Oh well, too bad, you are going to get it anyway. First, the moderators. Despite what others may tell you, I have no complaints. Yes, the bots get it wrong most of the time, but when I have appealed, I have had a satisfactory response, and with surprising alacrity. Now, other Quorans. I have met people here whom I regard as friends, and I welcome the idea of getting together with them, so a bit of organised support in this would be great. I think you should reinstate the “Top Writers” program. It seems to have died without notice, and the subscription to the NYT was very welcome. You could have sold me a tee shirt, and maybe some other Quora “stuff,” too. Another good idea that died on the vine. Can I get you another drink? And finally, and if you agree to this I will pick up the dinner tab. It is simple. Kill the QPP program. Kill it with fire, pound a stake through its fetid and rotten heart. chop it into pieces with a blunt axe, and sink the pieces in the deepest oceans! And while you are at it, take the heads of the QPP scammers, who ask inane repeated questions, and impale them on pikes outside your corporate offices, where crows will pick their eyes out.

A traditional Indian girl who has come to America to study and follow her dreams. Imagine meeting a guy like two days ago and he wants to Americanize you by telling you to stop wearing traditional clothes to enhance your beauty. So therefore he takes you to the mall to help you buy western clothes that will make you look attractive. You select a black dress, but he says you should go for grey instead as black doesn't suit you. But you are a rebel and wear that black dress to stun him, just so he can compliment you. He sends a proposal to your house afterwards but you deny it since your focus in life is not matrimony right now. You fight with him since he didn't ask you first before sending your family over. He even tries to bribe you by telling you that if you were to get married to him, you would have been his partner in his company which in reality is his father's company. You fight with him and tell him that you are going to achieve your own goals and succeed yourself. In return all he says is that he wanted a simple wife and life. He claims to not like you for what you are now even though he is to be blamed for the changes or else you were good. He even says your not the same girl he met even but he was the one who told you to be more modern and independent. What is something you don't understand? This. This whole scenario is something I don't understand. People change you and then they don't like you for the person you have become.

Mining (and staking as well) commissions or transaction fees are small amounts of cryptocurrencies assigned to miners to process a transaction. These small payments reward the miners and stakers for the work done. All new transactions on the blockchain are recorded in blocks at regular intervals. The first record of all new transactions is made by the miner who managed to get the next coin. In addition, he also receives a reward for this operation.

I would also hazard a guess, that you mean can a user using VPN be traced. The answer to that is a resounding Yes. VPN is only a facet of multiple aspects through which a user can be tracked. Contrary to the hype these days, it is not a one stop solution to privacy concerns. All VPN traffic eventually passes through the VPN providers servers, which can log whatever it is your accessing. Most VPN services assist law enforcement agencies in case their services are used unlawfully. Read the fine print in ToS carefully. Cookies are another way a user can be tracked even if you are on a VPN connection. Additionally, browser fingerprinting can be used to track a user across websites without cookies or VPNs. It is much more effective than cookies because fingerprinting can pass on screen resolution, operating system, browser plugin information to any website requesting for such information. So, yes, without even sophisticated methods, a VPN user can be tracked relatively easily."},{"prompt":"w do people who eat only once or twice a day manage to not feel hungry between meals?","completion":"unger Management Strategies How do people who eat only once or twice a day manage to not feel hungry between meals? People who eat only once or twice a day and manage to not feel hungry between meals typically adopt a few strategies to regulate their hunger levels. Here are some possible explanations for how they achieve this: Fat adaptation: When individuals consume fewer meals and adopt a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet, their bodies can become more efficient at burning stored fat for energy. This metabolic state, known as ketosis, can lead to reduced hunger and improved satiety. The high fat content in the meals helps to keep them feeling full for longer periods.Intermittent fasting: Some individuals follow intermittent fasting schedules, such as the 16/8 method, where they fast for 16 hours and have an eating window of 8 hours. During the fasting period, the body adapts to the reduced meal frequency and adjusts hormone levels, such as ghrelin (the hunger hormone), which helps to suppress appetite.Balanced and nutritious meals: When people eat infrequently, they often prioritize the consumption of nutrient-dense, whole foods in their meals. These foods are rich in fiber, protein, and healthy fats, which promote satiety and keep them feeling fuller for longer periods. Including a variety of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats in each meal can help regulate hunger.Hydration: Drinking an adequate amount of water throughout the day can help reduce feelings of hunger. Sometimes, thirst can be mistaken for hunger, and staying properly hydrated can help alleviate this confusion.Mindful eating: Paying attention to the body's hunger and fullness cues and practicing mindful eating can help individuals better understand their body's needs. This awareness can prevent overeating during meals and promote a healthier relationship with food."},{"prompt":"What are the most underrated cities in the U.S.?","completion":"Once you get beyone the major tourist destinations like Washington DC, NYC San Francisco, etc. it is pretty much evey other city that is under rated.

I think the asker have certain purposes, maybe to question the Iranian history! But the simple answer is “no”! The older Persians couldn’t be darker. They spoke Persian which is an Iranian language. The other related Iranian languages are Kurdish, Gilaki, Baluchi … the speaker of these languages have light and tanned skins. [LINKED_TEXT: Iranian peoples - Wikipedia] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_peoples] spread in a vast area of Iran, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Iraq … In some places like Iraq, Azerbaijan they either were turkified or mixed with some Turkish tribes. I respect their ethnicity but ethnicity is not race or genetic. The genetic of most of the Middle East countries or even Mediterranean countries is close to each other, and it dates back to 10,000 or more years ago. The historical evidence shows countries like Turkmenistan were once full of Iranian people. They either extincted or assimilated to the present people; however the later is more probable. So, saying Iranian were mixed with Turks (As I see in some answers) is like saying Iranian were mixed with Iranians. The better claim is Iranian mixed with Asians. But at least inside the present Iran such mixage didn’t happen. It happened mainly in Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, … Also, I don’t think Iranians (inside Iran) were much mixed with other non-Iranian people (at least from thousands years ago, we don’t know about pre-historic times). In southern parts, a minority were mixed with Africans (less than 10%). The genetics make up of Iranians is as follows ([LINKED_TEXT: Iranian peoples - Wikipedia] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_peoples]): J1-M267; typical of [LINKED_TEXT: Semitic peoples] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitic_peoples], was rarely over 10% in Iranian groups, but as high as 30% in Assyrian minorities of Iran.J2-M172: is the most common Hg in Iran (~23%); almost exclusively represented by J2a-M410 subclade (93%), the other major sub-clade being J2b-M12. Apart from Iranians, J2 is common in Mediterranean and Balkan peoples (Croatians, Serbs, Greeks, Bosnians, Albanians, Italians, Bulgarians, Turks), in the Caucasus (Armenians, Georgia, northeastern Turkey, north/northwestern Iran, Kurds, Persians); whilst its frequency drops suddenly beyond Afghanistan, Pakistan and northern India.[LINKED_TEXT: [117]] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_peoples#cite_note-ReferenceB-118] In Europe, J2a is more common in the southern Greece and southern Italy; whilst J2b (J2-M12) is more common in Thessaly, Macedonia and central – northern Italy. Thus J2a and its subgroups within it have a wide distribution from Italy to India, whilst J2b is mostly confined to the Balkans and Italy,[LINKED_TEXT: [118]] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_peoples#cite_note-119] being rare even in Turkey. Whilst closely linked with Anatolia and the Levant; and putative agricultural expansions, the distribution of the various sub-clades of J2 likely represents a number of migrational histories which require further elucidation.[LINKED_TEXT: [117]] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_peoples#cite_note-ReferenceB-118][LINKED_TEXT: [119]] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_peoples#cite_note-120]R1a-M198: is common in Iran, more so in the east and south rather than the west and north; suggesting a migration toward the south to India then a secondary westward spread across Iran.[LINKED_TEXT: [120]] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_peoples#cite_note-121] Whilst the Grongi and Regueiro studies did not define exactly which sub-clades Iranian R1a haplogrouops belong to, private genealogy tests suggest that they virtually all belong to \\"Eurasian\\" R1a-Z93.[LINKED_TEXT: [121]] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_peoples#cite_note-122] Indeed, population studies of neighbouring Indian groups found that they all were in R1a-Z93.[LINKED_TEXT: [122]] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_peoples#cite_note-123] This implies that R1a in Iran did not descend from \\"European\\" R1a, or vice versa. Rather, both groups are collateral, sister branches which descend from a parental group hypothesized to have initially lived somewhere between central Asia and Eastern Europe.[LINKED_TEXT: [123]] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_peoples#cite_note-124]R1b – M269: is widespread from Ireland to Iran, and is common in highland West Asian populations such as Armenians,Turks and Iranians – with an average frequency of 8.5%. Iranian R1b belongs to the L-23 subclade,[LINKED_TEXT: [124]] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_peoples#cite_note-125]which is an older than the derivative subclade (R1b-M412) which is most common in western Europe.[LINKED_TEXT: [125]] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_peoples#cite_note-126]Haplogroup G and subclades: most concentrated in the southern Caucasus,[LINKED_TEXT: [126]] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_peoples#cite_note-127] it is present in 10% of Iranians.[LINKED_TEXT: [127]] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_peoples#cite_note-Grugni.2C_2012-128]Haplogroup E and various subclades are markers of various northern and eastern African populations. They are present in less than 10% of Iranians. As you can see, Iranian weren’t mixed with Arabs. (I don’t say it is good or bad, and I like and respect Arabs, but I just express the facts), by Arabs I mean people from Arabia, otherwise most Arabic countries like Iraq, Syria,… have similar genetic make up, and that happened again very long ago. J2 is common in Iranians and many Mediterranean, and Balkan countries. Some believe its origin were Zagros mountains in Iran. Anyway, it also occurred 10,000 or more years ago. R1a which is common in Indians and it can be observed in Iranians, but it’s not high in Iranians except Baluchis, or people in southern and eastern part of Iran. (It could be 15% to 20% according to this map : [LINKED_TEXT: Genetic Research] [URL: http://www.transpacificproject.com/index.php/genetic-research/]) It doesn’t mean that Iranians 2500 or more years ago were mainly possessing R1a, and then they mixed with J2. J2 dates back long before that time, also Persian is a western Iranian language not an eastern Iranian language ([LINKED_TEXT: Western Iranian languages - Wikipedia] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Iranian_languages]). R1b is in 10% of Iranians. I don’t know which of these are responsible for the Iranians’ looks. My other reason to say that Iranians weren’t mixed with other people is that Iranian have their distinguishable look. It differs from neighboring countries and it is probably the same look of ancient Persians. For example, the following is a famous Iranian general, Qassem Soleimani, from Kerman province (Center south). And the following is a pic which commonly attributed to Cyrus the Great. Yes, they somewhat resemble Indians as they have long nose and big eyes, or similar to Europeans as they have narrow lips, but we can’t certainly say that ancient Persian were exactly these people or those people. Moreover, any ethnicity who has lived in Iran have share in Iran history. Elamites had a great civilization before Aryan come to the region, and Iran history borrowed many things from them. They could be the present people in some western or southern cities of Iran. Anyway, I can’t see much difference in south, east, west and north part of Iran. We also shouldn’t forget the climate of each region. The North or west could be lighter, but lighter or darker people can be found anywhere."},{"prompt":"What are the characteristics of a genuine person?","completion":"CompassionateHonestLoyalDon't backbite behind someone's backAccept people as they areReady to help someone who is in needAppreciate good workNever hesitate to give compliment"},{"prompt":"Why are so many airlines upset at Emirates Airlines?","completion":"There is a natural process of evolution which takes place in every country ever so slowly, which at first, it may look so favorable, but then with time, one realizes that there is the law of diminishing returns that will start rearing its head.Within any large tribe the skills and trades start to evolve on a family level and many small family and cottage industry seem to earn a living where no one becomes rich but many are efficiently occupied productively with the basics of life for a long time, where the family itself uses the products and barters the rest with the neighbors and no financial system was necessary.With the introduction of mass production, the supermarkets get larger with more turn over.

While in the developed nations, after the workers fight for better salaries and better work conditions, there in the distance, new institutions and establishment are formed which are backed by the luck of nature through the ownership of raw materials including oil. In the old days the British Empire, which was perhaps the latest significant Empire, lost it all because of its own worker's unions and its own Government policies not supporting the productive industries.One feels that the Giant in the Emirates is following the same tendency as happened in many countries in Europe and the USA. Due to their own higher demands of worker's condition related to productivity, things were not as clear as they should have been. The financial game that commenced to be applied at about 1929 in the West, as related to the support of the small cottage industries has now resulted in a few blown up corporate balloons which very slowly cannot take the internal pressure, whatever financial games they play, or whatever industrial agreements they agree upon to keep holding on to the last straw when floating in a stormy market. Emirates may take over a large chunk of the market but any giant can become top-heavy and the center of gravity will not always fall in the footprint on the supporting tired feet."},{"prompt":"w do new owners of big 35 foot or longer class A motorhomes go from driving an everyday car or pickup truck to driving such a giant vehicle?","completion":"35′ is a giant vehicle?

It shows up a number of times during WW2 stories/histories. German troops would pretend to surrender, then when someone came forward to accept their surrender they would throw themselves down and other German troops would open fire. All I can say is that once you’ve done this, you have no complaint when someone else shoots you down when you try to surrender. It’s your fault, you’ve set the rules of engagement."},{"prompt":"Why does the Starliner crew ride in a headsdown position during ascent?","completion":"I’m pretty sure they ride up just like Apollo astronauts.

Isn't there a chance that in a hurricane or weather event that causes a power outage that the natural gas will be shut off as well? Wouldn't this defeat the purpose of it in these events?","completion":"In addition to previous answers, there are “dual fuel” and even “tri fuel” generators that can run on alternatives of natural gas, bottled propane, and gasoline. A supply of propane or gasoline could be kept on hand as secondary backups in case the natural gas supply was disrupted. “Weather” events, as noted, are unlikely to disrupt natural gas supply, but a big earthquake could do it. (A problem with gasoline and propane is that you need to store quite a bit of it to get through more than a day or two if you’ll need to use the generator a lot. Gasoline (or diesel) also can degrade if stored for too long, so if you want real reliability in a disaster, you need to periodically purge and replace those fuels.)"},{"prompt":"What will happen if 1 will be equal to 1 rupee?

If 1 inr becomes equal to 1 usd then it will be bad for a developing country. Take an example if any how 1 inr becomes equal to 1 usd then labour cost, product cost will be more. The investors who invest in India may not agree to invest rather they try to find another place where they will get it more easily in less price. Export will decrease. Beacause the overall product cost will be more. If you think by making 1 usd equals to 1 inr india will be more rich then it is wrong.

What would the justice department seek to do if the state went ahead with their plans anyways? Have many states pushed back against the federal government?","completion":"The only real thing the justice department can do is sue the State. Missouri is going ahead with their plan. The second amendment is about the most misinterpreted amendment there is. So the courts have sort of taken a position that the constitution doesn't really apply to the States when it comes to 2A questions while they have decided that theb1st amendment does restrict States. So Missouri is basically legislating that the federal rule does not conform to the Missouri constitution nor does it follow the second amendment so it is prohibiting state and local law enforcement from cooperation with federal agents to enforce them. Ironically California has a similar law but about immigration laws. Unlike gun rights the constitution expressly puts immigration as a federal jurisdiction. This means California has no constitutional leg to stand on at all because it is the right of the Federal government to make and enforce immigration law. So Missouri basically said we are going to do what California is doing except with gun rights instead of immigration. Missouri has a much stronger legal position and in my assessment would win in court. You never really know for sure how it will play out though. I am old enough to remember when the court in Pennsylvania said there was no standing to challenge new election laws because they hadn't had an election yet and then rendering cases moot after the election because they already happened. Basically the court said you can't say there is harm before the harm and then said the harm already happened so there is nothing we can do about it now. A court will decide what it decides and sometimes it makes no sense."},{"prompt":"it better to take a home loan or to cut some amount from salary every month to make a home?","completion":"I would like to approach the question from a different angle. Usually answer to this kind of question tend to focus on the ability to service the loan, requirement of a house etc. But I would like to highlight the time value of money. Home loans tend to be of long term, some even go up to 25–30 years. People tend to lament on the huge consolidated amount of the monthly interest out go. But most people failed to understand the loss of value of money over long periods, especially in India. The fact is that 100 rupees now have value of only 50 rupees five or six years later. Those who advice against taking a home loan and favours savings now and buy later forgets this basic fact. A home loan should be based on the fact that you have ( or will have) steady and increasing source of income that will remain stable over the period of loan, that your EMI will not fluctuates unless there is a change in the interest rates and that the real value of your EMI get reduced over the years. If you are young, say around 30 years or less, the EMI can be 60 -70% of your monthly disposable income. ( if you are a salaried person, after deducting all the statutory deductions like PF, ESI, IT TDS etc) It your age is more, the proportion should be reduced ( mainly for money to meet your daily family needs). Tenure of the loan can be extended up to your date of retirement. The qantum of the loan should be arrived at based on the EMI and tenure. Accordingly say you fixed the loan amount as 50.00 Lakh and the EMI is arrived at 30000.00. The EMI is 60% of your monthly salary. With the persistent inflation, your salary will increase every year at least by 3 to 5%, because of increments and DA adjustments, or through annual appraisals. But the EMI will remain unchanged unless there is a change in the interest rate. In a few years the percentage of EMI to salary will get reduced to 55%, 50%, 45% etc in 10 to 15 years in will be less than one third of your salary at that time. If you have any doubt of the stability of the income over the life of the loan, then do not take this risk. Assess your income and risk of loss of the job and reduce the loan. Otherwise if the loan is defaulted your “dream home” will end up in the auction table of the bank. On the other hand if you accepted the argument of savings over loan, most often your “dream home” most likely to remain as a dream because the inflation will keep the price of the “dream home” increasing every year and your savings will never catch up with it. There is practically no savings method that can yield at a rate higher than the rate of inflation.

(1) In 2010 the IMF lent Euro 30 billion to Greece as part of a much larger package to support the ailing economy. The IMF explained at the time that it had lent 3200% of quota, well over its normal limits for a country in difficulty. It gave Greece “exceptional access to IMF resources”. The IMF cited the need to prevent the crisis spreading to other parts of the EU and to defend the Euro. In 2012 the IMF decided to lend Greece a new Euro 28bn as part of a replacement loan package. It drew attention this time to a “significant large competitiveness gap” (stronger language than 2010) and to a high level of public debt. This time it agreed with a major write down of privately held Greek public sector debt (75% written off) and required cuts in the minimum wage as part of its measures to improve competitiveness. Once again Greece received special treatment with a large loan. I queried why the IMF would do this for a country which is no longer sovereign in monetary and economic matters, as its status with the Euro prevents a normal IMF recovery package. (2) The International Monetary Fund says Greece missed a 1.8 billion debt payment Tuesday, becoming the first developed country to default on a loan to the lending agency.Eurozone finance chiefs refused to grant a last-minute extension of the bailout program Greece has relied on for five years, and the Greek government couldn't come up with money on its own to pay the IMF. The IMF said its executive board would consider a Greek request to extend the loan. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has called a referendum Sunday in which Greek voters can decide whether to approve a deal proposed by the country's creditors. A \\"No\\" vote would likely force Greece to stop using the euro currency. The last country to miss an IMF loan payment was Zimbabwe in 2001. (3) The IMF has been charging an effective interest rate of 3.6% on its loans to Greece. This is far more than the interest rate the institution needs to meet all its costs, currently around 0.9%. If this was the actual interest rate Greece had been paying the IMF since 2010, it would have spent €2.5 billion less on payments.Out of its lending to all countries in debt crisis between 2010 and 2014 the IMF has made a total profit of €8.4 billion, over a quarter of which is effectively from Greece. All of this money has been added to the Fund’s reserves, which now total €19 billion. These reserves would be used to meet the costs from a country defaulting on repayments. Greece’s total debt to the IMF is currently €24 billion.

Proxies also let you bypass geolocation protections by using proxies in a specific country since companies enforce geolocation restrictions to block countries or regions to avoid traffic overload on their website. The two main proxy categories are datacenter and residential. Datacenter proxies run on servers operated in big data centers. This makes them easier to identify than residential proxies, which are installed on end-user devices like mobile phones, laptops, or televisions. Datacenter proxies are faster, more stable and way cheaper than residential and other proxy types, so you should always use them first, and only ever use residential proxies when there's no other way - when datacenter proxies are heavily blocked by the website you want to scrape. The best way to find out whether datacenter proxies are going to work for you is trial and error. Try scraping the website with datacenter proxies. If it works, you’ve just saved yourself a shedload of money. You need to try datacenter proxies with more than 1 request to know if they’ll work for you.

My own reaction to the question was, I suppose, a short list of questions. What about volatile toxins or vapors that exude from plastics. They are very diffuse, but probably not good for you. Possibly, you should not have consumed the first charge of water placed in it. Possibly “no times” is the best answer. It would depend on how much you trust the corporation that made the bottle, or that charged it with the first serving of water. Do you think they had your best health in mind? Do you think the chemists who designed the plastic wanted to make something that was safe for repeated use, or were they designing something that only needed to be “relatively safe” for single use? I would think that would be the case. I would be wary of using something multiple times if I new it was made by people who didn’t really think things through. Refill it with what? Water, I suppose. But I have also put humming-bird food, gasoline, hot water (to use it as a hot-water bottle), ice (to use it as an ice pack) into various plastic bottles that were originally intended as single-use bottle. None of those versions of “usable” would work if it had a hole in it. So, in that case, it would be usable until it has a hole in it. But then what? Well, it could be “recycled” and made into building materials. Plastic bottles are never really “recycled” in the real meaning of the word.

Mayhem is a black metal group from Norway, formed in 1984 and re-formed in 1994 after a hiatus. The members of this band……let\`s just say they represent(ed) all the bad stereotypes of metalheads. When your friendly neighborhood scared Christian mom talks about “devil worshippers”, these guys say “you mean us”? In 1988, after a series of exits from the group, Swedish vocalist Per Yngve Ohlin, a.k.a “Dead” joined the band. Dead continued the goth music tradition arguably begun by Alice Cooper of donning black and white corpse paint for live shows, although bandmates claimed he didn\`t do it to sell a persona like Cooper and KISS did, rather to actually look like a corpse. During their shows, Dead would cut himself with knives, and the band used real decapitated heads of livestock as props onstage. In April of 1991, Dead committed suicide by slitting his wrists and then shooting himself with a shotgun. He was found by his bandmate Euronymous (Oystein Aarseth), the band\`s guitarist and founder, who took a photo of Dead\`s body and used it as the cover for their next album. However, Dead and Euronymous were not the only clearly disturbed members of the band. Guitarist Varg Vikernes is perhaps the most notorious of all. In 1993, Vikernes fatally stabbed Euronymous after an altercation. He was arrested shortly after and charged with murder as well as church arson; he was also suspected of burning down four churches in Norway in 1992. At this time, Vikernes held far-right political beliefs and embraced Nazism. He has since distanced himself from this movement, but still holds fringe views many consider to be far right-wing. In 2009, Vikernes was paroled and lives with his family in France. So: murder, suicide, Nazism? It\`s everything aforementioned scared Christian mom warned us about, rolled right up into one! Seriously weird, yet fitting, I guess, that all these guys found each other and joined a band together. It is said that Dead committed suicide because he hated how commercial and trendy black metal had become, but given the alternative (these guys), maybe we\`ll take the shock value over the real thing."},{"prompt":"Why are cookies called biscuits in England?","completion":"Why are cookies called biscuits in England?

However, it is important to note that diabetes is a chronic condition that requires proper medical management, including regular monitoring of blood sugar levels, a healthy diet, and regular physical activity. Ayurvedic remedies may be used in conjunction with conventional treatments under the guidance of a qualified healthcare professional. That being said, here are some of the best Ayurvedic medicines for diabetes: 1. Bitter Melon (Momordica charantia): Also known as karela, bitter melon is a popular Ayurvedic remedy for diabetes. It is believed to help lower blood sugar levels by increasing insulin secretion. 2. Cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum): Cinnamon is another Ayurvedic remedy that may help lower blood sugar levels. It contains compounds that improve insulin sensitivity and may also help reduce inflammation. 3. Gymnema (Gymnema sylvestre): Gymnema is an herb that has been traditionally used in Ayurveda to help regulate blood sugar levels. It is believed to work by increasing insulin secretion and reducing sugar absorption in the intestines. 4. Amla (Emblica officinalis): Amla, also known as Indian gooseberry, is a rich source of vitamin C and antioxidants. It may help improve insulin sensitivity and reduce oxidative stress, which can contribute to the development of diabetes complications. 5. Turmeric (Curcuma longa): Turmeric is a spice that is commonly used in Ayurveda. It contains compounds that have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which may help improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of diabetes complications. It is important to note that these Ayurvedic remedies should be used in conjunction with proper medical management and under the guidance of a qualified healthcare professional.

A few suggestions: Just ask. I’ve talked with many authors who’ve been in this situation; some were able to get their contracts canceled if they (the authors) had already met the terms on their end. I would try this regardless of item #2 below because you want this existing book/title completely off the market.Go with Mercedes Lackey’s recommendation and rewrite and republish under a different title. The reality is, by virtue of your book being published with one of these companies, its reputation has essentially been tarnished. Even if you get the rights back and were to publish it another way as is, you’d still have the existing title sitting out there in the market, which could create confusion. Someone could accidentally order the wrong (vanity-pubbed) version. A media person is interested, but then finds it online as a vanity-pubbed book and declines to cover it/you. A book award finds the wrong (again, vanity-pubbed) title and rejects the book from consideration. These are the things that can happen with two books of the same title by the same author. And even if you took the shortcut of just changing the title, Amazon could eventually flag the book as potentially plagiarized because of the existing vanity-pubbed version. You’d have to prove to them you had the rights to publish the new version. (I went through this with a client under a different circumstance.)You don’t have to rewrite 25% of it if you substantially add to the existing version. Mercedes is probably referring to this as well, but I want to make it clear. If yours is a nonfiction book, this is a lot easier. You can add a couple new chapters, update some references, add a bibliography, add a resources section, or other things to make it a “new” book. Also, I’m not sure there’s a hard line with the 25% rule (someone correct me if I’m wrong) — the test is more along the lines of substantially and substantively new. Unfortunately, simply releasing an “expanded and updated edition” is not a good option because it would still have the stink of the existing title. It’s an annoying situation no matter what, but you can get around/through it. And once you do, use your experience to educate others on avoiding these kinds of companies and what to do when they’re in your situation.

It has been the world’s largest arms importer every year since 2010, as its defence industry struggles to keep up with its international ambitions. The volume of major weapons imports more than doubled between 2004-08 and 2009-13 and India’s share of the volume of international arms imports increased from 7% to 14%. A plausible reason for this is that India lacks a defence industry of its own sufficient to meet its external challenges and to keep pace with its expanding strategic interests. The need to modernise has indeed been one major reason for India’s status as top spender on arms imports. But there are other factors at work too. Modernization is imprecise India is still struggling to upgrade its arms manufacturing sector, despite this being a priority for over a decade. Continued reliance on foreign suppliers exposes the lack of a clear-cut vision of its defence industry. Russia continues to be one of India’s most significant strategic partners and biggest arms supplier, grabbing about 75% of its weapons imports. The remaining 25% is made up of the US and Western European countries, particularly France, Britain, and Germany. Though the government has emphasised private firms and public-private partnerships, the Indian defence industry continues to be dominated by the public sector. The Defence Ministry’s stumbles over promoting the private sector, which is still restricted to only 26% in the defence production sector, further constrains and exposes the problem in India’s defence industry planning. India is bad at making strategic friends Indian defence firms continue to struggle with the move from a buyer-seller relationship with foreign firms to one based on equal partnership and joint production. Since the Cold War, India has tried to increase its arms imports from the US and Western Europe as part of a broader strategy of diversifying suppliers. This works both ways: the US defence industry is very happy to find new buyers and new technologies. American defence giants such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing have been exploring potential business partners in India, attracted by the low-cost, well-educated, English speaking, and technically sound workforce. But India and our government haven’t relished this strategic opportunity from the west, which is why there’s we’re only buying. Our crippled indigenous setup Relying on imports from first-tier arms producing countries has positives and negatives. On one hand, it has ensured and enhanced India’s defence capability, but on the other it has constrained indigenous research as technology has been imported rather than developed. Though these arms purchases are done with technology transfer and offset arrangements, India still lags behind the developed country’s defence industry standards. Noisy neighbours So what are all these arms for? India faces two primary enemies – Pakistan and China – and what worries its government most is the prospect of its two rivals uniting to form a hostile nuclear and defence partnership. This isn’t just scaremongering: 54% of Chinese arms exports already go to Pakistan. In the face of this threat, India feels it still needs to power up its arms acquisitions to deal with its shortage of fighter jets, submarines, helicopters, howitzers. For example, the Indian Air Force is left with 34 fighter squadrons when at least 44 would be required to deter the dual challenge of Pakistan and China. Great ambitions Geopolitical factors are also driving India to focus on importing arms. Since the country declared itself a nuclear power in 1998, India’s political and defence elites have reached a consensus on the idea that India must march towards great power status. A growing economy further supports the focus on powering up its defence as does the “push factor” of Chinese rivalry and the “pull” of the US’ rebalancing strategy towards Asia-Pacific. As one account of India’s military modernization puts it, the country is “arming without aiming”. Without a serious effort to reinvent its strategy, India risks wasting the money it is ploughing into its military. Excellent progress has been made in missile technology and a space program, but more must be done to ensure effective public-private partnerships, joint-production with foreign firms, and the growth of India’s own industry. For the time being, little will change. Security threats to the north and west, the need to develop an indigenous defence industry and its aspirations for great power status will see India continue to top the arms importer list in the coming years, and China is not making any such mistakes, hence their far better defence production.

Corporate setups that require more hands on assistance & training choose SAS as an option. As per researchers & Statisticians choose R it helps in heavy calculations as they say [LINKED_TEXT: R] [URL: https://bit.ly/2rIc4tG] was meant for Job done & not to ease your computers. [LINKED_TEXT: Python ] [URL: https://bit.ly/1uFNyUX]has been the best choice for startups today due to its lightweight nature & growing community. Let us see some parameters and rating. The information below is to choose the best one and I give a score to each of these 3 languages- Background SAS- It has been the undisputed market leader in commercial analytics space. The Software offers huge array of statistical functions has good GUI for the people to learn quickly & provides technical support. It ends up being the most expensive option & always enriched with statistical functions. Python-It is a multi purpose, free & open source programming language and become very popular in Data Science due to its active community & Data Mining Libraries. R-It is a free & open source programming language used to perform advanced data analysis tasks. Because of its open source nature, latest technology get released quickly and it is very cost effective option. Industries were the tool is used- [LINKED_TEXT: SAS] [URL: https://bit.ly/2OBPv4x] is being preferred by big corporations because they offered highly reputed customer service, which is why SAS has an advantage in the marketing companies & financial sectors, cost is not the primary concern for selecting a tool. R & [LINKED_TEXT: Python] [URL: https://bit.ly/2IcTK2W] are used by Startups and mid sized firms. Telecom & tech companies require huge volumes of unstructured data to be analyzed. Hence Data Scientists use ML techniques for which Python & R are more suitable. Availability / Cost- SAS is a commercial software, it is expensive & still beyond reach for most of the professionals. It holds the highest market share in private organizations. R and Python are free software that can be downloaded by anyone. Ease of Learning You don’t require prior knowledge to learn SAS, because it is easy to use GUI & makes it the easiest to learn of all the 3. To analyze data in Python you will use Data Mining Libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, & Scipy. The code you write in these libraries it looks similar to the code you write in R. Hence it is easier to learn Python for Data Science when you are already familiar with R. Job Scenario- SAS is the market leader in available corporate jobs, most of the big organizations, still work on SAS. R and Python are better options for startups & companies looking for cost efficiency, no. of jobs R and Python have been increased over the last few years. These are my views on this comparison. Hope you like it.

Led Zeppelin was the soundtrack for my teenage years. having said that we have to understand he- and Clapton and Beck- are in their mid 70’s and sadly any chance of them touring are dwindling fast, if not never again. With his body of work over the years he owes us nothing. His legacy as one of greatest rock guitarists ever is undisputed. For a lifelong Zeppelin fan (i still listen to them to this day) my feeling is Page’s career started with Led Zeppelin 1 and “you shook me” where he played one of the prettiest blues solos he ever played and ended with Outrider and “prison blues”, again one of the raunchiest, pure blues tune you’ll ever hear. Sort of like his life has come full circle back to what he started out as…a great, innovative, supremely talented blues rock guitarist. I’m simply glad to have what he’s created more than wondering what else he could do."},{"prompt":"Which university is better for BSCS in Lahore, Comsats or PUCIT?","completion":"FaST"},{"prompt":"What is the difference between Angular and AngularJS?","completion":"Angular 2.0 released by Ng-team recently, and within a month it’s created a buzz in AngularJs community. Angular 2 is 5 times faster as compared to Angular 1. Angular 2 will be a huge learning curve for developers. It is written entirely in Typescript and meets the ES6 specification. Difference between Angular 1.x Vs Angular 2 1). Angular 2 is mobile oriented & better in performance. Angular 1.x was not built with mobile support in mind, where Angular 2 is mobile oriented. Angular 2 is using Hierarchical Dependency Injection system which is major performance booster. Angular 2 implements unidirectional tree based change detection which again increases performance . As per ng-conf meetup, angular 2 is 5 times faster as compared to angular 1. 2). Angular 2 provides more choice for languages. Angular 2 provides more choice for languages. You can use any of the languages from ES5, ES6, TypeScript or Dart to write Angular 2 code. Where, Angular 1.x has ES5, ES6, and Dart. Using of TypeScript is a great step as TypeScript is awesome way to write JavaScript. 3). Angular 2 implements web standards like components. Angular 2 implements web standards like components, and it provides better performance than Angular 1. 4). AngularJS 2.0 is not easy to setup as AngularJS 1.x. AngularJS 1.x is easy to setup. All you need to do is to add reference of the library and you are good to go. Where AngularJS 2 is dependent of other libraries and it requires some efforts to set up it.[UPDATE: Angular Team heard this and they introduced [LINKED_TEXT: Angular CLI to create AngularJS 2 applications] [URL: http://www.talkingdotnet.com/angular-cli-for-angularjs-2/#content].] 5). Angular 1.x controllers and scope are gone. Angular 1.x controllers and scope are gone. We can say that controllers are replaced with “Components” in Angular 2. Angular 2 is component based. Angular 2 is using zone.js to detect changes. Angular 1.x Controllervar myApp = angular .module(\\"myModule\\", []) .controller(\\"productController\\", function(scope) { var prods = { name: \\"Prod1\\", quantity: 1 }; scope.products = prods; });Angular 2 Components using TypeScript import { Component } from '@angular/core'; @Component({ selector: 'prodsdata', template: '<h3>{{prods.name}}</h3>' }) export class ProductComponent { prods = {name: 'Prod1', quantity: 1 }; } Note: there is a class with ‘export’ keyword, @Componentannotation (that’s also new in Angular 2). The @Componentannotation adds the metadata to the class. 6). Different ways to define local variables. In Angular 2, local variables are defined using Hash(#) prefix. <div *ngFor=\\"#technicalDiary of technicalDiries\\"> 7). Structural directives syntax is changed. In Angular 2, Structural directives syntax is changed. ng-repeat is replaced with *ngFor.Angular 1.x structural directives: <ul> <li ng-repeat=\\"technology in technologies\\"> {{technology.name}} </li> </ul> Angular 2 structural directives: <ul> <li *ngFor=\\"#technology of technologies\\"> {{technology.name}} </li> </ul> Note: Asterisk(*) sign is used as prefix for structural directives, in is replaced with of and camelCase syntax is used. UPDATE: In AngularJS 2 version “2.0.0-beta.17”, there is a small change with respect to *ngFor. Instead of “#” use “let”. 8). Angular 2 uses camelCase syntax for built-in directives. Angular 2 uses camelCase syntax for built-in directives. For example, ng-class is now ngClass and ng-model is now ngModel. 9). Angular 2, directly uses the valid HTML DOM element properties and events. One of the major change in Angular 2 is, that it directly uses the valid HTML DOM element properties and events. Due to this, many of the available built-in directives in Angular 1.x are now no longer required. Like ng-href, ng-src, ng-show and ng-hide. Angular 2 uses href, src and hiddenproperties to get the same output. And same goes with event based directives like ng-click and ng-blur. <button ng-click=\\"doSomething()\\"> And in Angular 2, take the HTML event and wrap it with parentheses. <button (click)=\\"doSomething()\\"> 10). One-way data binding directive replaced with [property]. In Angular 1.x, ng-bind is used for one-way data binding, but with Angular 2 it is replaced with [property], where ‘property’ is valid HTML DOM element property.Angular 1.x, one-way data binding <input ng-bind=\\"technology.name\\"></input> Angular 2, one-way data binding is achieved via wrapping the properties with square brackets. <button (click)=\\"doSomething()\\"> 11). Two-way data binding: ng-model replaced with [(ngModel)] In Angular 1.x, ng-model is used for two-way data binding, but with Angular 2 it is replaced with [(ngModel)].Angular 1.x, two-way data binding, <input ng-model=\\"technology.name\\"></input> In Angular 2, <input [(ngModel)]=\\"technology.name\\"></input> 12). Way of Bootstrapping Angular Application is changed: Angular 1.x has 2 ways to bootstrap angular. One using ng-appattribute and other via code. <script> angular.element(document).ready(function() { angular.bootstrap(document, ['myApp']); }); <\/script> In Angular 2, say goodbye to ng-app. The only way to bootstrap angular is via code. import { bootstrap } from 'angular2/platform/browser'; import { ProductComponent } from './product.component'; bootstrap(ProductComponent); The bootstrap function is used and it takes starting component which is also parent component of your angular application. 13). Ways of Dependency Injection is Changed- syntax changed. One of the advantages of Angular is Dependency Injection. With Angular 2 DI is there but now there is a different way to inject dependencies. As everything is ‘class’ in Angular, so DI is achieving via constructors. In Angular 1.x, var myApp = angular .module(\\"myModule\\", []) .controller(\\"productController\\", function(scope, http) { var prods = { name: \\"Prod1\\", quantity: 1 }; scope.products = prods; }); In Angular 2, import { Injectable } from 'angular2/core'; @Injectable() export class TechnologyService { constructor(private _http: Http) { } getTechnologies() { return [new technology(1, 'Angular'), new technology(2, 'jQuery', new technology(3, 'Node'), new technology(4, 'Knockout') ]; } } Note: @Injectable() is added to service class. It is similar to Angular 1.x inject used for DI. 14). Way of routing is Changed- syntax changed. In Angular 1.x, we use routeProvider.when() to configuring routing. Where in Angular 2, @RouteConfig{(...}) is used. ng-view present in Angular 1.x is replaced with <router-outlet>In Angular 1.x, var app = angular .module(\\"MyModule\\", [\\"ngRoute\\"]) .config(function (routeProvider) { routeProvider .when(\\"/home\\", { templateUrl: \\"home.html\\", controller: \\"homeController\\" }) .when(\\"/technology\\", { templateUrl: \\"technology.html\\", controller: \\"technologyController\\" }) }) .controller(\\"homeController\\", function (scope) { scope.message = \\"Home Page\\"; }) .controller(\\"technologyController\\", function (scope) { scope.technologies = [\\"ASP.NET\\", \\"jQuery\\", \\"AngularJS\\", \\"JavaScript\\"]; }) In Angular 2, import { Component } from 'angular2/core'; import { RouteConfig, ROUTER_DIRECTIVES, ROUTER_PROVIDERS } from 'angular2/router'; import { TechnologyComponent } from './technology/technology.component'; import { TechnologyService } from './Technology/Technology.service'; @Component({ selector: 'my-app', templateUrl: 'app/app.component.html', directives: [ROUTER_DIRECTIVES], providers: [ ROUTER_PROVIDERS, TechnologyService ] }) @RouteConfig([ { path: '/home', name: 'Home', component: HomeComponent, useAsDefault: true }, { path: '/technology', name: 'Technology', component: TechnologyComponent }, ]) export class AppComponent { } Routing is a separate module that’s why need to import it. And 2 more configurations needs to be to make routing work, one is adding[ROUTER_DIRECTIVES] as directive and other is to add ROUTER_DIRECTIVES in providers list. And in HTML page, <ul> <li><a [routerLink]=\\"['Home']\\" href=\\"\\">Home</a></li> <li><a [routerLink]=\\"['Technology']\\" href=\\"\\">Technology</a></li> </ul> ng-href is also replaced by [routerLink].

It is some of the most disingenuous nonsense ever put forth. Textbooks, museums, and educational programs are for remembering and learning from history. Monuments are for expressing value judgments about that history - either celebrating or mourning. And the value judgments expressed by the monuments currently being removed, or under consideration for removal, are incompatible with today's societal consensus. They celebrate those who led the rebellion. They mourn the Lost Cause of the struggle for states' rights.. specifically the right to base their economy on slavery. The declarations of secession make it clear that no other rights were at issue. The timeline for the construction of many of these monuments makes that abundantly clear. many of them were constructed in the 1960s during the Civil Rights Movement, while those same southern states were adding various references to the old Confederate Battle flag to their state flags and seals. Their choice of heroes, people like Nathan Bedford Forrest who not only fought in the war but founded the Ku Klux Klan after, signifies clear intent to glorify the worst aspects of the Confederacy and intimidate those who sought to fight still-entrenched discrimination a century later."},{"prompt":"What is the future tense of teach?","completion":"Will teach"},{"prompt":"w many libertarians reign the Freedom Caucus, and who are they?","completion":"None of the members of the Freedom Caucus have signed the libertarian pledge or have bound themselves to the Libertarian Platform.

At conception the fertilized human egg is just two cells that have combined their DNA into one, an amoeba with human DNA. When it begins to divide and form more cells, it becomes a morula, a solid ball of cells, a community of single celled organisms. Each cell has its own life energy. It is alive, but it is not human. Then, the cells continue to divide and form a hollow ball, a blastocyst. For the first three weeks after conception, the cells grow to form the placenta. Again, each cell has its own life energy, but is basically a single celled organism playing a cooperative role. Is a placenta human? It gets thrown away after the birth. So for at least the first three weeks, there is nothing human in the womb, just a growing placenta. By week 6 or 7 of gestation, the brain and nervous system have developed enough for the spinal chord to begin forming neutrons and synapses which will allow the fetus to make its first movements. At 45 days, an EEG can detect developing brain waves. To my mind, that is when the fetus becomes a human being, when the energy of brain activity indicates that the fetus is experiencing its own existence.

I made a 1 a script. I was 15 and I would stay up at night dreaming about making 150 every two weeks. It's sad but that's what I spent my money on. My brother meanwhile made 4 bucks an hour cleaning the clubhouse of our mobile home park. At the end of the year I had a burrito belly and he bought a Super Nintendo. My next sales gig was getting petitions signed for political causes I didn't understand. What I do remember was getting 2 for some sort of Indian Reservation initiative that I don't understand to this day. That gig paid for a lot of carne asada burritos. My buddy Dave needed me to help him sell 10 year old used cars next to a tire store. I was 19 and my comp jumped exponentially with this gig. I wasn't making a buck or two pedaling newspaper scripts and petitions anymore. I will say that the lowing paying gigs helped me get over my fear of talking to strangers. Skill #1: Talking to strangers and the ability to sell. This skill can help you negotiate a higher salary at your current job. And help you position your value to the company. Skill #2: Position your self in a revenue generating position with your company. You may be thinking that this isn't a skill. Maybe it isn't I don't know. Too many people get jobs on the wrong side of the financial statement. Leverage your role to the revenue generating side of the business and ask that your comp be tied to the financial success of the company. There are a hundred a one other skills that can increase your comp. Those are the two that have worked for me."},{"prompt":"What is the best army strategy for TH10 in COC?","completion":"There are multiple effective strategies for TH10 but it all depends on what base you are attacking(like you wouldn’t use Pekkas for bases with single infernos). Here’s my list of effective attack strategies for trophy push, farming, and wars. Trophy Pushing: The strategy that I have found most effective for regular trophy pushing is(there’s 2). Golem(1 or 2), Valks(14–18), Wiz(4–10). Create funnel with Golem, Wizards, and Heroes. Once you have a secured funnel into the base(Valks may go around outside of base if not funneled correctly), deploy Valks(try not to place them after your heroes die). Let them attack for a bit, and then drop heal when they are at half health. The Valks are prone to splitting up in the base so I usually bring 3 heals, 2 rage, and freeze(infernos). Drop heals on the area with most Valks(its fine to use 1 heal on the other group of Valks) and rage them once they hit the town hall. This attack strategy is pretty effective for pushing from Crystal League(mostly TH9’s) to Masters. Once you hit Champions League, its harder to use this strategy. Another awesome strategy for trophy pushing past Champions League is sort of a mix of BoWitch and PekkaSmash. 4 Pekkas(atleast 4), 12–18 Bowlers, and 4 Healers. Drop Queen and Healers for walk along side you are funneling. Once you take out the first few defences, place all your Pekkas and the Bowlers behind them. Spells are 2 Heals, 2 Rage, 1 Leap, and 1 Freeze. Heal the Bowlers(they don’t have much health) and rage them once they reach center. Continue raging and healing them(leap can be used to speed up attack). I find this very effective and use this often. Farming: What you look for in a farming army is low cost. 10 Giants, and all Archers, Barbarians, or Goblins(I prefer these). No spells necessary! Deploy Giants so the defenses go after the Giants and then place whatever you have after the defenses are locked on. I chose 10 Giants because 1 usually dies quickly so placing 2 will give you more time to loot. War Attack: I’d say just experiment what you are comfortable with doing. Bases vary so not one strategy works for all bases. Perfecting your war strategy takes the most time and experience. To practice, settle down in a clan with good donations, so you can constantly practice your war attacks. Thank you for your time. This is my guide for TH10 attacking. Experiment with your armies!"},{"prompt":"w are leprechauns and fourleaf clovers related?","completion":"saint.paites day"},{"prompt":"w many countries have you travelled to and which are they?","completion":"As an[LINKED_TEXT: artificial intelligence ] [URL: https://tourwithdev.com/]language model, I don't have the physical ability to travel, so I haven't been to any countries.

So, when Scottish colonists settled the southern end of New Zealand’s South Island, they wanted to build a new “Edinburgh” in their new South Pacific homeland. But the name “Edinburgh” was already taken, so their new city was christened “Dunedin”: Source: [LINKED_TEXT: Wikipedia] [URL: http://wikipedia.org/] Above the statue of Robbie Burns at the centre of the Octagon, the central plaza of Dunedin. Unfortunately, it is the Anglican cathedral (St. Paul’s) in the background. The proper Presbyterian church is just to the southeast of the Octagon, and if the photo were taken looking the opposite direction you could see it: First Church of Otago (source: wikipedia.org) The small river which flows through Dunedin is named, naturally enough, “The Water of the Leith” after the river which flows through Edinburgh. They unfortunately omitted to name the long inlet of the sea, on which Dunedin lies, the Firth of Forth; but other than that all steps were taken to ensure that the new city would remind the settlers of Auld Reeky. (The weather also matches — because Dunedin lies at the south of the South Island, it is perpetually cold, grey, and damp.) (And lovers of England — do not despair. Half-way up the east coast of the South Island lies the fair city of Christchurch. Here men of England, Anglicans in fact, settled and founded the perfectly English city. It is not modelled on any specific English city, rather it represents the perfect English city — the English city of the imagination as opposed to all those in reality which all fall short in one way or another of the ideal. Regrettably, there doesn’t seem to have been a sufficiently large contingent of Welshmen to build “New Cardiff” somewhere… )"},{"prompt":"Why are Malaysia and Indonesia different countries?","completion":"What a lot of people don’t realize is that always for the last 1500 years China considered any united political entity in South East Asia as a threat to its maritime access to India and Africa. During some periods, they would retreat from this perspective and South East Asia and Indo-China would consolidate under empires (Mahajapit and Khmer for example) but then China would begin to stir again and these empires would splinter because China would interfere and splinter these united political entities. It didn’t matter whether the rulers were Han, Mongol or Manchus, eventually Beijing (or whatever was the capital city) came to the same geopolitical conclusion in every epoch. Islamization of South East Asia has to be seen in this context. Hindu Mahajapit empire was attacked by China that encouraged smaller Muslim states to take power. “During the reign of [LINKED_TEXT: Wikramawardhana] [URL: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikramawardhana]of [LINKED_TEXT: Majapahit] [URL: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majapahit], a series of [LINKED_TEXT: Ming] [URL: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_Dynasty] armada [LINKED_TEXT: naval expeditions] [URL: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_voyages] led by [LINKED_TEXT: Zheng He] [URL: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zheng_He],[LINKED_TEXT: [3]] [URL: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demak_Sultanate#cite_note-Coedes-3]:241–242 a [LINKED_TEXT: Muslim] [URL: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim] Chinese admiral, arrived in Java several times spanning the period from 1405 to 1433.

But South East Asian entities were too weak to resist and submitted to European control eventually. But the retrenchment of China and the growth of European colonial powers allowed them to divide up South East Asia into larger entities. Large Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia and smaller East Timor and Brunei. Today an ascendant China is back onto its historic quest to fragment its neighbor's. A united Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines are not in its national interest of China. So enjoy this period of peace and unity as it will not last long.

Could any of that energy be captured for human needs, using trees as a sort of natural windmill?","completion":"You could do it with a ratchet-device that, for example, turned a generator when the tree bent but not when it relaxed back, or vice versa, or that used a rectifier to make use of both the bending and unbending. But it would be a terribly inefficient approach in that it would generate power only when the wind speed or direction was changing; an efficient system would make use of the steady component of the wind — which is what windmills do. It’s like the difference between thermoelectric and pyroelectric devices: thermoelectric power is generated whenever there is a temperature difference between two reservoirs, whereas pyroelectric power is generated only when a temperature is changing.

You will have almost no mentoring, beyond very limited pure academic help. This follows the raw principle: “Swimm or sink.”Using an agency is exactly the contrary of what is expected from you.

Their students have more resources for support, and enjoy a home environment where academic success is the norm and has been for generations. By necessity, public school teachers must be very creative - they have to know how to differentiate instruction, scaffold lessons, and assume far more of the responsibility for a child’s education than a private school teacher.

However, she’s also been quite firm and protective of her son when it comes to it, so she’s not completely frail. In fact, she’s very supportive of her son. Most of her worries stem from him, such as worrying about his state of health and the dangers of being a hero, to the point where she almost didn’t let Izuku relocate to UA’s dorms. However, she respects her son’s wishes to become a hero, having been the one to give him his initial hero costume and apologised a lot for letting him think she didn’t believe in him. Mitsuki Bakugo Mitsuki’s quirk is simply ‘Glycerin,’ which allows her to produce a smooth liquid substance from her skin. It’s said to have done wonders to her skin, but has no real functionality in a fight other than making herself a bit more slippery. She can be extremely tough and aggressive, just like her son, and this attitude could help carry her through situations. Despite her aggro nature, she does care for her son, being concerned over his flaws that were shoved onto him because of his pampered childhood. She does believe Katsuki can become a great hero and thanks the teachers of UA for believing in him as well. Rei Todoroki Rei has an ice quirk, and it certainly has to be a strong one for Endeavor to have decided to marry her for it. She’s been seen using it once in the manga currently, and that was to immediately treat the burns she had inflicted on Shoto after snapping on him. Once said to be very caring and loving towards her children, she would always try to defend them from Endeavor’s constant abuse, even at her own expense. His torment got to her, though, and is recovering in a psychiatric ward, still quite fearful of him. In almost all of his free time, Shoto visits her often in the hospital, and the two appear to have reconciled and can get along again without tension. Mika Jiro Sharing the same quirk as her daughter, we can assume that they share the exact same functions, such as picking up faint sounds and using them alike to prehensile limbs. Not much else is known about her personality, but she seems to have a good enough relationship with her daughter as she and her husband encouraged Kyoka to pursue her hero dreams rather than go for a music career. Beru Asui Beru has frog-like features, akin to both her husband and her daughter. It can be assumed that she has some or all of the froggy abilities that Tsuyu has. We can also assume her relationship with her daughter is on good terms, as she seems to trust Tsuyu in taking care of the other kids by herself while she and her husband work. Water Hose A hero duo that perished after sacrificing themselves to save a village from the villain Muscular, both of Kota’s parents had water-based quirks, which were said to be powerful enough to severely damage the A-rank villain that ended them. Kota was heavily scarred by their deaths, considering how close he was to them as well as his age, and developed a cynical view of heroes until the Forest Training Camp. Nana Shimura (also, manga spoilers from here) Before her death, Nana had been boasting both an unknown original quirk as well as the power of One For All. This most likely made her extremely powerful, though still not enough to beat All For One. While she definitely loved her son with all her heart, how she decided to protect him from her job as a hero indirectly caused her grandson’s development into becoming Tomura Shigaraki, thanks to her son feeling betrayed by her. The Mother of Quirks Technically a mother. Specifically, the mother of Chikara Yotsubashi, aka Destro. While she didn’t have a quirk, she supported and defended her child, who did, in a time where quirks were called ‘meta abilities’ and were feared. Quirks users were hated, but she spoke out in defence of them after seeing how her own son was being discriminated against because of them. Initially, she was ignored and later killed by an Anti-Quirk group, but as order was being brought back, the government adopted her words and quirks were made legal. They called her the Mother of Quirks due the things she said. I’m probably missing a few more, but those are who I can remember at the top of my head. So who’s the most powerful? When it comes to who had the most influence on the world? You could argue Nana Shimura here, since she fought AFO and unintentionally caused the chain of events that would lead to AFO raising her grandson to be a dangerous villain. However, I think that the Mother of Quirks takes the cake. If she hadn’t spoken out, quirk society today might have ended up a lot differently (though this opinion might change later, when I have more of a think about it). But in terms of raw strength (which I assume is what the asker of this question is looking for)? Definitely Shimura. Having OFA naturally makes her the strongest mother here."},{"prompt":"w can I earn 1,000 monthly as a freelancer?","completion":"How can I earn 1000 per month as a freelancer?

Trump wants to bring back manufacturing jobs, but are they ready for the big paycut that would require?","completion":"Cheap labor isn't the only reason, but that is a big part of it. Depending on the product being discussed, labor is just a fraction of the problem. The other heavy burden is the over regulations by local and Federal laws in the US. To bring jobs back doesn't always mean a pay cut. The cost of that product could be reduced by reducing costly regulations which may have little to nothing to do with labor. Lastly, let's pretend the jobs come back and manufacturing costs stay sky high, Americans can learn to adjust to the idea of paying more for quality.

So usually you set a maximum number allowed and prevent the system from going past that. If you're say doing a Monte Carlo approach you do this by rejecting any move that will take the system past the maximum allowed. In most situations you'll find the system will saturate out with particles anyways. So long as the max is larger than what you need to properly simulate the system you should get accurate results.

If you remember, Madara’s brother, Izuna, was stated to be his equal: In fact, Itachi stated that they were equal in every possible way. Itachi was the top scorer on the Academy Exam, tied with Minato, so he’s easily book-smart enough for his statement to be credible. In their battle, Tobirama one-shot blitzed Izuna, MS Madara’s equal. (The filler Fireball-Water clash was never in the canon, where it was a blitz one shot.) Therefore, the conclusion is undeniable— Tobirama would smack Madara before he attains EMS. Tobirama vs EMS Madara Without doubt, EMS Madara is substantially stronger than his past-self. Can he win? Probably, but not necessarily. Why is this the case? Tobirama’s speed is insane. For instance, when Juubito blitzed him, Tobirama was able to tag him and counterblitz later on which is a huge reaction speed feat. In conjunction, despite that Tobirama’s blitz attempt against Madara was indisputably a failure, Tobirama still teleported before Madara was able to tag him. Of course, I’m not saying Tobirama’s speed is as fast as any of those characters, just that he has shown the feats to react to them to make EMS Madara being able to tag him very improbable, since EMS Madara is slower than either Juubito or SM Madara. In conjunction, Madara stated he was fully aware of Tobirama’s fighting style, which probably contributed greatly as well as his precognition in terms of intercepting the blitz attempt. (Keep in mind: Edo Tobirama is slower than alive Tobirama as edos have lower stats than alive.) I want to also add one very pertinent aspect, since Madara stated Tobirama was the fastest of his time, it proves Tobirama was faster than Hashirama who is relative to Madara in speed. In fact, Madara’s statement probably includes past Madara himself (EMS). Therefore, Tobirama is still faster than EMS Madara. In crisp contrast, EMS Madara’s attacks and durability are far stronger than Tobirama. Tobirama is too fast for Madara’s attacks, but Madara’s attacks are too strong for Tobirama’s durability. While I still think the result of this battle leans towards Madara, I wanted to debunk the ridiculous notion that it’s a “stomp”. Tobirama vs later versions of Madara: The same analysis above applies for Edo Madara, but is slightly more skewed towards Tobirama, because Alive Madara is stronger than Edo Madara: Despite this scaling, Edo Madara is more problematic for Tobirama because of repertoire and arsenal. The Rinnegan’s Deva Path can greatly restrict Tobirama’s freedom of movement with FTG, and could quite possibly nullify his chances. Regardless of this, Edo Madara is still, in a sense, within the same league as Tobirama although Madara is far stronger. Later versions of Madara without doubt far, far stronger than anything Tobirama can handle. Conclusion Tobirama blitzes MS Madara,loses with mid/high difficulty to EMS & Edo Madaraand gets curbstomped by any higher versions of Madara (SM, Juubi, 3E)"},{"prompt":"Do soldiers pick up fallen enemy weapons to use if they are out of ammo on their weapons?","completion":"Although this is not recommended, but this was a common practice by early Chinese Communist forces during Chinese civil war, Sino-Japanese War, and Korean War. Poorly equipped, heavy combat casualties, limited fund (especially when COMINTERN lost control to Communist Party of China after the Long March 1934–35), they were totally on their own during this period. To maintain a long term guerilla warfare and logistics, THIS IS THE LAST RESORT and quite helpful. It had been frequently mentioned in CPC official history and propaganda. “没有枪，没有炮，敌人给我们造!” (Transliteration: “If we have no rifles, no guns, our enemy will manufacture for us!” Lyrics from “The Song of Partisan”, which is so popular in China since Sino-Japanese War) Mao Zedong did setup so called “10 principles” for the communist forces during a meeting in winter 1947. The 9th principles is “reinforce your forces with captured personnel and weapons. Our supplies are mostly came from the frontline”.

My understanding of the Operation Neptune Spear carried out by the Navy Seals in Abbotabad is that it required years of foreign intelligence and planning and also luck to execute. The difference then and now is that Masood Azhar, the leader of JeM and the mastermind behind this attack is roaming as a free citizen in Pakistan unlike Bin Laden who was declared a Terrorist globally and had no intention of being a drone target out in the open. As of today, Masood Azhar unlike Bin laden who hid in compound with 12/18 feet walls, is being treated at Army base Hospital in Pakistan. So, you can't just fly above pakistan and conduct a surgical strike amidst an Army Hospital. We can't take a country like Pakistan for granted. They have a working Military and Airforce just like ours, less equipped but same morale, attitude and capability to take any unprepared intruders down with the help of their military or air defence. So as easy as it sounds as a soultion being recommended by our fellow countrymen. Its not. If China had helped us declare Masood Azhar as a global terrorist at UNSC, maybe we could have taken an aggressive action at a moments notice. So, your question, we do have weapons, may not be as a sophisticated as theirs but enough to conduct a raid.

I don’t even have a bike, actually. During this time, I’ve racked up 890.97 in Uber fares, for about 110 a month. This includes fares that I paid which were split with other people (including a 150 round trip that was split four ways), but doesn’t include fares others paid for me, so it’s probably a wash. Uber is really critical to this working; without it, or a similar service like Lyft, this wouldn’t be nearly as possible. There are a lot of old answers to this question from 2010 to 2012 or so that state it’s impossible, but times have changed in the last few years. Here’s some basic info on how this works, logistically: I live walking distance to work, to downtown Mountain View, and to the Caltrain. This was a main consideration for me when looking for housing, since this unlocks the most common things I want to do: getting to/from work, going to SF, getting groceries, and going out to restaurants from home.This part isn’t critical if you’re okay with biking to these places. Almost everyone else I know living in the South Bay without a car uses a bike to get to work, and it generally seems to work out okay for them.I do a lot of online shopping. This includes clothes and various household and kitchen items, from juicers to toilet paper to glassware to bedsheets. To stock my home bar, I’ve even purchased about 40 bottles of booze online. Even if I had a car, I’d probably still do most or all of this online, since internet shopping is more convenient.The only time so far I’ve really wanted to shop in-person rather than online was for furniture.I’m comfortable and willing to use Uber a lot. There are plenty of times when I want to go somewhere beyond a comfortable walking distance, like visiting a friend on the other end of town or going to Palo Alto, etc. I never hesitate to just call an Uber for this. I put the emphasis on the psychology here because it can feel super weird to spend 20 on an Uber round trip just to go get dinner or something, and if you don’t get over the initial weirdness, you’ll find yourself being unwilling to go places you’d be able to go if you had a car, and your quality of life suffers.As I mentioned at the beginning, I’m spending ~110 a month on Uber, which isn’t actually that much compared to the cost of owning a car.I use public transit judiciously. This means the Caltrain to/from SF and San Jose. This takes longer than driving in general, but often not significantly longer (traffic on 101 is routinely awful), particularly if you make a point of taking the faster bullet trains. I generally use this time to read or listen to podcasts or similar and so I don’t really mind it.I’ve also taken the VTA a couple times with good results. There are definitely downsides to not owning a car. There are distances in the neighborhood of 1 mile or 1.5 miles that still take a while to walk but feel too short to use Uber for, though if you use a bike these aren’t a problem. On the other end of the spectrum, there are distances in the 1+ hour drive range that are just too long to Uber and require some alternative arrangement. There are also times when you might want a trunk. I mentioned furniture shopping above as one example, but you can think of others. There’s some loss of freedom: without a car, I don’t have the ability to just whimsically drive around and explore the area. And relying on online shopping loses some immediacy. And of course, all this only really works because I’m young and have no kids. I don’t think this lifestyle would be particularly palatable if I were older and/or had a family. Overall, though, I think it’s eminently possible to live even in the South Bay without a car. I intend on getting one eventually, but I don’t feel any pressure to do so, and I haven’t felt that my life has been significantly worsened by not having one."},{"prompt":"Do childhood vaccinations cause autism?

With 15 years of experience, CMAs get Rs.49 Lakhs per annum as salary in 2023. If you dont get that, you are in the wrong organization and you are in working in a small LALA shop under a proprietor. You need to move out at the earliest. With 20 years of experience, CMA get Rs.60 lakhs as fixed pay per annum and after including variable pay and retirals, the total CTC will be Rs.70 lakhs per annum. Again, if you dont get this, you are an exception and you need to move out of your LALA shop/ Nadar Kadai. With 25 years of experience, you will on the board of 10 + companies, hence your sitting fees will be close to Rs.20 lakhs per annum, Salaries and bonus etc will be more than Rs.2 crores. You need to maintain that till you retire with around 35 years of experience. There is no limit to what you can earn with this level of experience. If you are in board of international companies, you will be paid in and Euros, hence that may be added too.

I think they push proposals not to reduce crime or violence, but to harass gun owners. One example is they are much more passionate about putting obstacles in the path of law-abiding gun owners than punishing criminal use of firearms; and prosecuting people for violations of technical rules rather than people who hurt innocent people. They go after the most popular rifle, the AR-15 styles, not the guns used in crimes and suicides (handguns) or the most lethal guns (shotguns and hunting rifles). I think some of these people are simply afraid of guns. They aren’t familiar with them and can’t imagine touching one. They learn from wild inaccuracies on television and movies. They accept the dangers from more familiar things, like cars, power tools and household chemicals, because they understand those things and know how to protect themselves and their kids. Also they understand why people want those things, while people who want guns seem unfamiliar and scary. Another group isn’t afraid of guns, but they consider them essential parts of a toxic culture of violence—steeped in racism, sexism, hostility and ignorance. They hope reducing civilian gun ownership to Canadian levels would reduce crime and violence to Canadian levels. They don’t expect to confiscate all guns tomorrow, but a couple of generations of harassment could change the gun culture to the point that confiscation is politically possible—the way public attitudes toward smoking changed."},{"prompt":"w do you wake yourself up in the morning?","completion":"Thanks David/Jerry/Victor for a2a.

I’ve been told, and I’ve read, that no matter how many times you write it doesn’t do it like you could write over a written text with the same pen. Instead, no matter what, you’ll overwrite only some of the data. However, if you fill the drive once with whatever data (I were told just throwing in zeroes is as good as using a random-writing algo for anyone who doesn’t have special hardware) it’ll be pointless trying to get the data out since you’ll only have pieces you can’t piece together into intelligeble text. Or instead … The recommended method I’ve been reading is to write the drive full whatever random shit you can get, the less intelligeble the better.encrypt the whole drive with AES-256 1000-char (I chose 1000 arbitrarily) random auto-generated pw. You can use a longer pw if you want, but 1000 combined with AES-256 is more than enough. In fact it’s extreme overkill since AES-256 hasn’t even remotely been broken; AES-128 was broken up to like 48 bits (can’t remember the exact number). #1 was so that there’s little in common among the content. If you filled with zeroes the content is too similar despite not being completely zeroed out, and encrypting those zeroes wouldn’t really help. Now the data is so random and so strongly encrypted it’s absolutely impossible to break with anything that can be built today. I reckon it’ll take closer to 100–500y before computers become fast enough to make it feasable, and even if that encryption was broken the data would make so little sense it’s absolute waste of time. But when it comes to Flash, the drives are nowadays transparently encrypted with randomly auto-generated pw using AES-256 more often than not. But if it’s not, you should use something like 30-char AES-256 full-disk encryption if you don’t wanna kill the drive. But if you wanna kill the drive, you’ll run full-disk encryption with AES-256 using as long pw as you can enter until it dies. Trying to recover a Flash-based drive that’s died (other way than a controller chip) is impossible. Other way is to use the drive’s integrated erasure feature. It works by releasing the electricity, that makes up the data, stored in the cells. It takes a fairly long time, like 1h for 100GB, but the data is totally destroyed. Memory cards and sticks don’t have this, though, only the drives for installing into a computer."},{"prompt":"What are the qualities of a successful leader?","completion":"VisionPassionCommunicationEmpathyFocus Image by Sasin Tipchai from Pixabay"},{"prompt":"What is the procedure of all possible regression model selection techniques using Rsquare and MSE criteria?

What should I do?","completion":"This is a difficult situation, especially since your partner and your therapy dog have both been important parts of your life for different lengths of time. There is no single, easy answer to this situation, as there are many factors to consider. The first thing to do is to assess why your partner doesn’t like your therapy dog. If your partner’s dislike is based on a legitimate concern, such as allergies or a fear of dogs, then it is important to consider their feelings and how to address them. It is important to try to find a compromise that both of you can be comfortable with. For example, you might consider asking your partner to stay in a different room when you are with your therapy dog, or taking extra precautions to keep the dog away from your partner. On the other hand, if your partner’s dislike of your therapy dog is simply because they don’t like animals, then it is important to talk to them about why they don’t like animals and to understand their perspective. In this case, it is important to remember that your relationship is still in its early stages and that you should try to be understanding of your partner’s feelings. No matter the reason for your partner’s dislike of your therapy dog, it is important to have an honest conversation about the issue. Talk to them about why they don’t like your therapy dog and how you feel about it. This conversation should focus on understanding each other’s perspectives and finding a way to move forward that is comfortable for both of you. It is also important to remember that your therapy dog has been a part of your life for 10 years and that you have a special bond with the dog. The dog has been a source of comfort, companionship, and support for you, and it is important to remember these benefits when discussing the issue with your partner. Finally, it is important to consider the future of your relationship. If your partner’s dislike of your therapy dog is something that you are unable to resolve, then it is important to consider if this is something that you can continue to accept in the long-term. If not, then it might be best to seek a different relationship in which both you and your partner feel comfortable and respected. In summary, it is important to assess why your partner doesn’t like your therapy dog, to have an honest conversation about the issue, and to remember the benefits that your therapy dog has brought to your life. It is also important to consider the future of your relationship and to seek a different relationship if needed. Please support my work by upvoting this article.

Besides the unprecedented popularity of these frameworks, another topic of discussion is how they are different from each other. If you’re a beginner, there is a high chance you might be confused between Angular and AngularJS. Right? But remember, these frameworks are quite dissimilar. Here we have discussed this topic in-depth to give you more clarity about these frameworks in a much better way. Not only this, but we have also covered how these frameworks can help you in your next project. So, let’s delve into this topic without further ado. Before we discuss the difference between Angular and AngularJS, let’s learn more about what they are. What is Angular? Angular is an open-source front-end framework developed by the tech-giant Google and was first released for public use in September 2016. This framework uses the TypeScript programming language that eliminates unnecessary codes and helps in building lighter and faster app solutions. On top of that, it is also modular in nature. It means you can divide the whole application into small modules having different functionality. Angular offers two-way data binding that gives a reason to a user to say yes to [LINKED_TEXT: Angular development services] [URL: https://www.75way.com/web-development-service.php][LINKED_TEXT: .] [URL: https://www.75way.com/web-development-service.php] Angular’s base version is Version 2, whereas the current edition is Version 12 or Angular 12. If you want to develop a modern and powerful web app having a user-friendly design, Angular is the ideal framework to choose for your project. What is AngularJS? Also developed by Google and introduced in 2010, AngularJS is an open-source Javascript based framework that is also suitable for front-end development. AngularJS facilitates single-page applications development, and this is what differentiates it from Angular. Do you know an interesting thing about AngularJS? It is the first version of Angular. Let’s make it simple for you. All the 1.XX versions are Angular 1 and belong to AngularJS, whereas version 2 are known as Angular. AngularJS is created using JavaScript. There’s no use of TypeScript, making it a different framework from Angular. AngularJS is nowadays highly used in creating modern and dynamic web applications and websites. Just like Angular, AngularJS also sticks with MVC architecture that enables an [LINKED_TEXT: AngularJS developer] [URL: https://www.75way.com/] to build something impressive, fast and user-friendly. How Angular is Different from AngularJS? Programmers and web developers across the globe highly use Angular, and AngularJS. But it is vital to be cognizant of how they are different from each other. Well, we have discussed this topic in-depth below. Below, we have covered the key points highlighting how Angular and AngularJS are different. 1. Architecture AngularJS supports the Model View Controller architecture or MVC. In such a case, you only have the business logic in the Model and desired output in the Controller, and Angular will accomplish the rest of the processing to deliver the desired output. Such model pipelines are automatically generated by AngularJS. On the other hand, Angular is built with components and directives that give a dynamic and modern structure to your applications. Such a modern architecture enables [LINKED_TEXT: Angular developers] [URL: https://www.75way.com/about.php] to build larger applications. 2. Supported Languages Another factor that differentiates Angular and AngularJS is supported languages. Yes. Talking about Angular, it provides support for both TypeScripts and JavaScript. On the other hand, AngularJS supports only JavaScript. 3. Difficulty Level Learning Angular is not easy as it involves a number of rules that are crucial to follow for front-end development. In simple words, you can build a great application if you have strong expertise in the Angular framework. Yes, it requires strong skills and expertise in the field. On the other hand, learning AngularJS is not as tricky as Angular. 4. Expression Syntax The expression syntax of Angular, especially when dealing with data binding, is easier than AngularJS. But how? Well, in the case of AngularJS, a developer has to remember using the correct ng directive for binding a property or an event. Whereas, in the case of Angular, you only have to use [] for property binding and () for event binding. 5. Dependency Injection (DI) Although both Angular and AngularJS use DI or Dependency Injection, the way they do it is entirely different. Angular uses a hierarchical dependency injection system with the help of declarations, providers and construction functions. Such Angular DI enhances the application performance. On the other hand, AngularJS DI is injected into the directives, link functions and controller functions definitions. 6. CLI (Command-line Interface) Angular comes with the CLI (Command-Line Interface) tool that further helps a developer generate and manage components, services, etc. and even entire projects from the command line very efficiently. Angular’s CLI tool allows you to create different versions of the same project for distinct platforms. AngularJS doesn’t have a CLI tool. 7. SEO Support SEO has emerged as the core strategy to reach a wider audience. The good news is that Angular supports SEO. It offers the required elements that make a web application crawlable for different search engines. AngularJS doesn’t have any element that can make your application SEO-friendly. 8. Mobile Support The last on our list is mobile support. AngularJS does not offer mobile development support, which gives a reason for many users to rethink choosing this framework. After all, today, the majority of the global population own smartphones. Angular offers complete mobile support. Conclusion Angular and AngularJS are the most used frameworks nowadays. Developers highly appreciate the features and ease these frameworks provide. But at the same time, it is crucial to understand how they are different to enjoy most of these frameworks. This blog has rounded up everything that can highlight their key differences.

Rapid Economic development at the end of the 19th century produced many prominent industrialists and the U.S. economy became the world's largest. \\" they were far better than present politicians of India in their disposition.\\" as you claimed, today's scenario is quite different and we can't compare yesteryears politicians with today's India has to counter a few problems which are non-existent in the USA. India belongs to a different category not just because it is a growing economy but because it is large and populous.Governing a country with the second largest population is not an easy task! We face challenges like: Communalism/ Casteism / Sectarianism Or Lack of unity: Quite often it is alleged that Indian society is ‘highly stratified’,‘disintegrated’ and a ‘discriminatory’ society.The divide and rule policy of the British Raj has left this country in shambles. India is home to a number of religions. The above problems exist even today, thanks to the Narrowmindedness and ego of certain influential individuals. It is an extremely challenging task to maintain Unity due to the constant threat from radical elements and extremists. Poverty, illiteracy and unemployment create a lot of compulsions, especially for the younger generation. Many remain unemployed and in a state of poverty, get involved in this. It is also a well known fact that communal violence is fuelled by foreign powers to malign the progress of this country. Economic/ Political Instability: For any country to be economically stable, the politicians need to be headstrong. They are reluctant to be responsible and take initiative to drive this country forward. While those leaders who take a stand simply don't find enough support or cooperation from their counterparts. Dr B.R. Ambedkar, the man behind the drafting of the constitution saw the reservation system as a temporary measure; he imagined that as time progresses Indians would be able to rise beyond their barriers of caste through education and knowledge. His vision became reality for the most part but what Dr Ambedkar didn’t foresee was the political selfishness and greed of the forthcoming generations of politicians. The Quota system that was supposed to be eliminated after few decades of independence was allowed to be extended over and over again, the most damaging part was the increment of these quotas from 7.5%-15% during the time of independence to almost 50% currently, in order to lure the voters in the caste based politics. There is still a serious lack of political consensus on issues like foreign investment, lowering interest rates on deposits in pension funds and privatising profit-making state-run factories.Agricultural input and output subsidies have proved to be unproductive, financially unsustainable, environmentally unfriendly in recent years, and contributed to increased inequality among rural Indian states. Selfishness/Mediocrity:Sometimes we are taught to refrain from raising our voices against attrocities because of the hostilities which linger around us. A large number of scams, wrong doings go unnoticed because MONEY is valued more than a human.We debate a lot about issues but lack on taking a stand. Mass protests are more politically motivated. The youth are constantly pressurized in terms of being the sole breadwinner of the family. They face excess competition and a lot of responsibilities fall on their shoulders Many are forced to live a life of mediocrity by sacrificing their ambitions. Skilled and talented workforce often leave the country for their own benefits since they are left demotivated by the lack of opportunities, poor infrastructure and outdated education system. Indian talent is more recognised overseas and where there is a chance to prove and succeed, talent moved there. Students are happy about getting a high salary Job but lack the ambition to excel in a particular field. Poor record in Research and Innovation: Our education system promotes a Rat race. A child is not exposed to the challenges faced in real life. Our teachers are not well trained and schools are poorly managed. We also face improper utilization of funds or inadequate funds. India lags behind in highly cited researchers and research papers published in journals with high impact factor.The current level of our spending on research and development is only 0.9 % of our GDP. Bureaucratic hassles in government and university departments act as major impediments in carrying out independent research. The environment in many university departments is not conducive for scholarly work. Plagiarism, facilitated by the cut and paste technology results in below average research outputs. Now for your claims, \\"They braced themselves to abolish peculiar institution of slavery. In sum, they were far better than present politicians of India in their disposition.\\" Today's scenario is quite different. It is unethical to compare yesteryear's politicians with today's Indian politicians because the challenges we face today are humongous! \\"I don't believe in Modi and his marketing. Even if we assume Modi has good intentions to bring the change, his party members are so corrupted and have robust criminal background.\\" Modi has just begun his term, it's too early to come to conclusions about his style of governance. Whether he succeeds or not, only time will tell. There are several key reasons why the American economy has dominated the world: 1) The abundance of natural resources in America2) The relatively low population density of America3) The development of a strong domestic market in America4) The possession of the majority of the world’s gold (by the 1930s America possessed 75% to 80% of all the mined gold in the world due to gold deposits in America)5) American investment in foreign countries is very high. 6) The adoption of the US dollar as the international reserve currency."},{"prompt":"Are there waves of air on top of our atmosphere like waves of water on the surface of the ocean?","completion":"I can think of one example.

Ambedkar hate Hinduism?","completion":"Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, called Mahatma = The Great Soul, was an Indian ATTORNEY, publicist, MORAL teacher, ascetic, and PACIFIST who became the SPIRITUAL and political LEADER of the Indian independence movement. Every law student, in whom there is a speck of sincerity, understands during his studies who the attorneys are. Most of them are money-grubbing sold souls and scum of the earth's inhabitants. The PACIFIST Gandhi (= perfume seller) who became a Vaishya \\"thanks\\" to his career. According to the clear Vedic Teaching Shudras and Vaishyas (who are only financially better off than Shudras) are Selves who have no knowledge or only a little knowledge about God. That was Mohandas. He was against the use of military force against the British plunderers because he was a coward; he was scared shitless of the British military power. Later, as the official leader of India, when he had to deal with the militarily weaker ones, he broke his promises given to them and used the entire military arsenal to fight his enemies - by HYPOCRITICALLY proclaiming - as attorneys do - \\"I will pray\\" - instead of keeping his promises and stopping the use of military force - and is thus responsible for a great many lives. All his life he has carried a copy of the Bhagavad Gita with him, but has never understood the slightest thing that is really written in it. About Upanishads, he has no idea, like all other Hindus. These are your \\"great ones\\" and \\"venerated ones\\" .... the Great Souls?! The PACIFISTS?! He prayed but did not take action, although he could do it with one word. Hypocrisy pure :( - What should you know about Hinduism, and the Vedas? Hinduism is a conglomeration of numerous different and contradictory teachings, schools, philosophies, sects, and religions - one falser than the other. To give just one example: If you go to one community, they will teach you \\"Advaita\\", as they understand it. In another community, they will teach you \\"Dvaita\\", as they understand it. And both are entirely wrong. To mention only one (of a \\"billion\\") example from Hinduism, from Hindu \\"spirituality\\", religion, recognition/ knowledge/ wisdom, and truth: Adi Shankara - one of the \\"greatest\\" Hindu teachers/ gurus/ philosophers ... knowers and wise-men ... and his recognition, his understanding, of the Advaita teaching (non-duality), which he represented and spread most zealously - what his countless followers (great Hindu gurus) do until today. From him and the like comes the statement, their recognition, their truth, which they spread until today: \\"Even if a tiger would eat me, I would tell him: I am you and you are me, we are one\\". Such fleshly (= completely spiritless beings = animals - I will write more about their animalism later) must then also say to a most brutal rapist and murderer, who rapes their ten-year-old daughter for five hours in the most brutal way, then cuts her up with a knife and eats her flesh, \\"I am you and you are me, we are one\\". In all such cases, they all participate in the evil deeds of the evildoers. How then? In the religion it is above all about the spiritual = feelings, thoughts, and ideas (= consciousness). Who doesn't distance himself decidedly from the evil deeds of the evildoers, he participates in their evil deeds = loads guilt/ sin on himself. That is what they have achieved after millennia, after rejecting the true Vedic Teaching which is known to very few Humans. Maharshi, Sadhguru & Co. For them is Adi Shankara (Quotation) \\"an intellectual giant, a genius of linguistics, and above all, a spiritual light and the pride of India. The level of wisdom and knowledge he showed at a very early age made him a shining light for humanity\\". \\"Swami\\" Prabhupada, the founder of ISKCON, has publicly stated his \\"heavenly recognition\\" that every woman enjoys it while being raped. And you call such vile beasts \\"swami\\"?! You must be similar to them. R. Maharshi has also made known \\"1000\\" of his heavenly recognitions. Here is just one of them as an example: \\"The greatest obstacle to enlightenment is getting past the delusion that you are not already enlightened.\\" And the masses (worldwide) rejoice: \\"I am already enlightened, I just didn't know that, we are all enlightened\\". Thus, the masses of the sleeping (of one who is also sleeping) become enthusiastic and become his followers. That is the \\"highest Hindu spirituality\\" that leads to moksha/ salvation/ eternal life. Disgusting is that. Osho has even called himself Bhagavan, and Sannyasi(n) too?! He has also declared all his disciples/ followers to be sannyasins and all of them were hyper-happy. So he has had a lot of fun with them, and has become very rich (exploiting them). But no idiot has looked (at least in Wikipedia) who and how a sannyasi(n) is. That is the highest Self, which has turned its back on this world, has left society and its own family, and lives without any possessions. This has been explained in detail in the Vedas/ Upanishads. The same. applies to Ramakrishna, Vivekananda, and Co. I cannot/ do not want to write here about \\"1000\\" of them. They all have in common that they make partial use of the Vedic Scriptures =Teaching of God. The essence of the Vedic Teachings is contained only in the chosen Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita. But, much-much more than these, the Hindus follow the man-made and therefore misleading Shudra scriptures. According to Vedic Teaching, Shudras (and Vaishyas, who have just a little more money) are people who have no knowledge or who have very little knowledge about God, although they can be (according to earthly ways of thinking and understanding) the highest scholars, philosophers, scientists, Nobel prize winners, Kings, etc. All Hindus ignore/ reject the essential Words from the Vedic Teaching, which could lead to Recognition and Knowledge, and follow the false teachings and \\"philosophies\\" of their fleshly (= not spiritual) gurus, who are all ignorant Shudras or Vaishyas. Everyone is born as a Shudra. So are all babies, but not all have the same potential they bring from previous lives. Some -Selves develop spiritually in their lives and go through various stages of spiritual development (Ashramas/ Varnas). One belongs to the caste (Varna) according to the degree of one's own spiritual development. That is the only proper criterion. The Spiritual is for a majority of Hindus incomprehensible, and they evaluate people by birth/ blood relationship. Therefore, they consider true Shudras (or Vaishyas) Brahmins; Shudras and Vaishyas who have not even started with the third stage of life and development (Vanaprastha Ashrama). Not to mention the Sannyasa (the fourth stage of development). Their ignorance is boundless. Some (not many) Selves in India and worldwide follow the Vedic Teaching. They are the true Kshatriyas and Brahmins, but not Hindus. Vedic Kshatriyas do not wage bloodshed wars. According to the Vedic Teaching, a Self becomes a Kshatriya, a warrior who begins to wage war against his own lusts, desires, earthly needs, and attachments/ to wage war to overcome them. Then begins the third stage of life (Vanaprastha Ashrama), when the man leaves his earthly family and society, retreats into solitude, intensively studies the Scriptures, and lives (thinks, talks, and acts) according to the Highest commandments of God. That is the only way. They no longer belong to any earthly community, association, organization, party, or nation. (They have left even their earthly family.) Then they begin to belong to their true, heavenly family, to the heavenly \\"nation\\", to the \\"folk\\" of God (that is also their origin), which consists of the selves/ souls/ individuals that can be incarnated in all earthly nations. They live (mainly) alone, but they are never lonely. Only then does one begin to understand the Scriptures in a proper, heavenly way, i.e., receiving Recognition/ Knowledge from God. The earthly way of thinking and understanding, earthly rationality and logic (such as of the Hindu gurus or the \\"middle path\\" of Gautama) are for the Shudras and Vaishyas = for fleshly, unspiritual, and ignorant earth-bound people. It is of no use at all to study the Scriptures intensively for decades (like the schoolbooks), but one must live according to them, i.e. think, talk and act according to the highest commandments of God. Only in this way can one begin to understand what is really written in the Scriptures. About the same thing/ question in all Scriptures quite different and contradictory things are said. Which of it is the Truth nobody can determine with the earthly way of thinking (ratio and logic). Only to those who live (think, talk and act) according to the highest commandments of God, God therefore bestows the so-called \\"discernment norm\\", i.e. the ability to distinguish the Right/ Truth from the wrong/ untruth. That is the recognition, the knowledge that can be received only and exclusively from God (as a reward for keeping His higher commandments) and is not transferable to other people. Even if one were to tell others about it, they would not be able to understand/ adopt anything of that, i.e., they could not possibly believe in it. That is something that only the Almighty God can bestow to one. For the Hindus, the spiritual is incomprehensible and they judge people by birth/ blood relationship. Therefore, they consider Brahmins to be people who are Shudras or at most Vaishyas; selves who have not even begun the third stage of life and development (Vanaprastha Ashrama). Not to mention the Sannyasa (the fourth stage of life and development). Their ignorance is boundless. There are some (not many) Selves in India and in the world, who follow the Vedic Teaching. They are the true Kshatriyas who later become Brahmins, but they are not Hindus. The Vedic Kshatriyas do not wage bloodshed wars. Hindus ignore the essentials Vedic Words of God, which refer to Him as the SECONDLESS, One, the Only One, the Creator, Ruler and the Lord of the Worlds ... and follow the Shudra scriptures of men such as Smritis ... Puranas, Gitas, Shastras, Agamas ... and worship \\"1000\\" alleged deities instead of worshipping the SECONDLESS/ SUPREME/ ABSOLUTE/ One GOD. Instead of striving (as required in the true Vedic Teaching) to become similar to Brahman (= Consciousness/ Spirit) and thus come closer to Him, they try to make Him (the Heavenly Spirit/ Consciousness) similar to themselves and depict Him in their iconography and mythology (developed by their shudra gurus) as a misbegotten, with deviant bodies and even as a monkey who has a tail. A tail = one cannot animalize Glorious/ Highest/ Supreme/ Absolute Existent more drastically. That is outrageous ignorance, godlessness, and primitivism, a stone-age belief. It would be appalling if the most severely mentally ill children did that. That it comes from the \\"highly esteemed\\" Hindu \\"gurus\\", about that .... God hears and sees everything. And yet, many even more ignorant, more stupid people (worldwide) think that Hinduism has something in common with spirituality and belief in a true God?! Dumber does not go. The inhabitants of the earth are in a terrible, idiotic state. As the teachers are, so are their students. And many Hindus also honor/ venerate Siddhartha Gautama, alias Buddha, who also left/ rejected the Vedic Teaching because he did not understand anything; more precisely, God did not let him understand anything. Then he misused a considerable part of the Vedas and developed his own, private \\"philosophy\\", according to which there is NO God and NO soul. But Hindus still honor him. In Hindu Shudra scriptures, it is said that he (Gautama) taught the Hindu gods. A Shudra, for whom there was no god, is said to have taught the gods. And many Hindus (incl. gurus) believe in it and consider him (Gautama - Shudra) as an enlightened one, as Mahatma = great soul (a soulless one?!), and even as an incarnation of God on earth - according to their Hindu Shudra scriptures. One nonsense after another, each bigger than the previous one. The situation in all other faith communities is not (much) different. All people are only exploited and kept in ignorance and darkness by their fleshly (non-spiritual) religions-leaders (gurus, clerics, imams, etc.). The leaders of the religions (sects etc.) want only to gather around themselves as many people as possible. That brings them more power, influence, honor, and money. They understand very little of what is really written in the Scriptures because they are Shudras or Vaishyas. But even what they understand/ know, they do not preach to the people, but what the masses like to hear - and that is nonsense. They preach to them (among other things) to seek and find peace, rest, contentment, and happiness on earth?! Whoever seeks such things on earth and in the earthly items, searches in the wrong place and will never find it. The earth is not a \\"paradise\\" and was not created for such a purpose. Peace, Rest, Contentment, and Happiness reside in much higher spheres, so they should be sought there. God did not create the earth so that the people on it may live in contentment and happiness. The whole earth is a battlefield, the field of Kurukshetra(m). The human body is it, too - and on both levels, one has to wage war (but not a bloodshed war) if one wants to try to break out of the samsara. People on earth are the \\"exiles\\" from the \\"heavenly places\\" where unity, harmony, and bliss reign. It is completely foolish to search and expect such conditions on earth. Just look at the long and sorrowful history of people on earth. The last \\"few years\\" of relative well-being (in some countries) should not make you forget everything and mislead you. Life on earth has been a constant struggle for this and that from the beginning (apart from shorter periods), and it will remain so - until its demise. The episodes from the past and sorrowful history will be repeated, and it will become even fiercer. The End is near. God has created the worlds and the world inhabitants, and He develops what He wants and whom He wants - further. The earth is a temporary appearance, and so is the life on it. In the beginning and in the past, it was about the settlement on earth and reproduction/ spread. For many years, however, it is about the return to God. That is an individual thing, foreseen/ destined only for a selected number of selves - not for the nations or communities. When God has developed and perfected all His own (whom He wants) on the earth, He will bring them back to Himself into eternity, and then He will let this world pass away, He will destroy it/ it will no longer exist. That is the future/ the destiny of this world and those who remain too long bound to it. Therefore, one should try to forget the earth and its joys/ pleasures / loves that bind him to it and seek the closeness of God. Only in that way will one be able to escape the final perdition. ___________________________________________ - The VEDIC Teaching/ Teaching of GOD \\"He who has NOT RECOGNIZED, but has only heard or read many things, CAN NOT UNDERSTAND the meaning of the Scriptures, just as a spoon knows nothing of the taste of the soup.\\" The Chandogya Upanishad \\"When one RECOGNIZES something, he speaks the TRUTH; he who does not recognize does not speak the truth; only he who recognizes speaks the truth. Recognition, therefore, one must seek to Recognize.\\" (I love such sentences: \\"To Recognize the Recognition\\".) Ninth Khanda: And he (student) came to the abode of the teacher (guru). Then the teacher addressed him and said, \\"Satyakama!\\" - \\"Venerable!\\" he replied. - You shine, my dear, like one who knows Brahman. Who can it be who has taught you?\\" \\"OTHER THAN HUMANS*\\", he replied; \\"but Your Honors may explain it to me, please. For I have heard men like Your Eminence say that Knowledge which one learns FROM THE TEACHER leads the surest/straightest to the goal.\\" (This TEACHER is \\"OTHER THAN HUMANS,\\" and His Teaching leads most surely/ straightest to the goal. This is Brahman/ God. He is the Only true Teacher. And He Himself is called Guru, Sadhguru, Yogi, Teacher, Purusha, Mahapurusha, etc. in the Scriptures. But only a few (true) Vedic Selves recognize this (in contrary to innumerable so-called Hindus), whom God/ Brahman lets recognize it, in contrast to the masses who seek earthly teachers/ gurus and remain with them in Samsara; in ignorance, darkness and death - until the definite downfall/ perdition. They are the teachers/ gurus/ priests of the masses. God personally gave them to the masses because He wants to keep the masses away from Himself/ from His salvation-bringing Teachings through such gurus. After all, they deserve such teachers/ gurus/ priests.) In an Upanishad unknown to most of you, God said: \\"If I find anything good in your hearts, if I find virtue in you, I will give you more than has been taken from you, and I will forgive you.\\" (i.e., I will set you free/ save you = Moksha.) That kind of Selves God seeks among the masses - to save them. The Kathaka Upanishad (or Katha) Not by instruction* is the Atman attained, (* from an earthly guru) Not by understanding and many scriptural teachings; ONLY whom He CHOOSES, by him He is comprehended: To HIM the Atman makes MANIFEST His being. (Whoever wishes to receive Knowledge from Him, to become a true Vedic man, Veda knower, must walk through all four stages of life (Ashramas). Only through that one can reach Brahman. Everything else is only theoretical knowledge/ book stuff. Just as well, one can read science fiction, belletristic or similar instead of God's Scriptures. These four stages of spiritual development (= four Ashramas) correspond to the four castes (Varnas). This has nothing to do (as the earthbound ignorant think) with family affiliation/ blood relationship, the profession one pursues, and the like. He who does not ABSOLVE ALL FOUR stages of life/ development remains a true Shudra or Vaishya - until his definite perishing.) The Paramahamsa Upanishad Who, giving up all lusts, In the SECONDLESS, in the SUPREME, stand, Carrying only Recognition as his rod, He is rightly called the one-rod-man. (I love this expression \\"The Secondless\\". There is no better way to emphasize that He is ONE. Do not be misled by many of His attributes, aspects, functions, names, and forms of His appearances.) (God/ Brahman refers to Himself in His Scriptures as: Guru, Sadhguru, Purusha, Mahapurusha, Yogi, etc. But if you want, you can find an earthly guru and - as commanded in the Hindu (man-made) Guru Gita - drink the dirty water in which your guru washed his stinking feet. Moreover, you should gift him money, a car, and the like - as you have also been commanded to do.) - The Bhagavad Gita (Vedic Teaching) The Teaching is available to everyone, but it is meant for and understood ONLY by the WORTHY. According to Vedic Teaching, there are four ages/ stages of man: \\"Brahmacharya\\" - disciple, \\"Grihastha\\" - family man, \\"Vanaprastha\\" - hermit, and \\"Sannyasa\\" - ascetic. If one understands this interpretation of action and takes just a few steps further - which one can do only in his third stage of life - then the seed of action is sown forever, and this seed can never be destroyed. O Arjuna! Then nothing on earth, not even a weapon, can refute this seed, that is, this Truth. Arjuna was Kshatriya. The Exalted One spurs him to become a brahmin. Brahmin and Kshatriya are our innate qualities. Our courses of action determine our dispositions. This cannot be inherited by tradition, by virtue of our birth into a certain family. He who has seen the soul face to face is the true Brahmin. ... This soul of yours is omniscient and undestroyable. The soul is undestroyable, except it everything is destroyable. Offering fire to the gods, living an ascetic life, performing a sacrifice for thousands of years - all that is in vain if you do not know the undestroyable. Ignorant, he dies, and with him, I have pity because he is really poor. (as Gautama Siddhartha was) \\"O Arjuna! If one cannot renounce the world and must remain attached to everything, then one cannot act selflessly. And this is a cause of affliction.\\" If you do not take even the first step on the path of yoga, then this is impossible. \\"He who meditates on the Exalted, whose mind and senses have settled, such a meditator, by the power of karma-yoga, can shortly attain to the Absolute.\\" \\"He who performs all his deeds devoted to the Supreme and dwelling in the Supreme, who acts abandoning all his worldly attachments, his actions do not shackle him. As a lotus flower remains untouched by the mud.\\" You must have noticed that the dirty water surrounds the lotus flowers day and night, but the lotus flowers floating on the water are not even touched by a drop of water. Thus, the godlike one lives in the world but is redeemed from worldly bonds. He acts for the good of humanity, for his descendants. \\"The yogi acts by renouncing their senses, their spirit, their mind, and also their body.\\" The soul: \\"It does show itself, in the hour of passing away, and also when the body enjoys the sense objects due to the three Gunas, but the soul is not recognized by the ignorant foolish. Verily, it is recognized only by those who possess the special, knowledgeable power of sight.\\" How does one obtain this sight? \\"The yogis experience the striving soul when they are in the process of taming their mind. But the unfinished souls, i.e., those with an impure interior, cannot see, despite their efforts, because they are still CONSTRAINED WITH THE WORLDLY THINGS. Only the pure are capable of this sight. God says further in the Bhagavad Gita: NEVER TELL of this Teaching of the Gita, revealed ONLY for YOUR BENEFIT, to one who does not practice ASCETICISM and who is not devoted. Nor to one who does not listen or speaks ill of Me or objects to this Teaching. This SECRET Teaching is not meant for everyone at random, but ONLY for the PRIVILEGED, WORTHY, LOVING BELIEVERS. It is NOT INTENDED for others, considered ORDINARY people who FULFILL their WORLDLY tasks and DUTIES. Think only of Me, believe only in Me, be only faithfully devoted to Me, so devoted that tears come to your eyes when you pay homage (especially at prayer), and offer your homage only to Me, then you will surely reach Me. This I truly promise you. The average/ ordinary man does not reach this state. The average/ ordinary man does not reach the Highest. Whoever worships Me lovingly and imparts this Teaching to My followers will reach Me. Among people, no one is dearer to Me than the one who spreads this Teaching. (only to the worthy ones) By performing the true prayer unceasingly, the spirit experiences a constant upsurge. For a better understanding of this stanza, the meanings of the following words will help us: Brahmanvit: one who recognizes Brahman, an enlightened one for whom God has become real. Vidvar: a high-minded one (one on the second level. Vidvishta: a High Scholar (one on the third level. Vidvarishta: a Most Highly Venerable One, one who has experienced the highest Recognition of the Divine. With the help of these words, let us now try to understand the following passage. In the first stage, the mind is called Brahmanvit, i.e. the mind that recognizes the Brahman. After eliminating the debilities, it gradually reaches the stage of Brahmanvidvar, i.e., the high-minded one. With still further ascent, the mind refines itself and then reaches the state of Brahmanvidvarishta, i.e., the state of the most high-minded. Now the one with the most exalted mind is entitled to help others to ascend. (Only one who is at this stage of development can help others to ascend. Only he is a Guru. And he can only give advice. But the receiver cannot understand and adopt anything if God/ Brahman does not want that.) The highest degree of mind is attained by the Brahmanvidvarishta, i.e., those who have experienced the arising in Brahman. The Secret Teaching is not meant for everyone, but only for the privileged, worthy, loving believers. But not for the other, normal/ ordinary people fulfilling their worldly duties. They will NEVER be able to see Him. There are only two kinds of beings: the IMPERISHABLE and the PERISHABLE. Perishable beings are those who wander in the world as birthing and perishing bodies - may they be seen in the male or female bodies. On the other hand, the IMMORTAL state of the Purusha appears only after he has acquired the exalted Knowledge and progresses. Perishable and imperishable are the two kinds of people. To the first belong those condemned to DEATH, and only the imperishable is immutable. He who remains the same by virtue of his tamed spirit and the tamed senses, only he is imperishable. This one belongs to the HUMAN SORT. Beyond that, there is still One/ Better than the two, however, is still One, the All-Best, who permeates the three worlds, sustains and nourishes them. He is the imperishable, exalted One. He is God. \\"In all the universe, none is dear to me, and none is disgusting to me. But my believer DWELLS IN ME and I IN HIM. That is the ONLY family relationship I recognize. This I call the PERFECTION, then the believer stands at no distance to Me.\\" All beings and things that are sattvic, rajasic, or tamasic originate from Me. They are in Me, but I am not in them. \\"From my unmanifested being, the whole world is permeated,\\" i.e., in my primordial form, I am omnipresent. \\"All beings dwell in me, but I am not in them. For I am in my unmanifested form.\\" \\"Actually, all beings do not dwell in me, for they are mortal and dependent on nature. So, recognize the magnificent power of my Yoga-Maya.\\" He said: \\"I, who am the origin and nourisher of all beings, but do not dwell in them, for I am the Supreme Being, and they do not arrest me.\\" \\"But the STUPID PEOPLE, immersed in pleasures, worship, instead of Me, other NON-EXISTENT GODS. But in order to STRENGTHEN their devotional faith, I, assisting them, accept their prayers addressed to stone-trees-waters and reward them. But the GODS are NOT, and NEITHER is the REWARD.\\" (\\"Neither is the reward\\". He misleads many people. You will see the same practice in the Gospels and in the Quran/ Koran, too. God strengthens them, giving them good feelings (also in their demonic meditations), so they believe that it is good and valuable for them. However, they do not know what the Vedic word \\"meditation\\" really means, what it encompasses, and how to perform it. They have adopted the Gautama's demonic/ earthly kind of meditation.) Krishna said, \\" Starting from Brahma (Brahma is not Brahman with \\"n\\" = true God) to all living beings, all are subject of rebirth. Even at the end of all this, you cannot count on the remission of births.\\" The name \\"Krishna\\" means \\"one with dark skin color\\". Therefore, the name \\"Krishna\\" is inappropriate/ unacceptable for Him. (One must not take him for an earthly person/ One must not imagine him as an earthly person - neither with dark nor with bright skin color.) Krishna said, \\"To end suffering, one thing has TO BE DONE: let go of the attitude that it is about ME. It is not. It was, is, and ALWAYS will BE about GOD."},{"prompt":"What are easy recipes to learn if I don't know how to cook or even prepare basic dishes?","completion":"Learning to cook can be a fun and rewarding experience, as it allows you to prepare delicious and nutritious meals for yourself and others.

But a desire to go home to their family at the end of their shift. They don’t do it as an act of aggression but an act of caution. Police officers don’t go to work hoping they can shoot someone. But quite the opposite as most officers go through an entire career not firing their weapon in the course of their duties. And that’s the way they want it to be. But in the course of their duties, they will come into contacts with a huge range of people from very good to the lowest form of scum to walk the earth. So when making a traffic stop or answering any kind of call they don’t know what they might be facing until they’ve had a chance to talk to the people involved and find out for sure what type person they are in the presence of. So they have to proceed with caution. They could pull over an average looking family car with the intent of telling them they have a brake light out. Not knowing the actual owner of the car is dead in his driveway and the person driving his car is the one who killed him. And is on a multi-state crime spree. This guy might be waiting for the officer to reach his window before shooting him. And since police officers aren’t psychics and don’t have x-ray vision they need to be prepared for the outside chance this is a dangerous person. Because this isn’t a game they’re playing and there aren’t any do-overs. If someone heard a knock on their door in the middle of the night they are going to take some kind of precautions before they just open the door. Not because they think it has to be a criminal, but just to be careful. But if you take into account all of the police officers in a years time are attacked while doing their job you might understand why they are careful. But you have this whole culture now of people who seem to think anything a police officer does is a part of some big conspiracy. An I keep saying the same thing. Go out on a police ride along for an entire week. Including weekend and despite the weather and see first hand what they deal with and why they do certain things. Then shoot your mouth off once you have a tiny clue of what you’re talking about."},{"prompt":"Do we have the theory of everything? If yes, then what is the equation?","completion":"No, we do not.

I am like you, I deeply wish Valve would make more games, but that seems to not be happening anytime soon."},{"prompt":"What is the formula for sport betting?","completion":"The key to successful sports betting is knowing the injury report, trends in a players game from game to game. Leading up to the game your betting on. If the star players are not consistent, do not bet on that team. If you want win bets on sports, don’t look at espn. Read the local newspaper of that team. Why? Because they follow the team with passion. So, you’ll find out secrets about the team that other people won’t know about outside of the state where the team plays. If the coach of the team usually wins big games, that’s another reason why you pick a team to win. Because when it’s crunch time, lessor coaches will falter almost guaranteed. It’s why a Nick Saban type coach always wins. If the coach is over 75 years old, do not bet on that team. Why?

Kristi Noem South Dakota suing the Biden administration over fireworks at Mt. Rushmore as the agency in charge says the Sioux don't want it, it starts fires, environmentally negative, COVID19 and in general inappropriate?","completion":"There is nothing more appropriate than celebrating the 4th of July at Mount Rushmore. South Dakota has a lot to celebrate this year. Thanks to vaccines and natural immunity the worst of covid-19 seems to be over. In stead of acting like a dictator or a king ( like most democratic governors ) she treated her constituents like adults. Kristi Noem has done a great job leading her state through covid-19, New York and California would love to have her as governor. Look what's happened to California under “ Prince Newsom \\" , under the guise of public health he's ruined his state's economy and is facing a recall. New York's governor is a national disgrace, he's ruined his state's economy by keeping everything shut down and is being impeached. That's why South Dakota love's Kristi Noems leadership. Schools have been open since August and businesses never closed. If Biden wants to unite the country ( as he's always saying ) he'll go to Mount Rushmore take off his mask and burn it. Kristi Noems would make a great president, maybe in 2024 she'll be the one to unite the country because Biden has failed."},{"prompt":"What scary gut feeling did you have that turned out to be true?","completion":"I live in Montana and do a lot of Mountain Biking. Over the years I have seen bear, moose, elk, badger, cougar and more deer than you can imagine. Really, Im most wary of Moose. They have these long gangly legs, huge antlers on the males and are generally a crabby group as a whole. I've been most frightened by Grouse frankly. They wait until they are just underfoot and then the make this warble noise when the flush out of the bushes making such a racket you are sure you are being attacked by a bear or cougar or that guy they have been looking for over the years who “ran off into the woods that a way.” After a few bear encounters Ive learned how to handle that kind of interaction and know it is more than likely everything will be ok. One day a few Summers ago I head up a trail called Black's Canyon that's a little off the normal route for most riders as it is a pretty steep climb with little view and an average downhill. I had headphones in and head down, brow furled, i was mashing the pedals just past the steepest part of the climb when the hair on the back of my neck rustled around and I was overtaken with a compelling sense of doom, that something was wrong and something bad was going to happen. I was examining my gut feelings, wondering what they meant when I saw movement on my left and just about 10 yards up hillside of the trail. Turning my head I saw two young cubs scramble up two spindly looking trees. In seconds my mind resigned to the idea that I was probably going to die as mom must be right near as well. I thought about missing my friends, wondered if my pants were wet, lamented that I wasn't going to get to eat the fresh baked cookies I had at home and that this was going to be messy; when I saw mom. She was huge. She stood, front paws on a stump just 10 yards of me uphill. She stood there watching me intensely. When she saw I noticed her and we made eye contact she opened he mouth and letting out a ghaslty growl as she gave me two head pumps while also lifting her front paws and aggressively slammed them back down on the stump. It was like she was asking or telling me rather, “Your choice buddy, but I'm ready to do whatever I have to for my cubs.” Having been given notice I turned my eyes to the ground, dismounted my bike, turned it around, slowly got back on my bike and rode off back down the trail. Looking back Id had the bad feeling all day about something I was going to have to make a decision about and the wrong decision was not good. It helped me learn to listen to my gut and those kinds of feelings generated there. So I'm always aware"},{"prompt":"w many gun owners have actually stopped a crime from being committed by using a gun?","completion":"It’s not an easy question to answer. Vast percentages of defensive gun uses are not reported to authorities. From those that are reported, and from surveys (which not all people will answer honestly) it is estimated anywhere from 500,000 to upwards of 3 million times a year guns are used in self defense. Dr. English just published a survey of 2021 defensive gun uses, and found around 1.67 million times people used their guns in self defense. The FBI will tell you about 400 crooks are killed in self defense uses every year. So you draw your own conclusions about how many shots are actually fired - most often the crooks decline to be perforated so run away. [LINKED_TEXT: 2021 National Firearms SurveyAbstract This report summarizes the findings of a national survey of firearms ownership and use conducted between February 17th and March 23rd, 2021 by the professional survey firm Centiment. This survey, which is part of a larger book project, aims to provide the most comprehensive assessment of firearms ownership and use patterns in America to date. This online survey was administered to a representative sample of approximately fifty-four thousand U.S. residents aged 18 and over, and it identified 16,708 gun owners who were, in turn, asked in-depth questions about their ownership and their use of firearms, including defensive uses of firearms. Consistent with other recent survey research, the survey finds an overall rate of adult firearm ownership of 31.9%, suggesting that in excess of 81.4 million Americans aged 18 and over own firearms. The survey further finds that approximately a third of gun owners (31.1%) have used a firearm to defend themselves or their property, often on more than one occasion, and it estimates that guns are used defensively by firearms owners in approximately 1.67 million incidents per year. Handguns are the most common firearm employed for self-defense (used in 65.9% of defensive incidents), and in most defensive incidents (81.9%) no shot was fired. Approximately a quarter (25.2%) of defensive incidents occurred within the gun owner's home, and approximately half (53.9%) occurred outside their home, but on their property. About one out of ten (9.1%) defensive gun uses occurred in public, and about one out of twenty (4.8%) occurred at work. A majority of gun owners (56.2%) indicate that they carry a handgun for self-defense in at least some circumstances, and about 35% of gun owners report carrying a handgun with some frequency. We estimate that approximately 20.7 million gun owners (26.3%) carry a handgun in public under a \`\`concealed carry'' regime; and 34.9% of gun owners report that there have been instances in which they had wanted to carry a handgun for self-defense, but local rules did not allow them to carry. The average gun owner owns 5 firearms, and handguns are the most common type of firearm owned. 48.0% of gun owners have owned magazines that hold over 10 rounds, and 30.2% of gun owners -- totaling about 24.6 million individuals -- have owned an AR-15 or similarly styled rifle. Demographically, gun owners are diverse. 42.2% are female and 57.8% are male. Approximately 25.4% of Blacks own firearms, 28.3% of Hispanics own firearms, 19.4% of Asians own firearms, and 34.3% of Whites own firearms.https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3887145] [URL: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3887145]Example a good friend of mine, gassing his Harley one evening, was being approached by 3 toughs indicating they “liked” his bike, “a lot”, and wanted it.

In the past, entrepreneurs were often seen as lone wolves, taking risks with their own resources and going it alone. Today, however, entrepreneurs are often part of a larger team, often working with outside investors to build their businesses. The question of whether or not all entrepreneurs need an outside investor is a difficult one to answer. On one hand, outside investors can provide the capital and resources needed to launch a business and help it reach its full potential. On the other hand, entrepreneurs can sometimes be successful without outside investors, as long as they are willing to take risks, work hard, and be creative. The answer to this question will depend on the type of business and the goals of the entrepreneur. For some businesses, outside investors may be a necessity."},{"prompt":"the Indian economy in a real crisis?","completion":"Boost Indian Economy Even before the COVID-19 outbreak, the global economy was struggling against trade-protectionism, US-China trade wars, European uncertainties over Brexit and falling commodity and energy prices. Though the number of new confirmed cases is starting to level on a global basis, the real picture is fragmented as different countries are in very different stages of the pandemic. The statistics emerging from the situation are not heartening. During the lockdown, 140 million Indians have lost their jobs. As per a Barclays research estimate from April 14, the lockdown cost Indian economy approx 26 billion per week. The same agency on March 24 had estimated that the lockdown would cost India 16.6 billion per week. The discrepancy goes to show that predictions are not an exact science given the dynamic nature of the situation and it would be better to err on the side of caution. Averaging all estimates, GDP growth for 2020 is likely to go down to a negative 0.5 percent, the worst since economic liberalization in 1991.

Are you still stuck with questions like - \\"Where do I start?\\" \\"How do I get better?\\" Don't worry, here is a guide that will help you answer these questions. What is Competitive Programming? Competitive Programming is a programming sport involving many participants competing with each other to achieve better results. It helps enhance one’s mind and develop analytical and thinking skills. Competitive Programming is more common now than ever before. There is currently an active, competitive online community of programmers and a variety of competitions take place every week. At the same time, competition difficulties are rising. Benefits of Competitive Programming Here are benefits of competitive programming: Competitive programming helps you to improve your logical and analytical skillsIt improves your algorithmic knowledge.It is an excellent addition to your CV.Improve your network of friends who are also passionate about programmingIt is supported by world famous organizations like Google, Amazon, Facebook, IBM, and others. How to get started with CP Prerequisite: Determination/ Dedication Step 1: Choosing your language The language should be preferably C++ or Java, the last preference should be Python (due to its unavailability on many official coding platforms, e.g., the ACM ICPC). The reason is that time of execution is a critical factor in Competitive Programming. Choosing a language whose time of execution is fast is sure to give you an advantage. If you know C, it is effortless to get started with C++. It is recommended to shift from C to C++ because of C++ features compared to C. Step 2: Learn the Language I would recommend practicing problems, as many as you can, you'll be able to learn stuff as the need arises. Start any YouTube playlist like – Python for beginners. You do not need to know advanced concepts, like classes or generics/templates. You should know if/else, loops, arrays, functions and have some familiarity with the standard library, like math functions, string/array operations, and input/output. Next go to HackerRank and solve problems based on the language. Step 3: Start with Problem-Solving Every day, there are more and more platforms that support competitive programming. There are many excellent platforms from which to choose when starting out. Starting with HackerRank and Atcoder is what I'd advise (Beginner). It contains the easiest-to-use IDE and tasks for learning and honing basic problem-solving abilities as well as mastering the languages. The following platforms are also strongly advised: CodeforcesCodeChefAtcoderTopCoderHackerEarthLeetCodeSPOJProject Euler Personally, I believe you should choose any one of the websites, and stick with it for sometime don’t jump around. I myself used to solve questions on Codeforces, initially I will recommend beginners to go on the problem tab inside Codeforces and sort out the problems based on submission (greater the number of problem submissions, easier is the problem), solve the first 3 – 4 pages to get a hang of competitive coding. Start from square 1, build up your confidence, start from the most solved, and keep going. Generally, 'A' problems would be the easiest, followed by B, C, and D. Remember, you're in Div2. Look for the Division, Div1 A’s are equivalent to Div2 C’s. You might end up doing a very difficult ‘A’ problem. As a newbie, you should never care about rating because that is your biggest barrier in trying harder and trying problems out of your comfort zone during a competition. Even if your rating is going down, it doesn't mean you aren't improving; rating is relative to others and isn't a sole factor of what you can do. The key is: PRACTICE Don't stop even if you get stuck. Get help immediately. Do one or more of the following: Try to find other people's solutions or read the editorial. Get the main idea of the solution. Now CLOSE the solution and implement yours without reading the solution again. This is quite important so that the algorithm/solution will sink into your head. Step 4: Learn Data Structure and Algorithms To move forward as a competitive programmer, Data Structures and Algorithms will be your long-term partner who will help you solve problems with low time and space complexities. Learning time complexity analysis The time complexity of an algorithm is the algorithm’s amount of time to complete its process as a function of its input length, n. The time complexity of an algorithm is commonly expressed using asymptotic notations: Big O, Big Theta, Big Omega Here are some important online courses you can explore: Logicmojo, Scaler, Educative etc. Data Structure is a way to store and organize data so that it can be used efficiently. While solving a problem, knowing which data structures to use can make a significant change in time complexities and decide your solution’s fate. Here are some Important Data Structures to learn: ArraysLinked ListsStacksQueuesBinary TreesHeapsGraphsTriesHere is a list of Popular concepts for competitive coding:SearchingSortingMathematical AlgorithmsGraph AlgorithmsGreedyDivide and ConquerDynamic Programming Many of us make the common mistake of solving many problems and not giving enough time to learn new concepts. It is essential to constantly learn and also revise programming concepts such as data structures and algorithms. It is recommended to follow a simple rule: For every 3 hours of problem-solving, allocate at least an hour to learn concepts. Step 5: Participate in Contest There is no better practice than actual contests. Contests help with your ability to contain your stress and will test your strengths to the maximum. After each contest, make sure to solve all the questions that you did not solve during the contest. This is a key point. Let me define “Stuck” for you. Stuck is a state when you have completely tried your level best, all ideas you have had have failed, and you can't think of more. Your rating doesn't matter. Once you put your rating to a side, you'll be more aggressive in solving. Rating would automatically improve as you improve. Once you're comfortable with A and B level problems, try pushing for C, then push for D. Don't stop. Push harder, you'll definitely be good someday. Prestigious programming contests As a competitive programmer, one can aspire to participate and win global-level challenges and represent your college/country. These competitions allow young talented programmers to measure their capabilities and compare themselves with other programmers worldwide. ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)Google Code JamGoogle Hash CodeGoogle Kick StartMicrosoft Imagine CupFacebook hacker cupThe International Conference on Functional Programming Conclusion Competitive coding has both been fun as well a a source of frustration, but the former is dominant. I would think that programming entails more than just writing a few lines of code. Code debugging is the real deal. You are an expert at coding if you are skilled at debugging. And you really need a lot of experience and dedication to become an expert in debugging. I am thankful to Logicmojo for providing me with the right material, assignment, and test to keep me engaged till I did not learn. It takes a considerable amount of time before you get good at it. You have to keep yourself motivated throughout. Forming a team and practicing is a good choice. All the best!!"},{"prompt":"What are the steps in writing a dissertation?","completion":"A thesis (or dissertation) could be arranged as a thesis by publication or an essay, with or without appended documents, respectively, though many graduate programs allow candidates to send a curated collection of released documents.

This was in a for-profit hospital where I think that the security wasn’t exactly great. Two security staff walked out of the hospital, looked down the street to the left, looked down the street to the right, shrugged, and walked back into the hospital. I was so afraid for that guy. He was in extremely bad shape. I was worried about him walking out in front of a speeding car without realizing it, though many other things could have happened as well. For example, my friend’s son shot and killed a social worker when he was in really bad shape. He really liked that social worker, too.

The point of the Kobayashi Maru is to experience the unwinnable situation. Many members of Starfleet are hyper-successful. They’re the best of the best, the most over-achieving over-achievers you’ve ever seen. Athletic, supremely intelligent, and driven. The Kobayashi Maru is a means to introduce cadets and junior officers to facets of the real world, and in real life there are times when you can’t win. Life isn’t just a scaled-up version of some academy test, it’s bigger and more dangerous and there guarantees that there is a right answer among the options. Also…you can die. There’s a good reason to introduce young officers and cadets to all of these concepts. The Kobayashi Maru is the in-universe way Starfleet did this with some students. It would never work though. The key factor in making the Kobayashi Maru test work is that the people taking it would need to think the test was legit and solvable. Serving an overachieving cadet a hot bowl of failure to digest is the whole point, and once everyone knows that the test isn’t beatable then it loses all its psychological power. That feeling of surprise and failure that Saavik experienced in The Wrath of Khan is the point. The very question of whether Data could “pass” the Kobayashi Maru test misunderstands it. There’s no “passing” this test, there’s simply experiencing it and hopefully gaining some maturity and perspective from the experience. Data couldn’t pass this test, because no one can pass it. Even Kirk didn’t pass it, despite his legendary bit of cheating. Starfleet commended his ingenuity, but otherwise the victory meant nothing. It wasn’t some test that he had to pass before becoming a captain, it was just an experience that Starfleet gave its cadets to better understand themselves and their new role."},{"prompt":"With how hard it is being an undocumented immigrant, why not just give them citizenship?","completion":"Guess how many new undocumented immigrants that would create."},{"prompt":"What is chutiya in Hindi?","completion":"[LINKED_TEXT: What is the meaning of the word, \\"Chutiya\\"?https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-meaning-of-the-word-Chutiya-2] [URL: https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-meaning-of-the-word-Chutiya-2]"},{"prompt":"What are some UX basics that every software technology entrepreneur must know?","completion":"Nobody knows how to use the newest tech"},{"prompt":"What would you do if you woke up beside Kamala Harris?","completion":"Wash the sheets"},{"prompt":"w can I get clients for my content writing business?","completion":"There are huge loads of customers out there right now seeking enlist freelancers for writing administrations.

Listening to 60s pop/rock I'm impressed by how many instruments seem to fit into the mix compared to when I use synths in a DAW.","completion":"So much great information here already! Budgets were much larger back then, and time constraints on a lot of big budget albums allowed as for more than a year or two on some albums, which is completely unheard of today, where a mix may come down to hours, or a day. Engineers were taught to EQ through mic placement, mic selection, positioning the source in the room, as well as modification of acoustics. This is still done today by great engineers, and where budgets allow. Players did an amazing job of controlling dynamics through their playing/singing, and studios did not have racks filled with compressors, nor did consoles have dynamics on every channel strip, or the unlimited count available In The Box. A great mix begins with a great recording of great musicians, playing a well arranged piece with good to great instruments. That is 80% or better of the battle, and the rest is getting balances, panning, riding faders manually or through automation (adds movement, smoothes dynamics), and any effects processing. You always know when you are working with a truly professionally crafted track, because even shoving the faders up straight across the console sounds good. What you often find these days is, the more faders you push up, the more things begin to step all over each other, and just how much work is ahead. Through a combination of a lack of training under the wing of seasoned pros, misinformation, too many choices through the endless number of tracks, plugins, it has become a \\"Fix It In The Mix\\" mindset.

Assuming a 95% level of confidence and a margin of error of 5%, the minimum sample size needed for a population of 200 million people is approximately 385. However, increasing the margin of error or decreasing the level of confidence would result in a smaller required sample size, and decreasing the margin of error or increasing the level of confidence would result in a larger required sample size. Keep in mind that these are only minimum sample sizes, and larger sample sizes may be needed to achieve a higher level of precision or confidence.

Many things collected in the report only confirm what was already known. For instance, it had been reported that the Trump team had a hand in the distribution of the hacked emails. There were facts to back that up. According to the Mueller report, members of the 2016 Trump campaign had a series of contacts with Wiki-Leaks and people close to its operation regarding leaked Clinton campaign emails, even planning a press strategy ahead of their release, according to Robert Mueller’s report. In the report, Mueller also found that members of Trump’s campaign repeatedly sought to acquire Hillary Clinton’s deleted emails at the direction of Donald Trump himself. This information had surfaced long before the Report was made public. Russian Hackers stole Democratic emails and sent those emails to Wikileaks, who released thousands of hacked emails during the 2016 Presidential Campaign. Than Wikileaks communicated directly with two Trump advisers over Twitter, specifically Trump Jr. and Roger Stone, a long time adviser to Donald Trump. The facts we have indicate that Roger Stone claimed to the Trump Campaign that he had a back-channel to Wikileaks. We also know Donald Trump asked Stone about the Wikileaks plan according to The Mueller report. So we have established that they were aware of what was happening in regards to the hacked emails. It’s also important to note they lied about knowing. The above example was first reported by numerous sources and would later be confirmed in the Mueller report. Just like the Trump tower meeting which had been reported long before the Mueller report, both the reported facts and the Mueller report would confirm it. Since many facts Mueller would release in his report match the facts reported earlier, it would be hard not to believe the report itself. Although there would be some new revelations concerning Trump in the special council’s investigation, the substance of his report accurately matches information already released and made public. Whether the report is the full truth, we cannot know.

You can try searching for these directories specific to the country the number is registered in.Social media search: If the person has linked their mobile number to their social media accounts and has made that information public, you may be able to find their name by searching the number on various social media platforms.Reverse phone number lookup services: There are online services that claim to provide information about the owner of a particular phone number. These services may provide limited information, but keep in mind that they may not always be accurate or up to date.Contact the service provider: In certain situations, law enforcement agencies can contact the mobile service provider with appropriate legal authorization to obtain information about a phone number's owner.

Since you asked me to answer this 14 hours ago, I’m assuming you have read all of the other answers so I will answer from my perspective without repeating the “technical” differences. From my perspective the question should be “What is the difference between granite, marble and quartz. If you are building a home or remodeling a kitchen, my perspective addresses the long term resale value and return on investment aspects and that is why we need to add quartz. Generally people are choosing between granite and quartz. Marble is making a limited comeback, but the risk is that marble has not historically lasted as a trend for very long in the past. It comes and goes and was very popular in the early 90’s. BUT…on resale there were a lot of people who hated it. So the longer term return on investment was nil. People wanted to get rid of it vs pay you for that upgrade. Marble was popular in the early 90’s because gray was popular in the early 90’s just as it is now. But when gray goes out of style…so does the marble. Marble does come in other colors…but most uses are the traditional white with gray streaks or black with white streaks. The in between colors with golds and pinks go out of style even faster and the greens…well, just don’t. Being Italian I love marble. I once had a black and white diagonally set insert done in my foyer with everything around it and through the hallway done in just white. The black and white inset was the size of a large rectangular rug with the tile running in the diamond vs checkerboard pattern. I was careful to choose the whitest marble with the least amount of gray steak and no pink streak and the same for the reverse in black. I hired a craftsman who did a “wet bed” installation…because I’m Italian and of course. :) But years later when gray carpet and gray paint were no longer in style…the buyers asked how they could remove it. I think I chased them out the door with a rolling pin! Gray is back again and so much so that many of the new vinyl-woods are gray toned. But the trend won’t last as long as granite has and even when in style, it is not as appealing to all tastes as granite is. This is why I mention quartz. The real choice today is quartz or granite and not really marble or granite. Marble is for someone who loves it (as I did) AND who plans to die in their house without depending on other people liking it when they sell. For white and even black, quartz is more the product of choice because it has fewer if any color streaks. It’s those streaks that go out of style vs the type of surface. There are pros and cons to each of these products, but on balance they are about the same and the quartz gives you a higher return on investment. Now to granite. Granite can also give you some headaches with the color streak disparities. It’s a natural product and a sample size doesn’t give you the full story. The more of it you need, the more likely you will get a piece that has a drastic “imperfection” to the naked eye. You literally have to pick your slab of granite to get it right, and many professionals who install it don’t choose wisely because they make more money if they can give you that slab no one wants because of the odd streaks. Here’s a good example of a really odd color streak pattern in a granite countertop: And here’s one where someone chose the right granite from a small sample, but ended up with a pattern that to some looks like a defect: This granite is the MOST used and gets the least number of complaints…but it doesn’t go well with today’s modern trends. The above granite has been popular since 1998 or a bit before and so that is still good, but clearly a trend that has passed for the most part. Still can be used with the right house in the right place, but not with a modern home or a modern decor. If your house or decor is modern or mid-century modern, and much of it is these days where I am, think quartz. It’s clearly the forward thinking choice. Less porous so better for keeping bacteria away in a kitchen, but also less resistant to heat…so use heat pads under hot dishes and pots. Here’s a good article on quartz: [LINKED_TEXT: Reasons Why Quartz is the Leading Countertop Material] [URL: http://minahventures.com/reasons-why-quartz-is-the-leading-countertop-material/] But if your two choices are granite or marble…both may not be a good trend choice 5 years from now if and when you want to sell. If you are going to live in your home forever…buy whatever you like. From a resale perspective or if your design is in any way modern…go quartz. The white of it has some speck and design, but is more uniformly white and much more universally accepted than traditional white marble with gray. OR you can do what I did, hand pick your white marble so as to have NO pink and the least amount of gray grain. If you are a huge fan of white, Carrera marble, as I am, maybe limit it to use in the Master Bathroom where the trend lasts longer and stay away from it in the Kitchen and elsewhere in the house. If you never plan to sell and have a good idea you will stay where you are for 20 years…buy whatever you like best!"},{"prompt":"w can I solve a puzzle which is currently too hard for me to solve?","completion":"First how much interest you have about a puzzle .I tell you about myself when someone ask a puzzle from me and I do not know the answer .Every time I think about that puzzle and want to find the answer until I find the answer myself or someone tell me its answer.2nd did you have solve the same puzzles before or other puzzle .Experienc can make you good in solving the puzzle .you can think about it from different point of views which a common person may be not thought while some people are naturally genius and they solve it quickly.You can solve the puzzle by thinking about the puzzle from different points of views you have not thought before .Moreover you can find the answer by sharing the puzzle with your friends ,Facebook groups or on quora.You can share the puzzle here on quora.I hope you will find your answer. one puzzle for you .

Over the holidays, I visited some of my extended family with my eight-month-old daughter. I was excited to show them how much she had grown. I sat her in my aunt’s lap and said, “She learned to clap last week! Watch this!” I looked at my daughter. ”Can you clap, honeybee? Clap clap?” I said to her directly, clapping my hands together, knowing it had prompted her to clap back at me in delight many times before. She stared back at me blankly. ”Clap? Clap clap?” Nothing. With a chuckle, I said to my aunt, “Sorry, she’s tired from the traveling and being around new people. I swear she does it all the time!” Shaking her head, my aunt replied, “You’re ‘sorry’? Honey, she doesn’t have to perform. I’m just glad she’s not screaming and putting up a fuss!” She doesn’t have to perform. I told myself I would never be that parent. I would never pressure her or smother her with unrealistic expectations. Instead of constant criticism, she would be showered with love and proclamations of pride for her being just the way she is: good enough. I had spent much of my life resentful and angry because I had felt criticized, scrutinized, unaccepted, held to robotic standards. I would never perpetuate that cycle, no, not me. Yet here I was, apologizing that my infant daughter didn’t clap on command like an abused circus monkey. ”She doesn’t have to perform,” was a single phrase, but it spoke volumes to me. It was a much-needed reminder to accept my daughter as she is before unwittingly using her to seek others’ approval. I would never expect her to apologize in this situation, so there was no need to apologize on her behalf. Thank you, Aunt V."},{"prompt":"What's the most ridiculous thing a coworker told on you to your boss for?","completion":"I used to work with a woman who was always looking for ways to get ahead.

We were working on a team project, and I was responsible for putting together a report that we were going to present to our boss the next day. I was working late to finish it, and my coworker came in to check on me. She saw that I had a bag of chips on my desk and accused me of eating at my desk, which was against company policy. I explained to her that I was just snacking while I worked and that I would clean up before I left. But she didn't believe me and threatened to tell our boss that I was violating company rules. I didn't think much of it at the time, but the next day, our boss called me into his office and asked me about the incident. My coworker had gone to him and told him that I was eating at my desk and not following company policy. I explained to him what had really happened, and fortunately, he believed me. But it was frustrating and ridiculous that my coworker would go to such lengths to make me look bad. It was clear that she was just trying to make herself look good in front of our boss.

A: Well… The James Webb Space Telescope can see the past, but not all the way to the Big Bang. The reason is that the speed of light is finite, meaning that it will take time to get to the eye or sensor which will perceive it. The more distant the object you are looking at is, the further back in the past is the image you see. So when you look at the Moon, you see it as it was about a second ago. When you look at the sun (use proper protection), you see it as it was about 8 minutes ago. When you look at the closest neighbouring star, Alpha Centauri, you see it as it was 4.5 years ago. When you look at the Andromeda Galaxy, you see it as it was 2.5 million years ago. The earliest light we can see is from 13.799 billion years ago. That’s almost at the Big Bang, but not quite: it comes from 380,000 years after the Big Bang. The reason is that the early universe was hot and dense, and filled with plasma. Plasma is a mix of atomic nuclei and free electrons. It is not like gas, with atoms consisting of nuclei and orbiting electrons, but the electrons are so energetic that they cannot stay with the atoms. So they zoom freely about. As a result, plasma is opaque. At 380,000 years after the Bang, the universe had expanded and cooled, meaning that electrons could stay with their atomic nuclei. So the universe became filled with gas instead of plasma, and therefore cleared up. It is called the Recombination Era. The earliest light is actually the afterglow of that plasma prior to the Recombination Era. However, as the universe expanded, so did the light travelling through it. We call this cosmic redshift. The afterglow of the plasma has redshifted so much that it is no longer light, but microwaves. And it looks like this: The earliest proper light we can see is this: The red blob in the box is a magnification of an object called GN-z11, a galaxy so far away that it is redshifted so much that we can barely see it, from about 400 million years after the Bang, shortly after the end of the so-called Dark Age of the universe where there was no stars. At the time, it might have looked something like this: It is estimated that GN-z11 is about 1% of the mass of the Milky Way, 4% of the size of the Milky Way, and that it formed stars 20 times faster than the Milky Way. In many ways, GN-z11 challenges our theories of how galaxies formed in the early universe. So to understand how the first galaxies formed, we would like to see even further back than GN-z11. The problem is that the light from that era is shifted to the infrared, which means that ground-based telescopes are severely limited because the atmosphere is good at blocking infrared light. Hubble is built to watch mainly in the visible spectrum, and is limited by its 2.4 metre mirror. We have had infrared telescopes in space too, like Spitzer, but its mirror is even smaller than that of Hubble. So what we would like to have to study the formation of the first galaxies is a ground-based telescope with a much wider mirror, but in space so that infrared is not blocked, and with instruments specifically adapted to watch in infrared. That telescope is James Web Space Telescope. It will not allow us to see the Big Bang, but it will allow us to see the first galaxies form. And not only that: it will also allow us to study objects much closer, literally in a new light. These two images are of the same object, both by the Hubble Space Telescope. The one to the left is in visible light. The gas and dust blocks a lot of the interesting stuff, but it can be seen in infrared as in the image to the right. However, Hubble is limited to the near infrared. JWST is capable of seeing in the far infrared and with a much larger mirror. It will be able to see through that dust much easier and produce much more detailed images, allowing us to get even better data and better science of even close objects. JWST may even allow us to view distant planets around other stars directly."},{"prompt":"Why do some people like to stay in an abusive relationship?","completion":"People may stay in unhealthy or abusive relationships for various reasons, even though it may seem counterintuitive to an outsider. Here are some common reasons why people may choose to stay: Fear: Fear of the unknown, fear of retaliation, or fear of being alone can keep individuals trapped in abusive relationships. They may worry about the consequences of leaving, such as increased violence or harassment from their partner.Emotional attachment: Despite the abuse, some individuals may still have strong emotional attachments and love for their partner. They may hold onto the hope that the person will change or return to the loving behavior they exhibited earlier in the relationship.Low self-esteem: Abusive partners often use tactics such as manipulation, gaslighting, and degradation to erode the victim's self-esteem and make them feel unworthy or incapable of finding a better relationship. This can create a sense of dependency on the abusive partner.Financial dependence: In some cases, individuals may rely on their abusive partner for financial stability, shelter, or other basic needs. The fear of being left without resources can make it challenging for them to leave the relationship.Isolation: Abusive partners often isolate their victims from friends, family, and support networks. The lack of external support and limited social connections can make it harder for individuals to seek help or envision a life outside the relationship.Cultural or religious factors: Cultural or religious beliefs and societal pressures may influence individuals to prioritize staying in the relationship, even if it is abusive. They may fear judgment or stigma from their community or worry about the impact on their family's reputation.Stockholm Syndrome: In some cases, victims of abuse may develop a psychological phenomenon called Stockholm Syndrome, where they form an emotional bond with their abuser and may sympathize with or defend them.Cycle of abuse: Abusive relationships often follow a cycle of tension, abuse, and reconciliation. After an abusive incident, the abuser may apologize, show remorse, and promise change. This \\"honeymoon\\" phase can give the victim hope and reinforce their belief that the relationship can improve. It's important to remember that leaving an abusive relationship is a complex and individual journey. Support, understanding, and resources are crucial for those who are experiencing abuse. If you or someone you know is in an abusive relationship, encourage seeking help from a professional, a helpline, or a support organization specializing in domestic violence.

While it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized advice, here are some general tips that may help alleviate lower back pain: 1.Practice good posture: Maintain proper posture while sitting, standing, and walking. Avoid slouching or hunching over. 2.Exercise and strengthen your core: Engage in exercises that strengthen your abdominal and back muscles, as a strong core provides support for the lower back. Activities like yoga, pilates, and swimming can be beneficial. 3.Stretch regularly: Perform gentle stretching exercises to improve flexibility and relieve tension in the muscles of the lower back. Consult with a physical therapist or a qualified trainer to learn specific stretches that target your back. 4.Maintain a healthy weight: Excess weight can put additional strain on the lower back. Aim for a healthy weight through a balanced diet and regular exercise to reduce the stress on your back. 5.Use proper lifting techniques: When lifting heavy objects, use your legs instead of your back. Bend your knees, keep the object close to your body, and avoid twisting motions. 6.Take breaks from prolonged sitting: If you have a sedentary job or lifestyle, make an effort to take frequent breaks to stand, stretch, or walk around. Consider using a standing desk or an ergonomic chair that provides lumbar support. 7.Apply heat or cold therapy: Depending on the cause of your pain, applying a heat pack or an ice pack to the affected area may help reduce inflammation and provide temporary relief. 8.Avoid high-impact activities: If your back pain is severe or acute, avoid activities that involve jarring movements or put excessive strain on your back, such as running or heavy weightlifting.

What about when the clinician first talks to the engineer?","completion":"Keep notes showing whom you spoke with that gave you the ideas for the various parts and/or features of the device. Do not rely solely on electronic files to track your ideas to creation. Use an official “lab notebook” that has numbered pages so you can prove that you wrote your notes in chronological order. Do not cut out or tear out any of the pages. This shows your continuity of development from concept to finished product. Then, if you have any stumbling blocks during the patent process or any lawsuits after you have your patent, you have handwritten proof in addition to any remaining electronic files to prove how you devised the product. You can also insert what ideas you tried, which ideas worked and which did not work. Including these items demonstrates your ongoing and active development through all processes. If you speak with someone about an existing idea that you are developing, but there is no significant change to the development, you can simply make an entry that states the date, whom you spoke with, if it was on the phone or in person. Any further notation is up to you. You could include minor notations, such as “discussed potential problems” or “discussed automatic feedback circuit”. Optionally you may want to track that start and stop times of meetings with multiple people, or the duration of phone calls. If you make several phone calls researching a topic (e.g. marketing representatives), you can put in a notation such as date, then either “1325–1505, telephone calls to various marketing firms” or “1.5 hours, drafted diagrams.” There is no general rule by which to track your idea in the early stages. Be as detailed or general as you want. Many people do not realize how much they have devised already before they start writing notes. Consider writing an entry for when you start and when you complete documents, such as a business plan for your new business, or the user manual, or a quick reference guide (if applicable). In my opinion, you cannot start too early, but you can definitely start too late."},{"prompt":"What's the most creative way you've seen someone discipline their children?","completion":"As a foster mother, I had quite a few children, including my biological kids. Each child was different. The sibling groups were the most challenging, as they constantly argued, fought, tended to express intense jealousy and used foul language towards each other. They acted as though they truly hated each other. Every Friday, I had all the kids sit at the dining room table. Each child had a pencil and paper on which to write all the complaints they had against another child. They were to write their gripes: no foul language and no insults. They had to get really creative to find words they could use to express their displeasure. Instead of insulting they made up funny and hilarious ways to describe what they thought of the other child. Each child was allowed to read their letter of complaint out loud. Everyone had to listen respectfully. Initially, the letters were full of anger and accusations. Over time, the letters became full of silliness and great humor. We would all laugh. One day during a parent-teacher conference, the teacher of one of the girls excitedly told me how “Kiley’s writing has greatly improved. She tells the funniest stories.” Who knew this technique would improve the child’s writing in school? It also made a great difference in the way they expressed themselves and increased their expressive vocabulary. It was one of the experiences that brings a smile to my face.

People who lived 100 years before it lived so different from people 100 years after it that the former couldn’t hope to recognize the latter. And make no mistake: the average person was immensely better off for it. Why do I bring up the Industrial Revolution on a question about Christianity? Because the rise of Christianity was for morality what the Industrial Revolution was for science and economies: a paradigm shift for humanity that pre-Christian thinkers would’ve had a difficult time imagining. Hyperpatriarchy Imagine if you were born in those days. You had a cleft palate: relatively harmless but it was an unsightly physical deformity. How long would you stay alive? Not very long. Father dearest would have you chunked in the woods and the wolves would eat you. Or suppose you were a married woman. Then one day you did something that angered your husband. Or maybe he just got tired of you. Invoking his right to pater familias, he put you to death. See, pagan societies were founded upon on one maxim: “the strong take what they will and the weak suffer what they must.” The strong included the man of the house. The father of the house. The master of the household slaves. And of course, society as a whole emulated this abusive family model at every turn. Sexual Ethics People like to suppose that Christian sexual ethics concern prohibitions of things that have no moral consequences. But nothing could be further from the truth. Promiscuous sex between consenting adults still poses a risk of STDs like gonorrhea, which if contracted by pregnant women can cause permanent blindness in newborns. Or chlamydia, which causes stillbirths and sterility. Or herpes and hepatitis. These things were a surefire ticket to ruined lives before the invention of the condom. The only way to mitigate this risk without dying a virgin was to limit sexual activity to one’s own spouse. But never mind that. “Consent” was not in the pagan dictionary. Some people like to bring up the pareto principle in reference to all sorts of things. Let me apply it to the world’s oldest profession. The youngest prostitutes were having most of the sex. More specifically, child prostitutes. Leftover daughters who who were sold by their families. A man steps into the room. A man steps out of the room. Another man in. Another man out. Day in. Day out. Day in. Day out. Oh, she’s pregnant? The pimp kicks her stomach until she miscarries. Then another man in. Another man out. All until she’s “old and used up” around 17 years old. Then she has zero life prospects. Red light districts before Constantine were centers of child rape. And while the New Testament imposed no minimum age for marrying, it did prohibit extramarital sex of all kinds. For all human beings. This meant that, so far as children’s bodies were still being sold for sex after Constantine, it was necessarily illicit and illegal as opposed to something that was openly tolerated. But what if a girl avoided this fate? Well, there was probably a good chance she’d just be molested by her father, uncles, and brothers instead. From the first sign of puberty in all likelihood. Perhaps she could live a decent life as an adult but the price of admission would be hell. Polygamy But, you might reason, surely this pagan landscape would be paradise if you were a man, right? Well, no. Because odds were high that you were born a surplus male. See, even the most consensual polygamy in the world is no victimless crime. As it almost always involves a man wedding several women and not a woman wedding several men, it almost always creates an artificial shortage of women. Notably, Mormon polygamist sects in the present day have been known to kick young men out of the community because all the women their age were taken by the promiscuous elders. Let’s face it: your life probably sucked. Farming was backbreaking work and there was no entertainment. Learning was off-limits for most people as well. Which meant pretty much the only thing a man had to live for was having a wife and kids. But under a polygamous framework, this was next to impossible for many. Sadly for them polygamy was ubiquitous and unassailable in the world they were born into. The New Testament, in contrast, strongly implied that polygamy ought not to exist. And the church acted accordingly from its earliest days. By enforcing monogamy, it gave 90% of men a shot at a decent life, and it gave women a better shot at a partner who treated her as a person as opposed to an object to be acquired. Slavery Though unfortunately this achievement did not survive the Dark Ages, the early church did outlaw slavery in the late Roman Empire. Public Executions In Ancient Rome, the amphitheatres were hotbeds of depravity where the average citizen gathered to watch condemned persons, often innocent people, be tortured to death. It set a daily precedent that human life was cheap, and partaking in this pleasure surely desensitized the audience to cruelty. Christians, holding that all humans were made in the image of God and thus assigning a sacred value to everyone, outlawed these games once and for all. The early church also pioneered history’s first mass expansion of public hospitals."},{"prompt":"T Madras mess has introduced separate entrance, utensils and basins for nonvegetarian students, some of whom are considering it as equivalent of 'untouchability'. What are your views on the matter?","completion":"Before giving a strict yes or no as an answer, I would like to clarify that I am a non vegetarian but I have my friends who are vegetarian and all these while I have seen that they do have a problem with sharing of utensils with non vegetarian ones. They feel that it is same as eating non veg. About using the same water tap, I don't think they have a problem, but they do have a problem with food being cooked in the same utensil as of non vegetarian or sharing the same plates which are used by non vegetarians. So, according to this, the conclusion comes out that they want their food to be cooked in separate utensils and they want separate plates which are not used to eat any kind of non veg. And IITM has given them exactly what they wanted. Let us now come to the other side, the non vegetarians. I am sure every non vegetarian has a vegetarian friend for sure. Do you like to make your friend uncomfortable? Can you share your chicken piece with them? Can you share your plate with them in which you had just had a fish? No, right? So, just generalise things. Think of everyone as your vegetarian friend. You can eat veg but they can't eat non veg. I feel that it's perfectly fine if they have been given separate plates and basin. I don't find any point to which they are reacting saying that this makes them feel like untouchables? Well, why dude? Why would you feel that? Your vegetarian friends need their space. So your mess has given them their space. I think it's a great move and I don't find any point to discourage this move. And this is nothing to feel bad about."},{"prompt":"What should writers know?","completion":"Every aspiring writer should know that writing is hard work. It requires dedication, focus, and an open mind. Writers must be willing to accept criticism and learn from it. They should also remember that there is no one \\"right\\" way to write - it is an individual process, and each writer has their own style and method. Writers should also be willing to experiment with different techniques and approaches, and be open to evolving as a writer. They should be familiar with the basics of grammar and punctuation, and strive to improve their writing skills. It is important to read widely and take time to reflect on one's own writing.

My sister starts fidgeting. Sit still. Movie goes on. Sister squirming. Sit still! Somethings crawling on me, she says. Don't be stupid. Sit still. After much squirming I yank her out the seat take her to the ladies rip off her dress to prove nothing was crawling on her, when the biggest cockroach I've ever seen drops out of her dress. I jumped on it and obliterated it into a green carpet. Poor little thing she was. See! I was so ashamed. I bought a box of pop corn and she was quiet as a mouse as if nothing had happened. Everytime I see one I get the same remorse and jump on it. Burned into my soul. Creepy thing!

My understanding is that the vast majority of knighthoods come as nominations through the Prime Minister, although, in rare cases, the monarch might be able to bestow one on their own, but it would not surprise me if they would clear even that with the government as a matter of courtesy. Whether someone from another country could get one, would depend on the country. For example, Canada does not allow its citizens to accept knighthoods, so high-level decorations like the Order of the British Empire might be given. I’m guessing any foreign ones would either come from the UK government or at least be vetted by them because it would be stepping into foreign affairs territory. I’m certainly open to correction on any of this."},{"prompt":"ving at 62, I have no pension. I haven’t payed enough in for old age pension and I am alone. What will I do?

There is such a thing which is called “fake compassion” or “fake sympathy” - when the person says they are sorry but don’t actually feel it. Such people wouldn’t also offer help, for example. Genuine people don’t just say things, they show in actions that they believe in it. Another point is that they show initiative and don’t expect anything in return. Because some might help you to make you pay them back later. A genuine person would never even hint at it. They are even capable of being truly happy for you if something good happens in your life. You’ll see it in the absence of any signs of envy, negativity or fake smiles around you. A genuine person would also not avoid clearing the air if something needs to be resolved. They wouldn’t attack but try to resolve it in a peaceful way. They would not choose to resent you for something and hold a grudge."},{"prompt":"w can I download magazines for free on the Internet?","completion":"There are many books that have the potential to be life-changing, as their impact often depends on individual preferences, experiences, and personal growth.

Those are not fair statements when someone is in an abusive relationship. There are both physical and psychological reasons for remaining in an abusive relationship. Abusers are very controlling people and often allow very little autonomy to their victims. They can be isolated from their family and friends and have a very limited support system to help them. Fear of being hurt or killed is often a concern for the victim, as often abusers tell their victim that if they leave, they will find them and harm them. When children are involved this makes that threat even more frightening. Another form of exerting control is financial. Often abusers control finances and victims have no access to resources needed to leave Psychological reasons are just as strong as physical reasons when someone stays in an abusive relationship. The first is general self esteem or self worth that has been stripped away by the abuser. They have been told so often that they are worthless and could never make it on their own, that they end up believing those things are true. So , they believe they need the abuser to survive. These messages can be very strong and become incorporated into one’s self perception. There is often what is referred to as The Abuse Cycle. The abuser abuses the victim, then apologizes, often treating them well for a short period of time. Of course this is short lived, and the abuse starts again. These short periods of being sorry are treating their victim well create false hope and victims want so badly to believe the abuser, they get seduced back in. The bottom line is that leaving an abusive relationship is a complicated and difficult thing to do for many reasons.

Rather than just blocking the connection, they are more likely to look at the domain being requested using whois, which can give them access to your name and address even if it is not stored in their cache of previously seen requests. This only works so long as they have records for domains that were previously requested by you, though some people will pay for private access where this data is not available on the network logs.

But if for some reason the grid lost all of its workers, it would shutdown within a few days as the US grid is mostly fossil fuel powered. Coal stations would be the first ones as they require a full train load worth of coal every day or two. Even if the mines had a massive stockpile of already mined coal people are required to load / offload those trains and feed it to the power stations. Natural gas fares a little better as its pipelined in. But its hard to store a month’s worth of national gas production. It just takes too much damn space. Nuclear would be fine maybe for a year. Reactors can usually go on for 18 months without refueling. Hydro dams might keep working for a decade non stop. The transmission and distribution grid to keep working. Unless something destroys that, the grid itself will keep working for months/years until a transformer blows out. Some critical people would be required to operate those reactors/dams, and the grid, but less than 10% of the workers in the electricity grid work in managing the grid versus those allocated to maintaining it. A well maintained system needs periodic maintenance so you don’t risk it crashing. But in a pinch you might be able to go on for 6 months to a few years without maintenance depending on the type of equipment involved. A pandemic is an economic disaster but not a physical disaster. People that must work will keep working.

For example: I love getting outside and studying my surroundings. Feeling the grass and dirt between my fingers soothes me, and smelling the fresh air after a storm wakes my mind in ways that nothing else can. Or drawing. Drawing for me is a way of noting what I ave observed, or simply displaying my bottled up emotions through art. Such as when I am angry, I tend to draw fearsome creatures that show off their large canines or long curved claws. When I am happy, I love to draw things that capture my interest and have lots and LOTS of detail. Like a creature with feathers AND fur AND scales that one of my friends challenged me to draw and so on. And when I am sad, I like to draw things that are emotional yet simple. like water color art, or simply water.

What would it take to actually harness the power of the atom? By that I mean, use the radiation directly without so many conversions, i.e. radiationheatsteammechanicalelectricty?","completion":"Nuclear reactors DO harness the power of the atom, you’re just misunderstanding how EXACTLY enough. The radiation produced by nuclear fission isn’t the primary release of energy, it’s a necessary byproduct & a hazard that must be dealt with. The majority of the energy that comes from every atom that fissions is over 200MeV of KINETIC energy (heat) imparted on the FISSION FRAGMENTS that used to be the nucleus of the atom that fissioned. That might not seem like a lot of energy but 235 grams of U-235 contains about 6x10^23 atoms. The radiation released by gamma radiation isn’t insignificant, but it’s also turned into heat. Those fission fragments are unstable & they will give off decay gammas, more heat. The neutrons released by the fission are born “fast” over 2MeV each & in order to cause another fission they will dump that kinetic energy into moderator atoms, more heat. Heat is the “coin of the realm” for extracting energy from nuclear reactors. Better heat engines would be great to increase efficiency, but remember first & foremost, it’s the kinetic energy of the molecules, not the radiation that does the work."},{"prompt":"What are the things you shouldn't share on social media?","completion":"You can avoid sharing such sensible details of yours like Your addressYour phone no.(unless it's made for this.)Your car numberYour adhar numberPassport informationYour personal security numbersYour credit/debit card numbers.

Trust me, it is a brutal cycle, and ultimately, our bodies pay the price with more pains, more aches, and more stiffness. But there is good news; you can make things better by applying a few habits in your day to day while studying. Here are points to consider for the best position to sit in during study session: 1. Always Sit in Proper Posture During the study session, give support to your shoulders and back by adjusting your hips backward as far as they can go. But, keep in mind that you don’t lean much and always sit straight to avoid pain. 2. Adjust the Seat Height The height of the seat should be high enough that your feet are flat on the floor. So, avoid sitting too low (strain your neck) and too high (cause pain in the shoulder). 3. Support Back and Armrests Make sure that your back is always supported, and you give rest to your arms in every short span of time. Also, don’t forget, you should always avoid sitting in the same position for more than 30 minutes as it hinders the proper blood circulation. So, you can take a short stretch break to relax your body for a while. With the study chair, the study table also plays a significant role.

An anchor rode made of chain is far heavier than rope and this aids in anchoring, both by its weight and by its angle of strain. Chain will lay across the seabed more easily than a rope, and thus make the strain from the anchor more parallel to the sea bed, causing it to bite or hook better into the sea floor. So lighter is not better. Furthermore an anchor rode is always subject to chafing and abrasion as it lies on the sea floor with surface waves and tides pulling and releasing it. A rode made of rope would fray as the motion of the sea moves the rode back and forth over rocks on the sea floor. A chain is obviously much more resistant to wear and tear. [Edit: Just to clarify - \\"The vessel is attached to the anchor by the rode, which is made of chain, cable, rope, or a combination of these. The ratio of the length of rode to the water depth is known as the scope. Anchoring with sufficient scope and/or heavy chain rode brings the direction of strain close to parallel with the seabed.\\" Wikipedia]"},{"prompt":"Why did Will Smith slap his costar at the Oscars?","completion":"Chris Rock's Netflix Special: Woke Culture, Meghan Markle, and the Oscars Slap During the special, Rock shared his thoughts on the incident, jokingly claiming that he took the hit \\"like (Manny) Pacquiao.\\" He also addressed the idea of \\"selective outrage,\\" suggesting that Smith's actions may have had more to do with his personal relationship struggles with wife Jada than with Rock's Oscar's joke.

Inaccurate demand forecasts typically would result in supply imbalances when it comes to meeting customer demand. Forecast accuracy at the SKU level is critical for proper allocation of resources. When we talk about forecast accuracy in the supply chain, we typically have one measure in mind namely, the Mean Absolute Percent Error or MAPE. However, there is a lot of confusion between Academic Statisticians and corporate Supply Chain Planners in interpreting this metric.

Are dogs in carts a sanitary problem?","completion":"In the USA we have the Americans with Disabilities Act. That allows a service animal to go ANYWHERE legally allowed with its handler. A service animal can be a dog or, and I admit Im a bit fuzzy on this one as its changed, a miniature horse. There are special restrictions on the miniature horse. Any other animal is NOT a service animal but rather an Emotional Support Animal. The difference is an ESA is not required to be held to the same behavior standard as a Service Animal, they also have less legal protections. An ESA is NOT allowed to be in grocery stores or restaurants. Yes people lie about it all the time. There are only two questions by law an employee can ask someone with a dog in the store. 1. Is that a service animal? and 2. What does it do to aide you in your disability. As funny as I find it answering Asshole detector and its about to go off don't work. It has to be a legit service, such as my Frog is being trained to sense when I am about to have an anxiety attack AND to interfere and stop the attack OR lesson its length and severity. I have PTSD and MASSIVE anxiety issues with it. The store cannot ask you what your disability is, they cannot make you demonstrate what your dog is trained to do to aide you. They cannot ask, indeed there is no documentation, for you to provide documents of either your disability OR your dogs training. If a store asks a well behaved service animal to leave there could be a MASSIVE lawsuit over it. The store would not win unless it could prove it was NOT a service animal and or they did not discriminate against a disabled individual. If an employee of a store asks ANYTHING but those two questions there could be a massive lawsuit .. . . see above so I dont have to retype it all. In MY opinion if a dog is riding in the cart, barking and its not an alert My human needs help bark, sniffing around, dancing around, snagging things off shelves it is NOT a service dog.

Embassies don’t like ambiguities! If you had a refusal in Canada, and you are applying any country, please disclose this information. Mentioning about your Canadian Visa refusal doesn’t weaken your profile in any way, it’s just the embassy will look at it meticulously. A refusal from one country doesn't invalidate your chances to study anywhere else. Every country has different immigration rules and regulation. A visa refusal is not just a blunt outcome on the spot, but acceptance or rejection of a visa depends on so many internal factors as well. If you closely see the refusal for Canadain visa is all-time high now and the entry requirements for the college/universities are soaring as well. Similarly, at one of time, the UK has many refusals but in the last 2–3 years time, there is rarely any refusal. Rejection is sometimes based on the number of reasons, cap of the number of visas achieved, the university region (e.g. Toronto has more refusals than Quebec), ministry of labour’s stats and needs for a particular type of audience, and many other. So don’t worry if you had a refusal in Canada, do put a cover letter explaining that it was a general refusal or if you have a specific refusal reason, do mention that but don’t ever hide it, even if it gets refused. But if a visa gets refused for misrepresentation or falsifying the information, it becomes really hard to get any country visa. The game is mostly over! I come across a multitude number of calls every now and then, people asking if they can apply to some other country as they have a ban of 5 years or 10 years from a specific country for providing fake documents or forging the information. And sometimes, some consultants do it without their knowledge. It’s not recommended! Remember, rejection with the right information is a hundred times better than a rejection with the wrong information! If you don’t understand this, ask someone who has got a ban! In the year 2009, in an official conference called, Five Country Conference (FCC) permitted the exchange of immigration and biometric information between all the countries that participated. The participant countries were the UK, the USA, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand to combat illegal immigration and other possible immigration threats. This was just an example, in most cases, they have the immigration information available. So please disclose all the travel history and refusals at least the experience you had internationally. If you did something locally that they might never know and there is no such system in place but if you have travel or got refusal for an international transition, it’s better to disclose to be safer side.

Some women still choose to wear it, along with the hijab. But it is by choice, not regulation. Women now own companies, work at companies and are CEOs. Prince Mohammed appointed the first female ambassador to the United States. He has also appointed other women to high positions in the government. Public entertainment was sparse in Saudi Arabia, until Prince Mohammed. Now there are sports stadiums, concerts with Western pop stars, plays, festivals, restaurants from all over the world and more, to be enjoyed by both men and women together.

Get a “Dogs for Dummies.” What kind of dog to get First off, Google, “What kind of dog to get?” On the first page will be a dozen or so sites offering quizzes offering to answer that question. Take a few tests or take them all to get an idea of what you want and what you are willing to sacrifice to own a dog. Read carefully the pros [advantages] and the cons [disadvantages] of the breeds you think you’d like to own. The pros are oversold, and the cons are understated. Good luck. My personal favorite is small (45#) female Standard Poodles. Standard Poodles are medium size of 15 inches and taller (to 22 inches); males weigh 45 to 70 pounds, and females weigh 45 to 60 pounds. (I like them on the small side 40 -50#) Please note, only the Standard Poodle is an excellent family dog. Miniature poodles tend to be very high strung and not suitable for families with children. Standard Poodles are smart and gentle and are suitable for children with allergies. Aside from not shedding very much, and being hypoallergenic, poodles are virtually odorless. No dog smell here! The life span for healthy Standard Poodle average 12 to 15 years. The average cost for all Standard Poodles starts at 1,000. Or you can layout a lot more for a puppy of champion stock. Check the AKC website for more information. Maintenance [grooming, food, toys, etc.] is about 3 - 4 dollars a day. Some last pointers. NEVER buy from a pet store, because 9 out of 10 puppies come from a puppy mill where the parent dog live a hellish existence.In my experience, seven out of eight-pound dogs have been good pets.Check out several breeders. Meet the parents of the puppy. You choose the sex and let the breeder select the puppy best for you. 4.

And this chase for best and its debate is similar to the famous old discussion on Mac vs. Windows vs. Linux, and in the present day scenario, we know that there is a place for all three. However, for professionals and aspirants from respective fields who are in search of the best Data Science platform to build their careers and organizations which makes advanced analytics capabilities, this is an excellent question staring at them and that's general. Python: a general-purpose interactive, interpreted, high-level and object-oriented programming language, supports structured and functional methods and Object-Oriented Programming Languages and probably used for scripting like scripting language for building large applications. It is also capable of providing high-level dynamic data types and supports automatic garbage collection and dynamic type checking. It can for quickly integrating with COM, C, C++, ActiveX, JAVA, and CORBA. SAS: the undisputed market leader in the space of financial and banking analytics. This program offers significant statistical functions of distinct variety with great GUI for individuals to enable quick learning and supplies technical support that is amazing. SAS is an expensive alternative and isn’t appropriately enriched with updated statistical functions. R: It is a SAS’s open-source counterpart that has especially applied to professors and researchers. Since R is an open-source framework that immediately releases updates. Plenty of documentation accessible over the web and is available at budget-friendly prices. Industrial use of Python, SAS, and R: Data science capabilities: SAS is extremely efficient at sequential data access, and database access through SQL is also well integrated. The drag-and-drop interface makes it easy for you to create better statistical models quickly. It has great functional graphical capabilities, but it’s difficult to create complex graphical plots in SAS. R is known for In-memory analytics and is mainly used when the data analysis tasks require a standalone server. R is an excellent tool for exploring data. Currently, R has more than 5000 community-contributed packages on CRAN. The wide range of packages and modules available for statistics and data analysis makes it the most popular and powerful language in data science. Statistical models can be written in a few lines of code. You can draw complicated graphs beautifully in R using packages like Ggplot2, lattice, rCharts, etc. Python libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, and Scikit-learn makes it the second most popular programming language in data science after R. You can also create beautiful charts and graphs using libraries like Matlplotlib and Seaborn. Python is actively used by the machine learning community to scrap and analyze unstructured data from the web. [LINKED_TEXT: I Python notebook] [URL: https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/notebook/] – a web-based interactive environment – makes it easier to share your code with another. Ease of learning and flexibility: Python gets full marks even though it is a scripting language due to its flexibility and simplicity it provides to the users along with intuitive syntax. Python has become the new phenomenon in the data analytics toolkit and with its friendly-analytics libraries. Choosing Python is not a time taking the task, it does make you can allocate it some time to master. Its overall leaning is difficult to medium. SAS is the most comfortable language across all three to learn and can be picked up by anyone without a prior programming language. The ability to parse SQL codes, integrated with macros and other native flavors makes SAS discovering a child’s play for individuals with primary SQL know-how. R has a slightly steeper learning curve compared to SAS and Python. Since R is a low-level programming language, it requires proficiency and basic programming orientation. If not correctly implemented, even minor tasks will become a Herculean and involves complex code lines. Its overall learning can be considered as average to high. Big Data effectiveness: Most companies seek end-to-end applications when it comes to Big Data instead of standalone analysis. It is the primary region where Python over SAS and R wins the thunder. It is a proven fact that Python is the only language that Hadoop-Spark supports apart from JAVA and Scala. Similar to Python, R has excellent integration with Hadoop and offers parallelization capabilities, and in the case of analytics, it is the best fit for large-scale machine learning. In the present years, SAS is providing distinct options to execute analytics within Hadoop without moving cluster data but includes flexibility with open-source platforms. Python and R stay the first preference for professionals in Data Science. Therefore, SAS needs to run at a rapid pace with the evolving world to remain relevant. Graphical capabilities: While considering data science, graphical capability is a crucial aspect of better data understanding. For this case, R wins hands-down with packages like Lattice, ggplot, RGIS, etc. Even Python has excellent graphical capabilities such as VisPy, Matplotlib, but relatively in comparison to packages in R still labyrinthine. Base SAS in recent times has graphical capabilities improvisation but the available options are still not up to the mark when compared with R and Python. The graph packages of SAS are also not well documented. Hence, R takes the lead here. R is the leading one when compared with the other two.

Nevertheless, R is a must-have tool for aspiring data scientists even if you start with Python. SAS is customized for business requirements and is used heavily by large scale companies. This makes SAS a specific language for business intelligence needs. Python has a growing fan base that keeps it alive and thriving. Thanks to the large community of Python programmers, over 134,740 projects in the Python Package Index (PyPI) exist to serve all kinds of needs. The PyPI repository is like your hardware store, a place to go for the tools needed to implement and finish a project. Academia is fueling the adoption of Python. Computer science curriculums now include Python as a core language requirement.

There are a few things you can do that might help: The most effective way to lose fat in your face is often by losing fat overall. This usually comes down to a combo of eating a balanced diet, getting regular exercise, and making sure you're getting good sleep. Drinking enough water is super important for your health and can also help with weight loss. Plus, staying hydrated can reduce water retention, which might be causing puffiness in your face. If you drink alcohol, cutting back can really help. Alcohol can dehydrate you (which can cause water retention) and is also pretty high in calories. While the evidence is a bit mixed, some people find that exercises targeting the face can help tone the muscles, making the face appear slimmer. One example is opening your mouth wide, then closing it again in a controlled manner. Think of it as yoga for your face! Here are three facial exercises that some people use to help tone their facial muscles: Cheek Puff Exercise: This one's a bit like playing a trumpet. Start by taking a deep breath and filling your mouth with air. Then, transfer the air from one cheek to the other, like you're swishing mouthwash. Continue for a few minutes and then release. Fish Face: Ever make a fish face when taking silly pictures? Well, it's an exercise now! Suck in your cheeks and lips to make a \\"fish face,\\" hold for a few seconds, then relax. Repeat this for a few minutes. This can help stretch and tone your cheek muscles. Jaw Release: This exercise can help define your cheekbones and jawline. Begin by sitting or standing straight and moving your jaw like you're chewing while keeping your lips closed. Breathe in deeply and breathe out while humming. Then, open your mouth wide with your tongue pressed against your bottom teeth. Hold this for 5 seconds, then breathe in and out again.

So, in order to kick the habit, you have to kick them out of your life completely and permanently. For people who have gone through repeated trauma since their childhood, and ended up marrying one or two narcissists I would give recovery time anywhere from 3 to 5 years minimum. Recovery times will vary and I wouldn’t give it a time limit. I know everybody wants it to be a short processing for all the pain to go away. I can promise you the pain does go away eventually, but you have to move through the anger and pain otherwise it’ll stay there permanently. This is your time to finally concentrate on you. It is time to pamper yourself, to give yourself permission to do things in your life that you always wanted to do. And knowing what those are also will take time because you most likely were just giving yourself away to somebody else instead of concentrating on your needs. Good things will come to those who stay the course."},{"prompt":"What are the best VST plugin torrent sites?

I have. Went home for lunch and heard a ruckus outside the apartment. There were two guys kicking in doors and robbing the apartments. They completed two and I went to the peek hole and saw them kicking dow number three right across from mine. I grabbed my .38 revolver and just as I opened the door they were exiting and we came face to face. They saw the gun and started running. I tackled the first and landed on his back with the pistol to his head. He froze so I drew down on number two ordering him to freeze. Number two froze and turned to see the pistol. He was about 50–75 feet away and turned and ran. He was carrying nothing and I had number one so rather than create a mess I lowered the weapon and dragged number one off to the Office with him understanding that he would die if he made a run or tried to fight. There is a good reason we keep our fingers off the trigger. Could have been a Baldwin mess if I had it on the trigger when I tackled him. The Police caught the second guy a mile away. They were stealing guns, jewelry and money. The usual. Glad they dropped everything when they saw me as I would not have hesitated had they endangered my life.

Nuclear explosives would be thrown behind a pusher-plate mounted on the bottom of a spacecraft and exploded. The shock wave and radiation from the detonation would impact against the underside of the pusher plate, giving it a powerful push. The pusher plate would be mounted on large two-stage shock absorbers that would smoothly transmit acceleration to the rest of the spacecraft. These shock absorbers are necessary to provide thrust without jolting the payload with every explosion. In the above image you can the propellant magazines is ejected below the pusher and then detonated. NPP has high specific impulse, meaning it provides more velocity for every pound of fuel. Thrusts were in the millions of tons, allowing spacecraft larger than 8 * 10^6 tons to be built with 1958 materials. A preliminary design for a nuclear pulse unit was produced. It proposed the use of a shaped-charge fusion-boosted fission explosive. The explosive was wrapped in a beryllium oxide channel filler, which was surrounded by a uranium radiation mirror. The mirror and channel filler were open ended, and in this open end a flat plate of tungsten propellant was placed. The whole thing was built into a can with a diameter no larger than 6 inches (15 cm) and weighed just over 300 pounds (140 kg). Details of a bomb capsule. A complex feed and ejector mechanism grabs a bomb capsule from its rack and shoots it out of a chute in the rear of the spaceship. Sixty metres behind the ship, the bomb detonates, in a blast equivalent to thousands of tonnes of TNT. At 1 microsecond after ignition the gamma bomb plasma and neutrons would heat the channel filler and be somewhat contained by the uranium shell. At 2–3 microseconds the channel filler would transmit some of the energy to the propellant, which vaporised. The flat plate of propellant formed a cigar-shaped explosion aimed at the pusher plate. The bomb transforms itself and the surrounding plastic into white-hot radioactive plasma expanding outward at 100 000 m/s. Part of this wave of debris is caught by the thick steel pusher plate which forms the spacecraft’s base, slamming the vehicle forward at 12 metres per second. Seconds later the next fuel capsule detonates and the ship surges forward again, another bomb is ejected and the process is repeated. Each detonation adds an extra 12 m/s to the ship’s velocity and this cycle continues until Orion reaches its cruise velocity. Far above this radioactive inferno, as each bomb explodes the crew experience not a series of bone-crushing blows but a steady, tolerable thrust. Gigantic damped springs, the shock-absorbers, behind the pusher plate smooth the instantaneous acceleration to levels that humans can withstand, say 1–3g. An Orion blast-off would be the most spectacular sight ever created by humans. The ship would have left a trail brighter than the Sun behind it and would be remarkably noisy. About 800 such explosions would get the ship into Earth orbit, the hardest part of any space mission. As the craft moved away from Earth, it would be visible across a whole hemisphere. The orion project was designed to lift an insane 2 million tons to Lower earth orbit However they were a lot of technical and political problems associated with this model. The pusher plate would not withstand all the explosions without erosion, this was later solved by adding a graphite based oil.The cost of building it was astronomical.The bomb ejection mechanism had to be made utterly foolproof as a bomb jamming in the chute would be disastrous.The spacecraft would have left a trail of extremely unpleasant radioactive exhaust behind it. The obvious way to avoid this pollution was to use ordinary rockets to launch the craft into space so that the nuclear bomb powerplant would only be activated far from Earth. However the ordinary chemical designs were extremely inefficient to launch large payloads to space.During take-off, there were concerns of danger from fluidic shrapnel being reflected from the ground. One proposed solution was to use a flat plate of conventional explosives spread over the pusher plate, and detonate this to lift the ship from the ground before going nuclear. This would lift the ship far enough into the air that the first focused nuclear blast would not create debris capable of harming the ship.The partial test ban treaty at that time made the whole project illegal as it included detonating nuclear devices above ground and hence was cancelled.

I am not a resident of Mumbai, I went there last year for an internship. As an outsider, I used to think that yes the local trains might be crowded, but how much. I thought that people are exaggerating this. My uncle talked to my company's head to allow me to come an hour late because I was new to the city and had no experience of traveling in local trains. It was around 10am, I had to go from Borivali to Goregaon. Its some 3 stations away. To my surprise, the train was full. And by full I mean very very full. You could not scratch your head if your hand is down because there's no space to lift it up. I was standing approximately 3 feet near the door. Goregaon station came and since I was new, I had no clue that if you want to get down on a station, then you need to stand in the opposite line. And as a result I could not cover those 3 feets. Although, the people around me sensed the situation, by now they knew that I was new to this city. They advised me to get down at Andheri and board another local to come back. And that's what I did. So, if you are going to me and planning to travel in local trains then be ready to face a huge crowd.

The final decision is made by one person only, person who is carrying an embryo.

If a child is born the father has little if any control over supporting that child. He has a moral, ethical and legal responsibility for that child for 18years, at least.

Often, victims of such relationships suffer from the “I deserve it” mentality. Perhaps, they’ve tried every single way to find other supportive partners. However, leaving co-dependent patterns is never an easy business – not everybody can do it. Many victims of abusive relationships also think of their abusive partners as, “It’s better to be in this relationship than (insert some more abusive patterns here),” particularly when the environment around them has eroded their self-confidence. Loneliness and the desire to experience love Abusers are often experts in trapping their targets to believe that the targets have found their true loves. They can mirror everything about the targets in ways that the targets quickly give in and convince themselves that they are nothing without the abusers’ “help” and presence. Plus, they can sense whether a person is lonely or has suffered in previous relationships. Such things can make the victims confused whenever they want to leave the relationships that are already toxic to them. Often, victims tolerate the bad just so the abusers will start being kind to them the first time they meet. People around them have made their move-outs difficult Sometimes, not being able to leave the relationship doesn’t only involve the victims and the abusers. At some points, people around the victims have made it difficult to move out of toxic relationships. It’s either they mess around with the victims’ phones, mercilessly contact the victims’ other closest ones, or they fabricate stories about the victims that make everybody around the victims believe that they are the crazy and mentally unstable ones.

However, it took me quite a while to work this out and I feel compelled to share my views. The reasoning is a little bit involved, and I am keeping it as brief as possible, so bear with me. Before we come to India, let us consider US history a bit - Roughly about 70 years or so after their Independence, they were fighting a bloody, civil war. States were added to the US, the last one being Alaska? I think somewhere around the turn of the century. During the late 90s (1890s) and the turn of the century, Corruption was rampant in the USA as well. Check out alderman elections in Chicago and New York. Read up on the history of those times in detail. Check out the movie “Gangs of New York”, seemed too violent to be true. Booth capturing in elections, I thought, was an Indian invention, but looks like they beat us to it. The general population in the US those days were not so well off. There was quite a bit of disparity among the rich and the poor. Then came the Second World War, which boosted US economy quite a bit. In a couple of decades, the standard of living in the US became the best in the world … Look around in Europe - Unification of Germany by Bismarck by “Blood and Iron” policy, after which Germany became an imperial power, Italy is unified by Garibaldi and then becomes a major power … there seems to be a similar trajectory in broad strokes in the emergence of nations. In short, a nation has to put together enough people to believe in the nationhood, find some means of prosperity - (mineral wealth, military might whatever) and then there is a mad spree of corruption and abuse by those in power. People who are seeing power and money for the first time in their lives, who have never had any kind of social security and they go nuts. Then the country continues to prosper and eventually some kind of social security is available for most citizens. Now the civic sense improves, country and the officials become more law-abiding and so on … you get “developed nation”, with the attendant sensibilities. I am sure any Indian reading this will see some reflections in the Indian society today. The demographic dividend is paying off for us, most Indian middle class are experiencing comforts which would have been fantastic even 2 decades back. Government revenues and spending are huge and people in power are hauling in like never before. If the prosperity continues (and I am sure it would, as it is based on strong fundamentals), I think India will get to where US is today, in about 2 generations (Social sciences have us believe one generation is 33 years, I have no quarrel with that). Just a typical birth, growth, prosperity curve of nations … I doubt if anyone party or a single government can change these trajectories easily. So, the short answer to the question is - hang on, another 60 to 70 years and you will see today’s USA, here in India. Where the US will be then, of course, is another question …"},{"prompt":"What's the next number in the series: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11?","completion":"1+3=4 4+1=5 5+1=6 6+1=7 7+2=9 9+2=11 11+2=13 Answer"},{"prompt":"After you prepared to retire, what area of your life did not go as planned?","completion":"“After you prepared to retire, what area of your life did not go as planned?” Health wise and financially my wife and I were well prepared, it did take my wife almost a year to unwind her business so her clients were taken care of.

It is believed to create a visually pleasing and harmonious balance. While the golden ratio can be found in many aspects of nature, including the proportions of human faces, there isn't a definitive golden ratio specifically for the distance between a dog's nose and eyes. Although dogs do exhibit unique and often adorable facial features, their proportions are not typically associated with the golden ratio. The appearance of a dog's face, including the placement of their nose and eyes, varies greatly across different breeds and even among individual dogs within the same breed. As a result, there is no consistent measurement that aligns with the golden ratio for a dog's face. It's important to note that the golden ratio is a mathematical concept that has been applied to various artistic and architectural endeavors, but its relevance to biological structures, such as a dog's face, is not widely supported by scientific evidence."},{"prompt":"w does one get officially married if they don’t believe in God?

There is no single entity or group that can be definitively identified as the absolute ruler of the entire world. Instead, the world is shaped and influenced by a combination of various powerful forces and actors, including: Governments: Nation-states and their leaders hold significant power over their respective territories and populations. Governments make decisions on policies, laws, and international relations that can have far-reaching effects.Corporations: Multinational corporations play a significant role in shaping the global economy and have significant influence over governments and policies through lobbying, economic power, and global supply chains.Financial Institutions: International organizations like the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), and central banks hold considerable sway over global economic policies, lending practices, and financial stability.Global Organizations: Entities such as the United Nations, World Health Organization (WHO), World Trade Organization (WTO), and others have roles in promoting international cooperation and setting global standards.Wealthy Individuals: Some ultra-wealthy individuals, often referred to as \\"elites\\" or \\"the 1%,\\" can influence politics, media, and various industries.Intelligence Agencies: National intelligence agencies of powerful countries gather intelligence, conduct covert operations, and influence geopolitical events.Media: Large media corporations control the flow of information and narratives, which can shape public opinion and influence political agendas.Technological Companies: Tech giants have an increasing impact on various aspects of society, from communication and commerce to data management and privacy.Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs): These organizations, ranging from human rights groups to environmental activists, can influence policies and advocate for specific causes.Military Powers: Countries with strong military capabilities have significant influence over regional and global security matters. It's important to note that power structures and influences can vary greatly across different regions and domains. The distribution of power and the dynamics between these entities are constantly changing, making it challenging to pinpoint a single group or entity that exclusively runs the world.

Apart from few rare instances where mathematicians actually found the way to exploit some games (blackjack, I’m looking at you) any game/casino that constantly looses money is run by criminals, extremely incompetent managers or both (doesn’t that remind you of a certain orange vulgarian?)."},{"prompt":"My partner of one month doesn’t like my therapy dog of 10 years. What should I do?","completion":"You and your dog both deserve better. Your therapy dog has been your loyal companion who has loved you unconditionally for 10 years. The person has only been in your life for one month. Only long enough to be infatuated- not long enough to genuinely know what they are like (although are they starting to show their true colours about your dog?). You have a choice - you get rid of 10 years of loyalty and unconditional love or you get rid of someone you met a month ago. To most people who have replied there is no choice - not necessarily because they are dog lovers (although most are) but because it’s 10 years vs 1 month - and because not liking your therapy dog is a huge red flag. Why don’t you call a free helpline or go talk through this with a counsellor? Or even your GP? It sounds to me like there are other things going on for you that might be worth discussing. You sound like a beautiful person. You deserve genuine kindness, respect and love. Your dog knows that. Don’t settle for anything less from another human."},{"prompt":"My family wants to put my cat down. She started being sick a couple of weeks ago by throwing up and peeing everywhere. I don’t want to put her down. Will the veterinarian let me put my cat down even if she is not sick?","completion":"Thanks for the A2A. I am not a vet but I will share my experiences. I have taken two very sick animals to the vet to be euthanized. The vets insisted on examining the cat first to see if there was an alternative. She passed in those few minutes before they had a chance to do the exam. The dog was obviously very old and had hip dysplasia. The vet still looked at him briefly and agreed it was obvious he was in pain and it was his time to permanently go to sleep. These were different vet offices but my experience is that a vet will not euthanize a pet if there is an alternative. Also, cats will stop using the litter box if they are ill. That is one of their ways to let their owners know they need help. She needs to go to vet for help. Edit/Additional comments. I went back and read some of the other answers and comments. I know you dearly love your cat and I admire you for trying to do what is right. Cats can get upset stomachs if they are not given the same food everyday. They need to gradually adjust to a change in diet. If you are feeding dry food during the week and meat on the weekends, she does not have time to adjust to the change. This alone could cause a cat to vomit and is easily changed. Also, cats can tell if someone doesn’t like them and this will create stress and cause them to vomit and urinate and defecate outside their litter box. Call your vet and tell them what is happening. Let them know that you want to help your cat but don’t have the money to pay for anything. The vet may be able to suggest a way to help. As painful as it may be for you, it may be better for your cat if you can find her another home. I’m sure you will miss each other but it would be healthier for her to be in a stress free environment."},{"prompt":"reservation keeping casteism alive in India?","completion":"Yes,Ofcourse reservation system is keeping castesim alive. Hindu scriptures does not say anyting about caste. ‘varna’ system is described which is based on merit and qualities of an individual. Many of our rishis/sages have been of different varnas. Infact sage valmiki who wrote Ramayana is not Brahmin by birth, he was a dacoit who later turned to be a sage. And in ancient India too caste system was no that rigid as it is thought to be. So how the hell of caste system corrupted our society?? simple answer is long history of being invaded by outsiders. First caste based census was conducted during british raj. infact caste word is also not ours, it has been inported at the same time during colonial india. We can say that caste system is corrupted version of jati/varna system. In India muslims and christians too have castes,strange but true. Now caste system has became culture of our country. And its really hard to abolish it because in current scenario politicians use votebank policies to divide people which was done during british time . Now many communities (eg Jats of haryana ,Patels of Gujarat,marathas ) are fighting to get reservations. and it is keeping the reservation system alive. some castes of muslims are also in OBC category. Political parties have clear agenda to get the votes by appeasing some castes/religion. they can do anything to get votes.

Manny – played by Sushant Singh Rajput in what tragically turned out to be his last ever on-screen performance – is afflicted with osteosarcoma, a rare tumour of the bones that has necessitated the use of a prosthetic leg. Kizie Basu (Sanjana Sanghi), on the other hand, is battling with thyroid cancer and frequently needs to lug around an oxygen cylinder (named ‘Pushpinder’, in what is just one of the many bewildering storytelling choices in this film). Both youngsters view themselves as grenades waiting to explode, fully cognizant of the fact that it’s the others around them who will need to face the resulting shrapnel. Dil Bechara is about the interminability of that wait. As informed by Kizie in a voiceover, this is not an “ek tha raja, ek thi rani” type story: morbidity defines this film. In adapting the bestselling 2012 novel The Fault in Our Stars [and consequently the Shailene Woodley-starrer of the same name], debutant director and casting veteran Mukesh Chhabra attempts to transliterate the pathos, the overwhelming humanity of John Green’s tale into an Indian backdrop – but this is eventually a misguided effort that never really finds its footing. Indianapolis is switched for Jamshedpur, Amsterdam is replaced by Paris, “always always always” becomes “hamesha hamesha hamesha”, and an unconvincing sideplot about a has-been author is replaced by an unconvincing sideplot about a has-been musician. Here the leads bond over a shared love for music and Rajnikanth instead of a book, and poor Sushant Singh Rajput is made to utter the word ‘seri’ a dozen times so that the authenticity of his Tamilian background is never brought into question: an ill-advised choice, as you might surmise. Everything is highlighted with the subtlety of a Faber-Castell marker pen. “Can you please explain the seriousness of things to her?” the mother figure played by Swastika Mukherjee vents at one point, to which an oncologist – also referred to as “doctor uncle” – replies, “Travel karna bahut risky hai. Tumhara immune system weak hai.” Saif Ali Khan plays a public service announcement. “Alcohol liver ke liye kharab hai. Nahin peeni chahiye.\\" \\"Cigarette sehat ke liye hanikarak hai. Cancer ho sakta hai.” The supporting characters are completely one-note here, with the pièce de résistance being a dad who keeps tripping on National Geographic for some reason. “Beer piyoge? Beer?” He later pleads with Manny, with the earnestness of a Carlsberg salesman running short of his monthly target. Rajput is first-rate. Ansel Elgort made for a ridiculously charismatic Augustus Waters, and channeling that delicate balance of turmoil, poise and equanimity was always going to be a difficult ask, but the late actor manages to distinguish himself yet again with a performance that’s charming and poignant in equal measure. The cigarette that he mock-smokes is a metaphor for taking Death by the horns: a cruel irony that’s unlikely to be lost on any of us. Sanjana Sanghi, on the other hand, is a refreshing new talent – silent, stoic and resplendent – but there’s a certain rigidity that occasionally seeps into her performance. The film unfolds through Kizie’s perspective, and her overarching outlook on life is, understandably, that of a reality show contestant waiting to be eliminated. She’s good – but then again, a Shailene Woodley she ain’t (yet). The biggest strength of the original film lay in its silences, in how it managed to un-sentimentalize what was, at its essence, a painfully protracted (and genuinely authentic) dance with Death. Chhabra’s direction, on the other hand, feels too staged – there is no room for nuance, and it completely lacks the verisimilitude of its predecessor. Everything feels papered over, and well, Disney-fied, and the fragility of the two leads never really comes through. There’s even an annoying DDLJ spoof thrown into the mix for good measure, and bizarre, inexplicable dialogues like “serial killers aur serial kissers ka yeh favourite spot hai” and “you’ve learnt my full name so quickly – naughty girl” don’t really help in this regard. Which brings us to the inevitable elephant in the room. Malignancy goes beyond tumours – and libel and witch hunts aside, we will never really know the severity of the circumstances that prompted Rajput to take the extreme step that he did. It is destined to remain his Untold Story. To paraphrase the latest fad circulating around on Twitter: the joke is not on us – we are the joke ourselves. All we can do is continue strumming our guitars in unison with him. All we can do is celebrate what was – and ponder on what could have been. India didn’t lose an emperor – but it did lose a prince."},{"prompt":"Do all entrepreneurs need an outside investor?","completion":"Absolutely not! We in startup-land are accustomed to companies that go down the venture funding path, from friends and family to angels, venture capitalists, private equity growth funds, and then going public. Most of those do require lots of outside funding, and entirely self-funded or bootstrapped companies are rare exceptions. (above image: a rendering of Uber’s new world headquarters, currently under construction. You need lots and lots of outside investors to grow a business that big and fast) However, looking more broadly to the history of business in the world, most businesses have started without outside funding. The classic image of the entrepreneur is somebody setting up a tent and selling wares at a public bazaar. (image: a bazaar in Kuala Lumpur. These entrepreneurs probably have no outside investors) The above image shows a father-son entrepreneur team that runs a Minuteman Press franchise in Philadelphia. Like lots of small American businesses they secured bank loans to start. Typical small businesses secure debt financing or leases from banks, private investors, sellers, and equipment vendors when they need to buy expensive equipment or open an office."},{"prompt":"Can Saitama beat anyone from Dragon Ball?","completion":"He can beat most people from og db if you believe he’s only planet surface level.

During the Battle of Pelusium, the seasoned Persian leader Cambyses II - Cambyses II (died 522 BC) king of the Achaemenid Empire, defeated the inexperienced young pharoah of Egypt, Psametik III . In Egyptian culture, cats and animals had sacred status. Cambyses II used a particular tactic during the Battle of Pelusium by exploiting this reverence, using animals, especially cats, for combat use. He sent his army into battle with cats painted on their shields. In addition, Persian forces released large numbers of cats, dogs, and sheep to the front lines. The Egyptians were afraid of harming these animals and were so scared when they saw the Persian soldiers throwing cats at them that they ran away in fear. As a result, the Egyptian archers were unable to shoot arrows for fear of being punished by the God, leading to the fall of the Egyptian army and the capture of the Pharaohs. In addition, there are many leaders with master strategies and tactics in history war and here is an example.

Absolutely, yes. I’ve done it myself, when necessary. Early systems, before an assembler or compiler was available for them, had to be programmed in machine language. New CPU architectures, before an assembler or compiler is available, can only be programmed using machine language. Early microcomputers, like the MITS Altair 8800, had to be programmed in machine language using the front panel, at least to get a loader up and running, from which programs like BASIC interpreters, assemblers, etc. could then be loaded. The earliest BASIC interpreter and machine language monitor for Apple computers were written and entered almost entirely in machine language. One of my jobs years ago involved creating machine language patches that could be applied to executable files in the field, on a minicomputer-based product we developed and supported. I wrote the patch directly in machine language, and adjusted the file’s checksum so that the loader would load the patched executable. I also did quite a bit of programming directly in machine language on my first microcomputer, because I didn’t have an assembler or compiler available. I used a machine language monitor to enter the instructions and data. The machine language monitor was also written in machine language. This video should give you an idea of what it’s like to enter a program in machine language, using a set of front panel switches and LEDs: Today, software developers who develop assemblers or back ends for compilers have to have a solid understanding of machine language for the target CPU architecture. I’ve worked on compiler optimizers that required intimate knowledge of the machine language instruction set and other architecture details. Those who work on embedded systems can also make use of machine language knowledge when debugging at the machine instruction level, when working with a new compiler (which might be buggy), etc."},{"prompt":"What is the most important thing that you observed in the success of Cristiano Ronaldo?","completion":"What is the most important thing that you observed in the success of Cristiano Ronaldo? If you had asked me this before, I would come with the same reasons as everyone else. Like, how he works hard or how he gives his everything. All these points are true and there is no denying that fact. But these reasons were right but never felt just right to me. I mean take the example of his contemporaries : Wayne Rooney and Carlos Tevez. Wayne Rooney gave his 200% on the field. Carlos Tevez was ready to give his everything on and off the field. Though, they were successful too but despite being almost similarly talented the difference between their success and Cristiano’s is significant. How an annoying young winger who dribbled way too much became one of the best in the entire history of football. So one fateful day I saw a video of football pundits taking about him which I almost skipped because I thought they were gonna repeat the same reasons. But Matthew Syed, a british journalist and table tennis player, said these lines by taking Cristiano as prime example: I think that these athletes are deeply paradoxical in that when they are on the stage and they have got a big match they have enough self belief to deliver, they execute brilliantly. But when on the training pitch they have the humility to say, “Even though I am good, I need to get better.” They work on their weaknesses. They build their weaknesses. They have their essential humbleness. He epitomizes these linee. In short, “Even Cristiano is arrogant in the football match, he is the most humble guy on the face of the Earth when it comes to training.” And unlike many footballers, he accepted that this was the only way he would be the best at a very early age. Tevez in an interview proved this point. He spends the entire day in the gym, it's an obsession. I remember that we needed to train at 9, I arrived at 8 and he was already there. So I tried to arrive at 7:30 and he was already there. One time I did everything to get there before him, I arrived at the pitch at 6:30, but he was already there. He was half asleep but there he was.” This humbleness is the price he pays for every arrogant gesture we all see on the camera.

She started being sick a couple of weeks ago by throwing up and peeing everywhere. I don’t want to put her down. Will the veterinarian let me put my cat down even if she is not sick?","completion":"Why don't you just take the cat to a no kill shelter? Explain to your family that this would be equivalent to trying to kill one of them because they got sick and all of the sudden couldn't hold their bladder. As with cats, peeing where they aren't supposed to is also a symptom of their illness,(sometimes the fact that they pee in weird places is the ONLY clue that they have an underlying health issue). It's not his fault that he is ill, he didn't ask for this, what would your family do if you fell ill, put you to sleep too? Try to find him another home before taking his life. Your family doesn't have the power to create a living animal, and they don't have the right to take a living animals life away because they lack the humanity to take care of him or the common decency to re-home him. Good luck to you (actually moreso to the poor cat), don't get sick or you might get put down too!"},{"prompt":"Can you tame an older feral cat?","completion":"Based on the experiences of friends who've taken in older feral cats, you will first of all, after bringing them home, expect them to hide under your furniture for a very long time - maybe months - only coming out at night to eat and use the litter box, while you're sleeping. If you're patient, and spend a lot of time lying on the floor, and leaving treats near you, you might eventually get them to the point where they will stay out from under the furniture while you are awake, and even come close enough to you to pick up the treats that you've left on the floor. They may or may not ever warm up to you enough to allow you to touch them, though. Furthermore, if the cat is a male, you need to be aware that you would never be able to break that cat of marking his territory, spraying all your furniture, and the corners of walls. Even neutered male feral cats quite likely will not have been neutered young enough to keep them from developing that habit. Cats have not been domesticated for as long, or as thoroughly as dogs, and so their wildness is often much closer to the surface. There are groups, such as Alley Cat Allies, who feed feral cats, and take care of getting them spayed or neutered. There's a very strong reason why these groups don't make efforts to get feral cats put into homes - it's very difficult to domesticate a feral cat - often impossible. Sometimes people we'll have better luck with a feral cat if they already have are cat or cats who are domesticated and comfortable in their environments, (but the spraying thing with male cats would still apply - Maybe more so, since they would be sharing territory with another animal of the same species). If you want to give a home to an unwanted cat, you will do better to go to a shelter and adopt one, if your intention is that they be the only cat."},{"prompt":"it unethical to tell an Alzheimer’s patient that they’re vacationing in an awesome place, rather than telling them they’re in a care facility—assuming they would take your word for it, feel happy, and not discover the lie?","completion":"There is a name for this: it’s called “gaslighting”.

Due to their small size and irregular shape, Phobos and Deimos are thought to be asteroids that were captured into orbit by Mars’s gravity. Deimos is the most distant of the two moons orbiting at a distance of around 14,580 miles/23,458 kilometres and is slowly moving further away from the planet. Phobos orbits much closer to Mars at a distance of around 3,700 miles/6,000 kilometres and is moving closer to the planet with each orbit. Within the next 10 to 50 million years, Phobos is expected to either crash into Mars or break up into a planetary ring that will encircle the planet. Phobos and Diemos were first discovered by American astronomer Asaph Hall in August of 1877. Terraforming Mars. Mars is currently an inhospitable planet for human colonization due to the low gravity, radiation, freezing temperature and lack of a breathable atmosphere. However, it is possible that one day we can terraform Mars to make the planet a better place for humans to live. One idea is to place giant mirrors into orbit around Mars to reflect sunlight and melt the ice caps of Mars’s polar regions. This could cause an atmospheric greenhouse effect which would increase the planets temperature and the level of oxygen in Mars's atmosphere. Eventually, the conditions could become similar enough to Earth that humans could survive without a spacesuit. Terraforming Mars would give humans a second planet to live on and allow us to avoid extinction if something happened to planet Earth. The highest mountain on Mars. Olympus Mons is the highest mountain on Mars and rises to an altitude of around 13.6 miles/22 kilometres above the surface of Mars. This makes Olympus Mons about 2.5 times higher than Mount Everest which is the highest mountain on Earth at a height of 8850 meters/29,035ft. Olympus Mons is the second highest mountain in the solar system after the central peak of Rheasilvia crater on the asteroid Vesta. Olympus Mons covers a surface area of around 374 miles/624 kilometres which makes it similar in size to the state of Arizona and the summit caldera measures around 80 miles/50 kilometers in diameter. Olympus Mons is believed to have gotten so big due to Mars’s lower gravity, lack of active plate tectonics and past volcanic activity. Is there life on Mars? It is speculated that alien life does exist on Mars or that it might have existed at some point in the planets history. Mars is believed to have once had a thick atmosphere and large oceans of water on its surface. However, Mars was slowly stripped of this atmosphere by the solar winds which also caused the Martian oceans to evaporate. The oceans might have existed for long enough to allow simple life to evolve. A Martian meteor called Allan Hills 84001 was discovered in Antarctica on December 27th 1984 and contained possible fossils of microbial life. Spacecrafts sent to study Mars are also sterilized to reduce the risk of contaminating Mars with life from Earth and potentially harming any life on Mars. Despite all of this, there is still no solid evidence to prove that life ever existed on Mars. Allan Hills 84001 Martian meteor.

KEY: apg = assists per game Nikola Jokic is currently averaging 10 assists per game in 2022-23. That’s uncharted territory for a center. Jokic has the highest career apg (6.6) for an NBA center.Wilt Chamberlain is the only center to lead the league in total assists and he had seasons with 8.6, 7.8, 5.2 and 5.0 assists per game. Together, Chamberlain and Jokic have all seven of the best assists per game seasons by NBA centers, and they have four each of the top 25 such seasons. Chamberlain has the second-highest career apg (4.4) for an NBA center, and that is deceptively low because in his prime Wilt averaged close to 40 points per game and was by far the most dominant scorer in NBA history.

The \\"Rough Raiders\\" are a Fleet Replacement Squadron flying the F-35C Lightning II . History [ edit ] A VFA-125 F-35C Lightning II flying over San Francisco Bay during Fleet Week SF 2022 There have been three distinct squadrons known as the Rough Raiders . The first VA-125 was established in 1946 as Naval Reserve Squadron VA-923. It was activated for service in the Korean War on 20 July 1950, redesignated VA-125 in February 1953 and was disestablished on 10 April 1958. The second VA-125 was established on 30 June 1956 as VA-26 and redesignated VA-125 Rough Raiders on 11 April 1958, one day after the first VA-125 disestablished. That second VA-125 was disestablished on 1 October 1977. The VFA-125 \\"Rough Raiders\\" were established on 13 November 1980 at NAS Lemoore , California, becoming the Navy's first F/A-18 squadron. Often, a new squadron will assume the nickname, insignia, and traditions of earlier squadrons, but officially, the US Navy does not recognize a direct lineage with disestablished squadrons if a new squadron is formed with the same designation. [1] VFA-125 received its first aircraft in April 1981, and by March 1985, had amassed over 30,000 mishap-free flight hours in the Hornet. On 1 October 2010, VFA-125 was deactivated as an F/A-18 Fleet Replacement Squadron, and its aircraft and personnel were incorporated into VFA-122 . Mission [ edit ] The \\"Rough Raiders\\" trained F/A-18 pilots for the U.S. Navy, pilots and naval flight officers for the U.S. Marine Corps , and pilots and weapon systems officers for various NATO and Allied nations. Flight training was supplemented by the latest state-of-the-art computer flight simulators and computer-based academic instruction to enhance understanding and performance in the Hornet. In addition, the squadron routinely conducted strike and fighter detachments to NAS Key West , Florida; NAF El Centro , California; and NAS Fallon , Nevada, as well as aboard aircraft carriers in both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Every 6 weeks, a class of between 8 and 12 newly winged USN and USMC naval aviators began the 9-month training course in which they learned the basics of air-to-air andhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VFA-125] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VFA-125]FFA is Volare, Fighter, Attack.

The squadron, known as the \\"Black Knights\\", is based at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar , California and falls under the command of Marine Aircraft Group 11 (MAG-11) and the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing (3d MAW), but deploys with the US Navy 's Carrier Air Wing Nine (NG).

Marine Fighting Squadron 314 ( VMF-314 ) was commissioned on October 1, 1943 at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point , North Carolina . [1] The squadron was originally given the nickname of, \\"Bob's Cats\\". [2] The squadron was assigned to Marine Aircraft Group 32 (MAG 32) flying the F4U Corsair and began training immediately for combat in the South Pacific . In February 1944, the squadron, along with VMF-324 , was among the first units aboard Marine Corps Auxiliary Air Field Kinston . [3] They left MCAAF Kinston for the Pacific theater and arrived at Marine Corps Air Station Ewa on June 18, 1944 and were reassigned to Marine Aircraft Group 23 , 3rd MAW. [4] From there they deployed to Midway Atoll . VMF-314 returned to MCAS Ewa in December 1944 and remained there until April 1945, when they moved to Ie Shima in May 1945 to take part in the Battle of Okinawa [4] as part of Marine Aircraft Group 22 (MAG-22). [5] During the ensuing campaign, VMF-314 pilots were credited with 11 kills [6] and the squadron was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation . [7] After the surrender of Japan , VMF-314 moved to Kyūshū , Japan as part of the occupation force. VMF-314 returned to Marine Corps Air Station El Toro in November 1945 and in March 1946 they arrived back at MCAS Cherry Point. For a short time they were reassigned to Marine Aircraft Group 22 (MAG-22), 9th Marine Aircraft Wing but were decommissioned on April 30, 1947. [2] Postwar years [ edit ] VMF-314 was recommissioned in 1952 at MCAS Miami , Florida and was assigned to Marine Aircraft Group 31 (MAG-31), 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing flying the latest version of the Corsair. That same year, the squadron transitioned to the new F9F Panther . The next three years saw VMF-314 deployed twice, first to Roosevelt Roads , Puerto Rico , and then to Naval Air Facility Atsugi , Japan for an 18-month tour. VMF-314 earned the Korean Service Medal for operations conducted between September 11, 1953 and July 27, 1954.

Or a fixed wing attack squadron piloted by Marines. As an aside, lighter than air are “Z” for a reason I don’t know: [LINKED_TEXT: US Navy airships during World War II - WikipediaThe United States Navy proposed to the U.S. Congress the development of a lighter-than-air station program for anti-submarine patrolling of the coast and harbors. This program proposed, in addition to the expansion at Naval Air Station and Lakehurst, the construction of new stations. The original contract was for steel hangars, 960 ft (290 m) long, 328 ft (100 m) wide and 190 ft (58 m) high, helium storage and service, barracks for 228 men, a power plant, landing mat, and a mobile mooring mast . The Second Deficiency Appropriation Bill for 1941 passed in July 1941, changing the authorization to the construction of eight facilities to accommodate a total of 48 airships (as requested in 1940). Some of these new hangars were built at Lakehurst, Moffett, Weymouth and Weeksville; bases which already had metal hangars. Airship Force expansion [ edit ] At the time of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 which brought the United States into World War II , the US had 10 nonrigid airships: Combat & Patrol Ships Training Ships The TC and K class blimps were quickly pressed into service against Japanese and German submarines which were then sinking American shipping within visual range of the American coast. On 2 January 1942 the US Navy formed the ZP-12 patrol unit based in Lakehurst from the four K airships. A month later, the ZP-32 patrol unit was formed at Naval Air Station Moffett Field in Sunnyvale, California from two TC and two L airships. An airship training base was also created at Moffett Field. The US Navy command, remembering the airship anti-submarine success from World War I, immediately requested new modern anti-submarine airships. Plans for standardized wooden hangars were drawn up by the Navy Department Bureau of Yards and Docks with Arsham Amirikian acting as principal engineer. These were 1,075 ft (328 m) long, 297 ft (91 m) wide and 171 ft (52 m) high. Seventeen of these wooden hangars were completed by the Navy Department Bureau of Yards and Docks in 1943. Airship production [ edit ] Airships were produced by the Goodyear factory in Akron, Ohio and also assembled at Moffett Field in California. From 1942 until 1945, 154 airships were built for the U.S. Navy As well as planned and new construction, some of Goodyear's civilian airships were turned over to the Navy: the Resolute , Enterprise , Reliance , Rainbow , and Ranger becoming L-4 through to L-8. In some cases the airships began observation patrols before being officially commissioned and the crews being sworn in, leading them to be described as \\"privateers\\" in some media. [1] Personnel [ edit ] From 1942–1944, airship military personnel grew from 430 to 12,400 and approximately 1,400 airship pilots and 3,000 support crew were formally trained in the military airship crew training programs. Fleet Airship wings (FASW) [ edit ] Fleet Airship Wings were first created as Airship Patrol Groups (APG) beginning in January of 1942.

Helicopters are easier, H: [LINKED_TEXT: HSM-41 - WikipediaFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Military unit Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron 41 (HSM-41) Seahawks is a United States Navy helicopter squadron based at NAS North Island , San Diego, California . History [ edit ] Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron 41 (HSM 41) is the Navy's Fleet Replacement Squadron dedicated to training new MH-60R pilots and aircrew. When commissioned on 21 January 1983, as Helicopter Anti-Submarine Light 41 (HSL-41) it was the Navy's first Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System (LAMPS) MK III squadron and flew the Sikorsky SH-60B helicopter. HSL-41 trained pilots and aircrew for the west coast HSL squadrons in San Diego, Hawaii, and Japan. The success of West Coast LAMPS detachments in the Pacific Ocean , Indian Ocean , and Persian Gulf is a tribute to the quality of initial and follow-on training that has been the hallmark of HSM 41. As a result, the squadron was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation in 1985, 1988, 1991 and 2002. On 8 December 2006, HSL-41 was re designated from Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron Light 41 to Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron 41. In February 2008, HSM 41 surpassed 140,000 flight hours without a major aircraft incident and celebrated its 25th anniversary. Since 1983, HSM 41 has trained over 3,000 Fleet Replacement Pilots and Aircrew for service in LAMPS MK III and MH-60R fleet squadrons. In 2020, the squadron reached 230,000 flight hours without a major incident. [1] On 14 March 2013, a helicopter belonging to the squadron made an emergency landing in Chula Vista .

[LINKED_TEXT: List of United States Navy aircraft squadrons - WikipediaThis is a list of active United States Navy aircraft squadrons . Deactivated or disestablished squadrons are listed in the List of inactive United States Navy aircraft squadrons . Navy aircraft squadrons are composed of several aircraft (from as few as about four to as many as about a dozen), the officers who fly them, the officers and sailors who maintain them and administrative support officers and sailors. Some of the units listed in this article are not designated as \\"squadrons\\", but they all operate U.S. Navy aircraft in some capacity. Squadrons and their history are listed in the Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons (DANAS). Squadron organization [ edit ] Navy squadron organizational chart. (Click the diagram to enlarge it) Active duty squadrons are commanded by a commanding officer (CO) who holds the rank of commander . Second in command is the executive officer (XO), who also holds the rank of commander. The XO typically assumes command of the squadron after approximately 15 months. There are typically four functional departments – Operations, Maintenance, Safety/NATOPS, and Administration – each led by a lieutenant commander functioning as the department head. Within the departments are divisions (each typically headed by a lieutenant ) and branches (headed by a lieutenant, junior grade or a chief petty officer ). The CO of a Reserve squadron is also a commander, as is the XO who will also assume command after approximately 15 months. However, reserve squadron demographics are typically older and more senior in rank than their active duty squadron counterparts. Department heads in reserve squadrons are typically senior lieutenant commanders, although some may be recently promoted commanders. Where this difference in maturity level becomes more apparent is at the division officer level. Since most officers in reserve squadrons previously served on active duty in the Regular Navy in a flying status for eight to ten or more years, they are typically already lieutenant commanders, or achieve that rank shortly after transferring to the Navy Reserve. As a result, lieutenants are a minority and lieutenants, junior grade, are practically non-existent in reserve squadrons. As a result, divisions are typically headed by lieutenant commanders and branches by lieutenants, senior chief petty officers or chief petty officers. Types of squadrons [ edit ] Squadrons can be categorized in a number of ways: Active versus Navy Reserve, land-based versus sea-based, fixed wing versus rotary wing (helicopter) versus Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and by mission. Unlike the USAF, US Army, and USMC, the US Navy does not refer to organizations such as maintenance (though US Navy aircraft squadrons do include their own organic maintenance departments), medical, administrative or other units as \\"squadrons\\". In the US Navy a squadron is a unit of aircraft, ships, submarines or boats. There are two exceptions: Tactical Air Control Squadrons (TACRON) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Navy_aircraft_squadrons] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Navy_aircraft_squadrons]Oh well."},{"prompt":"What are some first date tips?","completion":"Here are some tips to keep in mind for a successful first date: 1.

What I also like about Timely is that it has integration with a ton of useful tools for creatives and can capture every second I work in Photoshop, Sketch, etc."},{"prompt":"w do I talk like a native English speaker?","completion":"As an adult learner (that includes teens learning the language), you may have an accent on individual sounds. BUT, what people actually listen to when judging how “native” a person sounds is their suprasegmentals. That’s a fancy word for the tune of an entire sentence or series of sentences. It’s the melody, what you stress and what you don’t stress. Generally, new information or information that is meant to contrast goes at the end of a sentence (once grammar has been satisfied). Those kinds of words or phrases get more stress in the sentence. It’s not possible to really describe this in text on the Quora, but if you spend some time listening to not just the letter R, but the whole sentence, the whole melody of a line of dialogue, you may learn something important. When does the tone go up? When does it go down? What kind of words are spoken louder or longer? Which ones are “swallowed” and quiet? That sort of thing. Teachers rarely spend time on this, and yet it is in some ways more important than simply learning to say one single sound perfectly. Source: a master’s degree in teaching English as a second language; I had to take an entire graduate course on this exact topic, and we evaluated incoming students’ English abilities based in part on this. If you can find any materials by Dr. Wayne B. Dickerson on pronunciation, I recommend them."},{"prompt":"Which scene do you think shows Darth Vader at his most terrifying, his rampage in Rogue One or the scene in Episode Three of the ObiWan Kenobi miniseries?","completion":"I think it was during his encounter with Luke in Episode 5, where he was huge and glowering, not doing the “Bruce Lee” Bugs bunny thing."},{"prompt":"x^{2}+y^{2}=2","completion":"X=1 and y=3"},{"prompt":"Are there waves of air on top of our atmosphere like waves of water on the surface of the ocean?","completion":"The atmosphere supports several kinds of waves. The ones most like ocean waves are gravity waves. They are propagating up and down waves of the atmosphere that also show up as variations in atmospheric pressure. They can be caused by flow over mountains, storms, and other things. Other kinds of waves include sound waves, Rossby waves, and Kelvin-Helmholtz waves to mention a few."},{"prompt":"What is the cheapest city in San Francisco Bay Area?","completion":"Alviso"},{"prompt":"What is the most horrible thing you have seen while in a mental hospital?","completion":"Myself, fighting violently against the restraints, seven or eight people trying to tie me down, blood everywhere, a staff member accidentally getting wounded in the chaos, attempting to sedate me while I screamed for death. No, that’s probably not the worst thing I’ve seen. It’s from the most recent hospitalization, and I don’t remember the previous ones very well anymore. But I do know a lot of shit definitely went down those hospitalizations too… people freak out in there, often, and it can be terrifying."},{"prompt":"Was Arnab Goswami more deserving than Ravish Kumar for the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 2019? Why or why not?","completion":"Personally I don't like ether Mr Goswami or Mr Kumar. I find Mr Goswami is too much hot tempered and argumentative. As if he wants to win a debate by his lung power and often not a neutral moderator but tries to impose his own views. Debate leads to verbal road side fights and I stop the channel. I will advise him to win a debate by logic and not by his lung power and ask debaters to follow this rule. I am not questioning his intelligence but debates should not lead to verbal fights and violate noise pollution rules. Regarding Mr Kumar, I find him to be of negative mentality. Unlike Mr Goswami, he is calm and quite but very much opinionated. He is clearly biased against BJP and pseudo-secular. He portrays single incidences as national characters. He becomes the judge himself. He supports western media."},{"prompt":"What do gun fanatics have to say about the fact that there are over 130 studies proving that gun control works?

However, if you could give me one piece of advice, what would it be?","completion":"Get a lawyer. Failing that - don’t try and be smart - stick to the facts with no embellishment, exaggeration or editorialising. Answer any questions you are asked directly and succinctly and if the judge says something like ‘ I don’t need to hear from you further’ or ‘ I have all I need’ or similar shut up. Don’t say things like ‘ I’m telling the truth but he’s lying’ - that is for the court to decide. Lastly make sure that anything you say in court is relevant - don’t waste time - and if the other side want to negotiate or settle before going into court listen to them carefully especially if they are represented."},{"prompt":"Why are Siberian Huskies abandoned in large quantities?","completion":"Because people do not do any research on owning a Huskie. They require lots of attention, excercise etc. They are not an average dog like a lab for example. They are working dogs and need to be kept stimulated. People get them and then realise it is hard work and do not want to put in the effort."},{"prompt":"What are the benefits of recumbent exercise bikes?","completion":"The main advantage to using a [LINKED_TEXT: recumbent exercise bike] [URL: http://www.recumbentblog.com/recumbent-bike-reviews/] is the seated position. Your spine and shoulders are in a fairly neutral position as opposed to an upright exercise bike where you have to lean forward and put a lot of weight on your arms and shoulders. Recumbent bikes are great for senior or someone who has some form of minor injury to the upper body."},{"prompt":"For prochoice folks: If a man's wife or partner learns that she is pregnant and wants an abortion, should the father get a say in the decision if he wants to support and be there for the child?","completion":"There’s hoping that the man and the wife have the kind of relationship in which they take life-altering decisions together. Because otherwise they don’t have all that much of a functional marriage. That said, the final decision must be hers. What will happen to the child if it is born, what kind of life the two of them can provide, that’s the mutual part. But only she can know whether she is up to the task of building another human out of her own body and then going through childbirth and recovery. She will pay a price for that child that is yet unknown, but the one thing that is for sure is that there will be a price. Almost certainly not the highest one, but some, and she will pay it alone. I also know somebody who ended up with fewer children than her husband would have wished for because she strongly felt her next child wouldn’t be healthy, and that was the end of it. I know that there was a time, after three pregnancies in fairly close succession, that I was similarly sure I can’t, just physically can’t, do it again. That it would ruin me and the baby would be premature at best. No matter whether you trust the woman’s sense of her own body, or you consider it silly emotion, you can’t really argue against that. What the husband is free to do is decide he cannot live with a woman who would abort his child, especially if he made his stance known long before it became relevant. People divorce for lesser reasons, sometimes."},{"prompt":"Do you trust the FBI, given events since the firing of Comey?","completion":"I have not trusted the FBI since around 1995. I caught them fabricating charges against an individual who stole a grenade simulator. They claimed the individual had modified the device to make it more powerful. They disposed of the device on my range. I inspected the device and determined that it had not been modified. The agents had taped material to it and it looked like it was modified but in fact the device was a dud and inert."},{"prompt":"Man of Steel, if Superman was strong enough to snap Zod’s neck, couldn’t he have just prevented him from moving his head?","completion":"Forever?

Have you been to one, and was the racism noticable?","completion":"Yes, i’ve had the misfortune of being to one. To preface this- Sunset towns are very rare. They just simply aren’t much of a thing in 2018, so don’t be getting paranoid thinking you’ll stumble into one during a road trip, or that you need to consider them at all when travelling. However, I was one of the people unlucky enough to stumble upon one. I can go from looking olive or very light skinned like some Italians or Spaniards in the winter, to looking medium/dark brown in the summer. When I tan, I tan. So, my summer-tanned self was staying in Ohio on vacation. I have lots of cool family up there, and it’s like a whole other planet than Texas. Lots of different trees, grasses, insects, people, everything. Normally i’d stay in the suburb my relatives all live in, but we’d go to a more rural area to visit one of my distant relatives farm. Even the suburb I had visited felt like it was a window to the 80’s, and very old-fashioned. The buildings, cars, music, attitude, etc etc. Immediately, you could just tell people were staring at you. When eating out, walking around, or doing anything for that matter. You felt like you were constantly watched, surrounded by eyes and glares. Also, people were usually very friendly. You’d wave, say hello, and be friendly toward strangers. But the general vibe i’d get when talking to people was a mix of “I’m uncomfortorable and scared of you” to “Why are you talking to me, just go away.” Most responses I got were very short, concise, and to the point. It’s hard to describe the feeling, but it’s very creepy and something I wouldn’t want to experience again. What really opened my eyes was two experiences at two different gas stations. I walked into the gas station with 4 in 1’s, and I was allowed to buy whatever I wanted. I’d hated roadtrips, but doing this was one of the things I enjoyed the most. It gave me a sense of freedom in a way, being a young teen that has my own money and a whole store of options to choose from. As soon as I started walking around, i’d instantly heard the two clerks talk to eachother. They had been having a conversation as soon as I walked in, but after a while the topic swtiched to me. It’s all fuzzy in my memory, but I remember the gist of their conversation. Clerk 1: Yeah he got money, but it’s in singles. (I think he was referring to me carrying 1 dollar bills) Clerk 2: He’s probably one of them boys from (random town name I forgot) Clerk 1: Why do you reckon he’s on this side of town then? They know not to come over here. Clerk 2: Beats me. Just better buy what he wants and get out soon. I overheard their conversation clearly. They didn’t sound like they intended me to hear them, but I did. I wasn’t that ignorant even as a younger teen, so I quickly bought what I wanted and left. I thought to myself after that for a while. I’d decided that it would be best to bring a 5 or higher to the next gas station so I wouldn’t get judged. So, a couple days later, I walked down to a gas station from where we were staying. In my weird teenage mind, I decided the higher bill I brought, the less-judged I would get. Accordingly, I asked my dad for a 20, told him I wouldn’t spend more than 5 and would give him the change. I walked into this next store with my 20 in hand. This time, there was also two clerks, but one male one female. Again, they started to talk about me almost right after I walked in. In this station there was a decent amount of people, but I still managed to hear them. Male: You seen him before? Female: No. Male: Bet he’s from (same town name other clerk mentioned) Female: Where’d you think he got the 20 from? Male: Might’a stole it. Female: Should we call the sheriff? Male: Nah. He ain’ look that old. I’ll keep an eye on ‘eem though. This time I was both a mix of angry and confused. My first thought was “They’re still judging me even though I brought in my 20? How dare they.” And after I thought out the whole situation, I just got confused. Only in hindsight I could realize that they were flat out racists, and completely stereotyping me. To them, if I had a small amount of money, I must of been poor and ghetto. And if I had a lot of money, I must have stolen it."},{"prompt":"What are the musthave iPhone apps?

It's more of a problem solving game because the problem is faster and more efficient and classic. The more you practice, the better you'll get at it. It is globally recognized as a mind sport and every year a large number of contests and competitions are organized around the world to promote it along with various prizes, interview opportunities with big companies, awards etc. If that's not lucrative enough, just so you know there are coders out there who only enter these contests as a job. In recent times, competitive programming has gained immense popularity due to its uniqueness and the gradual popularity has welcomed a large number of organizations along with participants to engage in this sport. Many startups and companies have also started having rounds of interviews based on the selection of candidates from these competitive coding contests. Concurrent programming enables and enhances the programmer's ability to solve problems. Organizations look for candidates who have excellent problem solving skills because languages, frameworks, technologies can be learned at any time, but the concept or logic of complex solutions depends on problem solving thinking skills. So while it is not necessary to do competitive programming, it helps in building problem solving skills. Be careful, you should only pursue it because you like or are passionate about coding, otherwise most of the time people will lose interest and quit midway without making much progress. Try it personally without losing patience for some time, I feel most of you would love it."},{"prompt":"What is absolutely the best Indian restaurant in the world, and why?","completion":"Charminar Xpress is a renowned [LINKED_TEXT: Indian restaurant in downtown Austin] [URL: https://charminarxpress.com/contact-us/] that offers a unique and diverse culinary experience.

Diagnostic x-rays, including mammograms, are the main source of radiation exposure beyond naturally occurring radiation, like cosmic rays. Mammograms deliver less radiation exposure than does almost any other diagnostic radiologic procedure. The table below shows the radiation exposure to various organs due to multiple types of diagnostic x-ray procedures (in mGy). A single screen mammogram delivers the same radiation dose to the breast as a flight attendant might get annually during normal work hours. It is a very small amount. The benefits of finding breast cancer early far outweigh the extremely small risk of cancer induction by the almost infinitesimal dose of radiation given during mammography.

Whereas cosmetic dentistry focuses on the esthetic needs as well as the functioning and the harmony. Following are the types of cosmetic dentistry by which a teeth can be restored to esthetics: Veneers: Teeth cutting is done for the entire surfaces of the teeth and a veneer is fabricated for the teeth and it envelopes entire of the teeth surface and it’s a very esthetic option thereby enhancing smile.Implants: In edentulous areas implants are good option provided there is enough bony support to accommodate it.Laminates: Here only facial surfaces of the teeth to be restored are abraded and after impressions these laminates are fabricated and they thus restore the esthetics of teeth.Crown build ups: Composites matching the teeth’s shade can be selected to build up the teeth surfaces and thus restore esthetics.

Majority of population in India believes in fake doctors or quaks once you are done with your studies you will realise I was fool because people trust these quaks and you will realise they are making more money than you even have more patients than you, it will make you mad. In our country like India even gov do not do any thing to check these quaks because they have unions they have vote bank nowdays they have their own fake certificates.

One restaurant manager at a Hooters asked if I chewed glass in a sideshow on the weekends because I barely broke a sweat eating their hottest wing sauce. To me their hottest sauce is so tame a toddler could handle it. But I was not even close to prepared for what I encountered in North Dakota a handful of years ago. The hottest food I have ever had was at Parrot Cay in Grand Forks, North Dakota. I love hot/spicy food. I like my nose to run while I’m eating, lol. Anyway, this place has a heat scale on their menu that ranges up to 40. I asked for jambalaya and wanted the level 40 just to see how bad it was. The bartender tried to talk me out of it. She kept telling me I didn’t want it, but I insisted that I did. She said there were only a few regular customers that could handle it, and they had worked their way up to it. Again, I insisted. She gave in. I soon regretted not listening to her. The pain was almost instant. I took a couple more bites and suddenly I was overwhelmed. I pushed the bowl away, I was rocking back and forth on my stool, suckin air, and drinkin my beer in between breaths. My eyes were uncontrollably watering, tears streaming down my face. I was almost in a state of panic. The bartender walked by and smiled while shaking her head. “I told you” she said, lol. Apparently the sauce they make is a concoction using ghost peppers, habaneros, Carolina Reapers, and I don’t know what all. But they told me the heat is in the neighborhood of 7 million scoville units. The Carolina Reaper is the current heaveyweight champ with an individual pepper coming in at 2.2 million scoville heat units. (Google research) While I was licking my wounds and suckin down that cold beer, a small group of people across the room started to cheer. I could see a man with his arms raised so I asked what was going on. Apparently they have a wing challenge there with wings basted in that incredibly hot sauce. A guy had just did the challenge.

Naturally things in the sprint should be reasonably achievable in the given time frame… more or less. It helps split a mammoth project into smaller, achievable and actionable items. It used to be a very software development oriented methodology but has now spilled over into other teams. One use case is my own marketing team that uses this methodology. It keeps us all organized. It’s very important that you also have a proper sprint planning platform/tool/software. My team currently uses [LINKED_TEXT: Tara.ai] [URL: http://tara.ai/] - free (for unlimited users), simple and very effortless to integrate within a team. Previous teams I’ve been in have also used Trello and Asana to manage the tasks. I quite like Tara, it’s very simple and straightforward and to be quite frank, not very heavy on the eyes. It can be very easy to get lost in a software that has too many functionalities.

I was hiking, my dogs were at home for the week, as I needed a chance to get away from all responsibility. I came upon an oak tree. the thing was MASSIVE! it must have been six feet (two meters) in diameter at the base! It was rotted, so very dead, but had not been that way long, maybe two or three years. I saw something sticking out of it, it looked like a branch at first, but then I realized it had at some point been polished and smooth, and was now weather worn. I used my hatchet to chip away at the soft wood surrounding it. And found it was Hemlock handled Lumber Axe. I took it to a guy I knew who worked in the Forestry industry for decades and he told me that while it had no cash value, this axe was a priceless historical artifact. The style of the head and the handle’s shape and the oil used to keep it intact, were all things that indicated it was from the 1600s! He asked to see the tree so I showed him (amzing how he kept up really at 89 years old) and he looked at where I had puled the axe from and declared, with the authority of someone who has seen it before, that the axe had become stuck in the tree, and the owner was unable to pull it out. While the portion of the axe that had been exposed to the elements when I found it was weather worn and a bit rough, the rest was preserved perfectly by the tree sap that had poured over the wound, and the object. I donated the axe to the Maine Timber Museum. Most people don't believe me about it because “America was founded in 1776”…let that sink in, these people honestly believe no one lived in America until it became its own country…yeah…"},{"prompt":"w make money with affiliate marketing?","completion":"The best way to start making money online is through affiliate Marketing.

Basically, they invest in an entire portfolio of ETFs for you, at whatever risk level you want. They offer the simplest interface and execution, and provide just a little bit of advice about how to invest. The key improvement above investing in Vanguard funds is: No need to make buy/sell decisions. Often times people get tempted to react to market movements (Sell Europe! Buy Small-caps!) when self-investing, and cost themselves about 1.2% a year in foregone gains from market mis-timing. No need to monitor/rebalance - they take care of it for you. Just pick a risk level and go. They automatically reinvest dividends (which can often sit in your brokerage account as cash for a while, doing nothing). This also removes the temptation to withdraw it as cash. It looks like, and acts like a cash account. Want to withdraw 200? No problem. They take care of it, and you don't need to think about selling parts of each ETF. At most brokerages, you'll incur fees for trading. These really add up. For instance, if you rebalance a 100,000 Schwab account with 8 ETFs in it quarterly (good practice), you're getting pretty close to doing all the work Betterment does yourself, and not saving any money at all after brokerage fees."},{"prompt":"w can I download magazines for free on the Internet?","completion":"Project Gutenberg: Project Gutenberg is one of the oldest and largest free book websites.

From a progressive standpoint, you can't force somebody to be Jewish if they really don't want to identify as Jewish. Religion and culture is separate. I believe that if somebody who was raised and born into the Jewish faith converts to a different religion, they are not Jewish by religion but they have Jewish heritage (I see the religion and heritage as separate). I was born with Jewish heritage as my late father was Jewish but I wasn't raised in the Jewish religion. I only started practicing Judaism in my mid twenties and became formally Jewish. I am therefore Jewish by both religion and heritage. My brother identifies as Catholic as his religion but his heritage is Jewish. Nobody can really change their heritage. I will always be British regardless of how un-British I feel and half Polish no matter how un-Polish I feel. The one identity I do feel strongly with is being Jewish. At the end of the day I believe that nobody can or should have the monopoly to tell you who you are. According to some Jews I'm not Jewish because my mother isn't and my conversion wasn't an orthodox one, but I know that I'm Jewish and those who tell me I'm not Jewish don't have the monopoly or right to decide my identity. 3 out of 4 movements view me as Jewish (liberal, reform and masorti) and I count as a Jew on the British census. I am also Jewish enough to make Aliyah. As the traditionalists think that somebody who converts from Judaism to another religion is still Jewish, I don't view a person who converts from Judaism to another religion as Jewish. Once you change your religion, you are the religion that you convert to unless you revert or reconvert back to the previous religion. You can't force somebody to be Jewish if they don't want to be. As far as I'm concerned that person just has Jewish heritage like I mentioned. I met many people on my birthright trip to Israel who had Jewish mothers but didn't identify with or feel Jewish. Barely any of them practice or are involved with Judaism nor care to. Ironically I who has a Jewish father and non-Jewish mother very strongly identify with being Jewish and am actively part of the Jewish community and practice the religion. Taking on the Jewish heritage is not for everyone and instead of focusing on those with maternal Jewish heritage who don't identify with Judaism nor want to be Jewish, focus on those who want to reclaim their Jewishness regardless of whether it's from the paternal or maternal line."},{"prompt":"Which is the best abroad educational consultancy for studying in Germany?","completion":"Hassle-free application for visa, seeking advice and getting assistance from overseas consultants are top priorities which students look for while planning to study abroad.

It's true! These three molecules play vital roles in the functioning of your cells, and they each have their own distinct characteristics that make them special. First, let's talk about DNA. This molecule is made up of two strands of nucleotides that are twisted together in a double helix structure. The nucleotides are joined by covalent bonds, and the order of the nucleotides encodes the genetic information that is passed from one generation to the next. Next up is mRNA, or messenger RNA. This molecule is also made up of nucleotides, but it is typically single stranded rather than double stranded like DNA. mRNA carries the genetic information from the DNA in the nucleus to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm, where it is used to synthesize proteins. Finally, there's tRNA, or transfer RNA. This molecule is much smaller than DNA or mRNA, and it has a unique cloverleaf shape. tRNA plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by bringing the amino acids to the ribosomes and placing them in the correct order according to the instructions encoded in the mRNA. So there you have it! DNA, mRNA, and tRNA may have different structures, but they all work together to keep your cells functioning properly. In fact, all three of these molecules are present within you right now, reading this very text!"},{"prompt":"When, how, why, and by whom was Tamil created according to ancient Tamil literature?","completion":"One day God created everything.

This is a time-demanding problem that need a solution by taking a real action. Well, the free account of google gives us 15 GB storage space, which is fare. But this little storage space is shared with your google drive. After June 2021, this space will be also shared with google photos too! So deleting unnecessary emails from your gmail will not only cleanup your gmail inbox, but also help you to free up some storage space in your google account. Selecting all emails and delete all is not a good thought. One may have received many important emails over years, and deleting all will permanently damage his/her account. So I think, one should categorize first which emails to delete, then take appropriate action. Unsubscribe from those email senders who send you their promotional emails everyday. This will prevent you from getting any email in future from them unless you want. Open an email and carefully look for ‘unsubscribe’ option within email body/heading/bottom, then click it.Select one email sender and delete thousands of emails sent by the particular people/company following a few click. At first find an email sender who has sent you many emails. This can be promotional emails from a company sent automatically to you and thousands of others daily using any of email marketing services. Better, if you select the email sender you have unsubscribed using simple methods shown in my earlier post.

It’s on You Tube somewhere. It’s close to the way I learned back before the internet, but a little better. Second I’m going to say to make sure you strop as a final step. Everybody skips that. Get some Jeweler’s Rouge and chunk of leather, and strop your chisel when you get done sharpening. Third I’m going to say that you need to practice. I haven’t sharpened much lately due to ongoing garage renos and bee equipment builds (no chiseling in those). You know what? My chisels aren’t going to be as sharp as usual when I get back to it. You know why? Because I get sloppy and round off the end of a sharpening stroke. Because I’m out of practice.

Eventually, after a long and mournful journey back to his kingdom they were instructed to bury the head at the White Hill in London facing towards the continent so the dead king could watch for invaders and giving warning and protection. Eventually there came along a king who was almost as powerful and almost as great as Bran and this was Arthur. Arthur ordered the head of the old king to be brought up from beneath the White Hill because Arthur, in his pride, wanted the kingdom to be protected by no might but his. And the reason I say that this is connected to ravens at the Tower is that the White Hill is said to be the place where the Tower was built by William the Conqueror and ‘Bran’ means ‘raven’.

A voice said, “If you’re not careful you could spend of your life in here, and not out there.” Second— at that time philosopher, Joseph Campbell was on PBS talking about “Following your bliss”.

It did not matter what I was actually doing. I thought of the day my little brother, 8, and I sold hats to the visitors at Graceland. I was the one year after Elvis’s death, August 16, 1978. My dad was a small business entrepreneur. He said, “There must be 50,000 fans down there, go sell them something, I’ll watch on TV”. I said OK you’re on. Sam and I sat on the curb and watched the long line across the street. A brilliant woman was selling a single rose for 10. Suddenly, an ambulance arrived. Someone fainted from heat exhaustion. I grabbed Henry by the hand and we drove the Surplus City. We bought every wide-brimmed Mexican style hat for 1.50. Stacked them on Henry’s head and went in the crowd. You had to have a solid 5.00 bill. I held on to your wrist, took the money, put a hat in your hand and let go of your wrist-that how many people were on me for a hat. Now that was FUN! The third event happened while I was getting a Coke at the machine between graduate school classes. A man came up to me and asked me what I was going to do when I graduated. He and I had debated in class. He was an old guy (like I am now). He asked if I would like a job at Schering-Plough in Memphis (Maybelline, Coppertone, and Dr. Scholl’s). Turned out he was Senior VP for Finance and Operations getting his PhD. He said it was for a Brand Manager. I had no idea what that was. I went to the library and looked it up (all paper then). It was a bolt of lightning. I could solve problems for millions of people across the nation. I could also work with chemists, lawyers, engineers, sales people, and artists.

His mother, Olympias, was an Epirote. His father was Philip II, king of Macedonia. While the palace spoke used Attic, the refined Greek of the era, the majority of the Macedonian farmers and herders spoke only the Macefonian dialect. Epirotes and Macedonians spoke the same dialect. Makedonizein, speaking in the Macedonian dialect, had it parallels in Laconizein, speaking the Laconian (Spartan) dialect, or Attikizein, speaking the Attic dialect of Athens. We know that Alexander spoke two Greek dialects Attic (Athenian) and Northwest Greek (Macedonian), and since his favorite poets were Homer and Pindar, we know that he was fluent reading Homeric (Ionian) Greek and Doric Greek (spoken in Sparta, Crete, Corinth, Thebes, closely related to his own Macedonian). The Macedonian dialect known to us now as Northwest Greek, was spoken by the Macedonians, the Epirotes, and everyone in western Greece, west of the Pindus range, down to Aetolia. It was also spoken in Olympia in Elis, in west-central Peloponnese, home of the Olympic games and in the area around Delphi, at Locri, in western central Greece. Northwest Greek is closely related to Doric Greek, as noted above. Ancient Macedonian has ABSOLUTELY NO CONNECTION to the language standardized by Yugoslav linguists in 1945 for usage in the newly formed Yugosla Autonomous People's Republic of Makedonija (Southern Serbia/Vardarska). The Slavomacedonian language was put together using west Bulgarian dialects of the Monastir area and it was infused with Serbian literary and scientific terminology, to create a practical, standardised, modern language out of the Slavonic dialects of the area. Modern Македонски(Makedonski) (the language of the Yugoslav SlavoMacedonians), I stress again, is a South Slavic language closely related to Bulgarian and Serbian, being their intermediary, and interinteligible, has ABSOLUTELY NO CONNECTION WITH THE Greek dialect of the Macedonians. Attic Greek, infused with the Macedonian dialect was the language which Alexander the Great spread throughout the East. Its development, the fussion of Macefonian and Attic created Coene Greek.

DP was formed in 1967 with Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord, Ian Paice, Rod Evans, and Nick Simper. The did three decent albums, a combination of bluesy stuff, covers, instrumentals, and on their third album ventured into prog with the song April. Blackmore and Lord decided they wanted to go “harder”, and after hearing the group Episode Six, canned Evans and Simper, replacing them with Ian Gillan and Roger Glover. This classic “Mark II” lineup is what most people think of as DP, but before releasing the extremely heavy “Deep Purple In Rock” they recorded a couple of rock orchestral pieces of Lord’s, “Concerto For Group And Orchestra” and “Gemini Suite”. Mark II recorded 4 studio albums (In Rock, Fireball, Machine Head, Who Do We Think We Are) and released the amazing live album “Made In Japan”. Behind the scenes, however, Blackmore and Gillan did not get along, and Gillan quit in frustration. Glover soon left, figuring he was going to get fired. They were replaced by unknown vocalist David Coverdale, and Glen Hughes on bass and secondary vocals. The Mark III lineup did two studio albums, “Burn” and “Stormbringer” and released the live album “Made In Europe”. Then Blackmore got fed up and quit, and was replaced with guitarist Tommy Bolin. This Mark IV lineup put out one album, “Come Taste The Band”, but touring was to be very spotty as Bolin fell deeply into his heroin problems, while Hughes was struggling with cocaine. Since DP was really known as a live band, this was a huge problem and the band broke up in 1975. In 1984, the Mark II lineup got back together and released the classic “Perfect Strangers”. They would release a second studio album, “The House Of Blue Lights” and a live album “Nobody’s Perfect”. Then, Gillan got fed up with Blackmore again and quit, being replace by former Rainbow vocalist Joe Lynn Turner. They release a studio album “Slaves And Masters” and were supposed to release a second album, but the studio didn’t like Turner (thought he made the band sound like Rainbow instead of DP) and brought Gillan back to record “The Battle Rages On” (Gillan rerecorded the already recorded Turner vocals.). This pissed ofd Blackmore, and he left mid-tour and was replace on the tour with Joe Santriani (Mark VI), but Santriani only played the tour. He was then replaced with former Dixie Dregs and Kansas guitarist Steve Morse, and the group was stable until Lord decided it was time to retire (he was in his seventies and beginning to have health problems). Don Airey took over for Lord, and this (Mark VIII) is the current lineup. Also, during the late seventies, Rod Evans formed a group and began touring under the Deep Purple name without permission. This led to a lawsuit, and Evans no longer receives any royalties from the three albums that he did. Anyway, once Blackmore left for good, the band has been very stable, only changing because Jon Lord retired.

They have much more in common with the Ptolemies.","completion":"I would disagree with the premise that the Targaryens have no Wars of the Roses equivalent. While it may be reasonably argued that on a macro level — the broadest possible plot of “family fights another family” — the Starks and the Lannisters seem like the Yorks and the Lancasters (the names are also similar), I think that on a micro level — that is to say, looking at actual individual people, historical context and how the moving parts of the story fit together in a more granular sense — the Baratheons better resemble the Yorks and the Targaryens better resemble the Lancasters. The Yorks and the Lancasters were factions of warring cousins, as are the Baratheons and the Targaryens. They shared a common ancestor in Edward III, like Aegon V in our story (if you want to be technical, they were also related through Edward’s sons). The mental fitness of the Lancastrian king and the ill treatment of his nobles broadly parallels Aerys II’s insanity (though Henry VI was never violent). In terms of the Targaryen/Lancaster rivals, Robert, Stannis and Renly are very nearly dead ringers for Edward IV, Richard III and George. You also have three Targaryen/Lancaster potential heirs in the wings with their own various Henry VII parallels: Dany, Jon and fake Aegon (whose possible Blackfyre lineage ties him even closer to Henry VII with the Beaufort parallel; he even has a ginger guardian a la Jasper Tudor, which is as unsubtle a wink to history as you’re likely to find in the story). It’s also the case that various Targaryens in history mirror their English counterparts: Aegon I and William I, Maegor the Cruel/Aegon IV and Henry VIII (though Henry was post-WotR), Daeron I and Richard I, Aegon II and Stephen, and Rhaenyra and Matilda, just to name the more obvious ones. It seems strange to bake these parallels into the story but to then completely divorce their descendants from the modern Targaryens’ machinations, which is the premise this question is based on.

They work their asses of to achieve this. Talent and hard work are valued more than nepotism and sycophancy. Ideas are stronger than individuals.

That has created a number of knock on changes, but one of those has been a small but steady annual decrease in the numbers of people watching sports and other live broadcast events. It really isn’t just the NFL."},{"prompt":"Why does Google have such a complex labeling system for variables and software classes?","completion":"Ha! Great question. The defining reason for this is that they would rather not lose their minds. When you reach Google scale, there are millions of libraries/tools each of which can easily run into the thousands lines of code. Standards need to be extremely structured because if they weren't there would be things no one understands. Standards have to grow in complexity proportionally to how large the codebase is.

And seem to think they are cats and dogs. The uncertainty principle is describing how the fundaments of nature are neither particles nor waves. This means position and velocity can never, by definition, be known, as these fundaments (or quanta) are described in what we call wave functions - or via intervals if you prefer — not bits. However, your question goes into something else. It seems to go into the famous observer effect, which was ridiculed (erroneously) by Schrodinger and his ”Cat.” And this famous thought example just tries to discuss the absurdity of what the observer effect might imply on a macro level. Anyway, Heisenberg is correct. Nothing to defeat. Schrodinger's Cat was incorrect, and your question makes no sense, as it misunderstands what both these exceptional men were really talking about.

When alternatives like React and Vue offered the same benefits as AngularJS with better performance, the Angular team decided to completely rewrite the framework. How Polkastarter Works Each subsequent version of Angular (4, 5, 6, 7, 8) is mostly non-breaking incremental changes. For these reasons, \\"Angular\\" now refers to Angular 2+, while \\"AngularJS\\" refers to the original version. Main difference Following are the main differences between Angular 2+ and AngularJS: Typescript Angular is rewritten to use TypeScript. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. It compiles to regular vanilla JavaScript but provides syntax for type checking, annotations and ES6 based extensions. Since TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, it needs to be compiled or \\"transpiled\\" to ES5 JavaScript so your code still runs in the browser. This requires the use of NodeJS and other build tools to preprocess TypeScript files. While it is possible to use Angular 2+ without TypeScript, the industry standard is to adopt TypeScript because it performs better in the Angular ecosystem. MVC and Component Architecture Model, View, Controller (MVC) is a software design paradigm that is used by AngularJS. Controllers are defined with the scope variable, which represents the underlying data model. This data model can be updated in views and controllers. The view is an HTML file that both displays and dynamically updates the scope variable. Angular 2+ uses a more component based architecture. Separate functional parts are defined in components. These components are organised in a hierarchy and make use of their own templates and stylesheets. Dependency Injection (DI) Both AngularJS and Angular use dependency injection. DI allows you to share common functionality between different controllers or components. In AngularJS, dependencies are injected into controller functions, link functions, and directive definitions. In Angular, constructors, providers and declarations are used to manage these dependencies. Angular CLI Angular 2+ features the Angular CLI: a command-line interface for quickly generating Angular components, services, directives, and more. It comes with handy commands for building Angular projects (compiling TypeScript files and other assets into vanilla js files that run in the browser). It also makes it easier for you to build projects for different environments and allows for linting, type checking, etc. AngularJS doesn't have its own CLI. Performance Angular is much faster than AngularJS. In fact, Angular is said to be over 5 times faster depending on your application design. Popularity AngularJS was very popular before React and Vue came along. It provides an elegant solution for JavaScript SPA through two-way data binding and MVC architecture. The ability to dynamically update JavaScript POJOs from HTML templates has attracted a lot of attention. As a result, alternatives like React and Vue emerged with superior diff algorithms that eclipsed AngularJS. With the release of Angular 2 (2016), Angular fought back. Today, Angular remains one of the most popular [LINKED_TEXT: UI development frameworks] [URL: https://www.sparkouttech.com/]. While AngularJS is still used today, its popularity has died down in favor of more current options like Angular 2+, React, and Vue. Performance Problems with AngularJS Performance was one of the biggest problems with raw AngularJS. This is due to the underlying \\"magic\\" that made AngularJS so popular in the first place. To achieve two-way data binding, AngularJS relies on a digest loop to keep the view in sync with its underlying data model. It works by incrementing all event handlers (clicks, ajax, timeouts) through a process called \\"dirty checking\\". Each scoped variable is compared to its previous value. Lunyr (Lun) If something changes, the observer and template are updated with the new value, and the process runs again to see if anything else has changed. In this way, the view is always in sync with the data model. The problem with the AngularJS digest loop is that it is unpredictable. As the application grows, the \\"checking\\" process becomes more intensive and can run indefinitely with bidirectional data flow. Angular 2+ to the rescue To address these issues, the Angular team rewrote the framework with the Flux architecture in mind. In particular, unidirectional data flow is the basis for redesigning change detection in Angular. Now the Angular framework is as fast as other alternatives. Compared to AngularJS, Angular can be more than 5 times faster. The Angular CLI also makes reducing the production bundle size a breeze, keeping Angular production lightweight. Corner advantage Angular offers many advantages over vanilla AngularJS: Performance: Angular is 5 times faster than AngularJS. This is because of the superior difference algorithm with unidirectional data flow and component-based architecture. Server-side Rendering Angular provides extensions for rendering the server side of an application. This is significant for SEO because some web crawlers cannot always crawl asynchronous content. Mobile Development As a framework, Angular makes it possible to develop applications that run on browsers and native devices such as iOS and Android. lazy loading Lazy loading allows you to load JavaScript components asynchronously based on routes. This can provide an additional performance benefit because the code is only imported when it is used. Tooling The tools provided by the TypeScript and NodeJS ecosystems should not be underestimated. Using the Angular CLI, you can quickly generate Angular components, services, directives, and more without having to manually copy/paste a bunch of boilerplate code. Reinstall Aol Desktop Gold Additionally, you can use the CLI to build and deploy your projects more easily. Should I use Angular or AngularJS? With performance advantages, Angular seems to be the best choice going forward. Getting to know the NodeJS/TypeScript ecosystem requires a lot of learning curve, and one of the few advantages of AngularJS is that it only runs in the browser. Using AngularJS makes sense if you have a small application and don't want to bother learning the ins and outs of NodeJS and TypeScript. There are also many existing projects already using AngularJS, and migrating to a new version may not justify the cost of learning and rewriting the code. Outside of these cases, adopting 'Angular' instead of raw 'AngularJS' is the first choice going forward."},{"prompt":"What is social media listening?","completion":"[LINKED_TEXT: The 8 Crazy Business Ideas list to Start a successfuul Business] [URL: https://www.hiddesoor.com/2023/07/8-crazy-business-ideas-list-to-start.html] Introduction; In the ever-evolving world of entrepreneurship, groundbreaking and innovative ideas are often the key to [LINKED_TEXT: success] [URL: https://www.hiddesoor.com/2023/07/8-crazy-business-ideas-list-to-start.html].

The sun provides heat and is part of the growth process for plants,and then animals because a lot of animals eat vegetation and other animals eat some of those animals. And most of the sun's heat is trapped in the atmosphere or is stored in decaying vegetation matter. So mankind existed for thousands of years using the sun's energy: some energy from passive solar and some from burning wood. The atmosphere has remained relatively stable with some fluctuations including ice age type changes. This worked well until humans discovered fossil fuels as an energy source for engines developed to use fossil fuels. Two big problems came from this: co2 and heat were released into the atmosphere when diesel engines and 2 stroke and later 4 stroke engines burned fossil fuels like coal and petroleum. Those engines inefficiency mean that more fuel gets burned to meet demands. 4 stroke engines are roughly 35 % efficient. 6 stroke engines are in development which might help some likely being 50% efficient . So we have been releasing more and more co2 into the atmosphere which has the effect of trapping that heat that the sun sends us everyday. So we need to stop changing energy sources releasing CO2 and heat. So there are several options including solar, wind, nuclear, biomass, and algae. These sources are not totally carbon free but they emit way less co2. Algae shows a huge potential because it converts co2 into o2. Currently we have the highest levels of co2 in our atmosphere in the last 650,000 years. A gallon of gas releases 19 pounds of carbon into the atmosphere."},{"prompt":"Which paper is used for origami?","completion":"Any paper you can fold; preferably square. The kinds of models you fold when you’re starting out (flapping bird, crane, waterbomb) will work just fine with printer paper or notebook paper. Once you learn to make a square from a rectangle, you can immediately take advantage of the near-infinite supply of discarded printouts near any printer. As you gain skill, you will start to find the paper growing bulky and unwieldy on certain models. That’s when you want to try the square, brightly colored paper that often comes in packs labeled ORIGAMI. (Links included at the end of this answer.) Within the origami community this material is known as ‘kami’, which (imaginatively enough) just means ‘paper’ in Japanese. This will get you an awfully long way. Almost everything you find in origami books below the super-advanced level can be folded just fine out of kami. Meanwhile, printer and notebook paper are still great for practice and just fooling around. I’m a lot more willing to pick up a sheet of printer paper and try out an idea, knowing that I’ll probably have to throw it away along with the next 10 variations, than I am to do the same thing to a nicer piece of paper. There are models that require paper with specific properties: stiffness, for example, or being exceptionally thin over a large area, or responding well to water, or being a US dollar bill. You’ll know it when you get to that stage. Here is a link to the Origami Source. They have lots and LOTS of different kinds of paper. [LINKED_TEXT: Paper | OrigamiUSA] [URL: https://origamiusa.org/catalog/paper] And here’s one specifically for kami, which is probably where you want to start. [LINKED_TEXT: Kami | OrigamiUSA] [URL: https://origamiusa.org/catalog/paper/type/kami] You can also find packs of origami paper in the craft section of any Michaels or Hobby Lobby or often even in Walmart. Remember, though — you’ll do just fine with almost any paper as long as you can turn it into a square.

And it's not really a bad sort of bias. The FT is biased in favour of the establishment, and what it takes to be economic competence. Currently, this equates to being pro-Tory. But it needn't be thus. Aspects of Blairism fit into the FT nook, too. Corbyn’s politics are anti-establishment, and some of them are quite divorced from economic orthodoxy. Does that make them bad policies? Well, that's a matter of opinion. The FT is a quality paper. If you read it (and nothing else), you would come away very well informed. I wouldn't describe it as “biased”, which seems to me to have a normative component (i.e. It's bad to be biased). Rather, I'd say that it has a perspective."},{"prompt":"What is difference between concave mirror and convex mirror?","completion":"Convex lenses are thicker at the middle. Rays of light that pass through the lens are brought closer together (they converge). A convex lens is a converging lens. When parallel rays of light pass through a convex lens, the refracted rays converge at the focal point. The image formed is (in most cases, but there are exceptions) real, inverted and magnified - you can use this lens as a magnifier, or a simple camera lens by itself. It’s also called “positive” lens. Concave lenses are thinner at the middle. Rays of light that pass through the lens are spread out (they diverge). A concave lens is a diverging lens. When parallel rays of light pass through a concave lens the refracted rays diverge so that they appear to come from one point called the principal focus. The image formed is virtual, upright and diminished. It’s also called “negative” lens. This lens can’t be used to form an image by itself, but in combination(s) with positive (converging) lenses it is used to shorten the focal length. This is just a basic, simple answer to your question. There are many types or shapes of concave / convex lenses (including their combinations) and I could easily go on for a week about optics :-D"},{"prompt":"What do you think about the new Marvel comics characters Safespace, Snowflake, Trailblazer, B Negative and Screentime from “The New Warriors?”","completion":"It’s pathetic.

And then there is this character, “Trailblazer.” No, i do not have anything against obese people, hear me out. We all know obesity is a major health problem. I was once obese back in the 3rd-5th grade. Creating characters telling younger obese readers to stay obese is not a good idea. It is super heroes that we are used to seeing that inspired me to lose the weight, and try my best to live healthier. This is not inspirational, this is just bad.

What should I do?","completion":"This is a difficult situation, especially since your partner and your therapy dog have both been important parts of your life for different lengths of time. There is no single, easy answer to this situation, as there are many factors to consider. The first thing to do is to assess why your partner doesn’t like your therapy dog. If your partner’s dislike is based on a legitimate concern, such as allergies or a fear of dogs, then it is important to consider their feelings and how to address them. It is important to try to find a compromise that both of you can be comfortable with. For example, you might consider asking your partner to stay in a different room when you are with your therapy dog, or taking extra precautions to keep the dog away from your partner. On the other hand, if your partner’s dislike of your therapy dog is simply because they don’t like animals, then it is important to talk to them about why they don’t like animals and to understand their perspective. In this case, it is important to remember that your relationship is still in its early stages and that you should try to be understanding of your partner’s feelings. No matter the reason for your partner’s dislike of your therapy dog, it is important to have an honest conversation about the issue. Talk to them about why they don’t like your therapy dog and how you feel about it. This conversation should focus on understanding each other’s perspectives and finding a way to move forward that is comfortable for both of you. It is also important to remember that your therapy dog has been a part of your life for 10 years and that you have a special bond with the dog. The dog has been a source of comfort, companionship, and support for you, and it is important to remember these benefits when discussing the issue with your partner. Finally, it is important to consider the future of your relationship. If your partner’s dislike of your therapy dog is something that you are unable to resolve, then it is important to consider if this is something that you can continue to accept in the long-term. If not, then it might be best to seek a different relationship in which both you and your partner feel comfortable and respected. In summary, it is important to assess why your partner doesn’t like your therapy dog, to have an honest conversation about the issue, and to remember the benefits that your therapy dog has brought to your life. It is also important to consider the future of your relationship and to seek a different relationship if needed. Please support my work by upvoting this article.

While it's natural to want fast results, it's essential to approach rapid weight loss with caution and prioritize your health. Instead, consider a balanced approach that promotes both weight loss and overall well-being. Set Realistic Goals: First and foremost, establish achievable and realistic weight loss goals. Understand that rapid weight loss is not always sustainable and may vary from person to person. Aim for a gradual and steady approach for lasting results.Focus on Nutrition: Prioritize a balanced and nutritious diet that includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats. Limit processed foods, sugary snacks, and excessive calorie intake.Control Portions: Pay attention to portion sizes to prevent overeating. Using smaller plates and practicing mindful eating can help you develop healthier eating habits.Stay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Adequate hydration can help you feel fuller and prevent unnecessary snacking.Regular Exercise: Incorporate regular physical activity into your routine. Find exercises you enjoy, such as walking, cycling, swimming, or dancing, and aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week.Limit Sugary Beverages: Cut down on sugary sodas, energy drinks, and other high-calorie beverages. Opt for water, herbal tea, or infused water instead.Get Enough Sleep: Prioritize quality sleep, as it plays a vital role in weight management. Lack of sleep can disrupt hormonal balance, leading to increased hunger and cravings.Reduce Stress: Manage stress through relaxation techniques like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises. High stress levels can trigger emotional eating and hinder weight loss progress.Seek Professional Guidance: If you're considering a quick weight loss plan, consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian. They can help you create a safe and effective weight loss strategy tailored to your needs.Be Patient and Persistent: Remember that lasting weight loss is a journey that requires dedication and consistency. Stay patient with yourself, and avoid getting discouraged by minor setbacks.

Thing is, since the 1970s there’s been a bit of a thing by certain science fiction authors to out-Star-Wars Star Wars. Although Lucas was really fascinated by classic science fiction when he devised the Empire, he never really put much thought into its scale or capabilities when composing the series. The most we get from Lucas’ chair is the sheer scale of the Galactic Senate. Which is so vague in how the galaxy is demarcated that senators could either represent huge swathes of the galaxy, or it’s not actually representing very many planets. This outdoing was most prominently done by the Culture as imagined by Iain M. Banks. Ships were often artificial intelligences who could fight full-scale skirmishes in microseconds using weapons that could potentially be considered war crimes. I’ve covered a few times why the Imperium of Man has the Empire beat, but essentially in terms of raw firepower and industrial output the latter does not compare.

A sort of world factbook ranking the potential technological and energy-production scale of as many science fiction civilisations as he can think of. Even at his most generous, imagining that the Galactic Empire could mass produce all its expanded universe supertoys, anything at the level of the Culture or beyond starts dwarfing them.

Why do other sci-fis woefully underestimate the population scale?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/Issac-Arthur-said-that-a-K2-civilization-can-easily-have-10-20-people-Is-Warhammer-40k-the-only-sci-fi-that-remotely-approaches-this-scale-Why-do-other-sci-fis-woefully-underestimate-the-population-scale/answer/Mark-Stamp-1] The Forerunner and early human empires in Halo were on the verge of physical transcendence while the Ori from Stargate were all-powerful gods in their home galaxy. But they had an advantage as technological transcendence was a nascent idea in 1977. By the 1990s and early 2000s (when Stargate and Halo ran), it was a growing trend thanks to the growing PC market. The Empire might be the philosophical benchmark for the classic evil galactic empire, but it’s surprisingly a more moderate and possibly underwhelming example for the genre."},{"prompt":"What are the musthave iPhone apps?

In opera, the focus in on the singing - Performers are primarily singers, and the whole proposal of Opera as a form of art is to show off great voice performances, sung by great singers. The story being told takes the background, and good acting is not as mandatory as having the best and most powerful voice. Altough some of the greatest opera singers are good actors too, who can convey powerful emotions on top of their marvelous vocal virtuosism (e. g. Maria Callas) Now, musicals are the other side of this coin. They are about the STORY and CHARACTERS. They are primarily THEATRE. While on opera, the story is there to support the music, in musicals it's the songs that are there to support the story. They are about telling a story, about projecting the character's emotions and connections to the audience. The song is just a tool used to enhance the character's emotions and thoughts. In short words: While operas are all about the singing, musicals are all about telling a story."},{"prompt":"f the Avengers Hulk fought King Kong, who would win?","completion":"I will give you a short answer- Thanos doesn’t have Hulk’s RAGE benefit(Angrier he is, more powerful he will become), still, he beat him to the pulp in Infinity war.

You have good 9-10 months in hand. That's an appropriate time to start with your preparation without overdoing or underdoing things. Listen or read about others but Make your own strategy. Don't follow something some one else has followed. They were not at your place.You can start by solving the GATE'16 papers online. Search about gate'16 online attempt by virtual Gate. If you can't find one for your stream, take the print and attempt offline. This could be helpful to realise what level you are at.Analyse the syllabus. Mark the Subjects with more weigtage and less weightage. Start preparing with more weightage subjects or something that interests you.Since, you have decided about going for coaching, revise what have been taught daily. But don't limit yourself to those notes. Refer standard books for topics you studied that day. Practice previous years on that topic and the questions in the booklet that your institute offers.Don't trust your institute or anyone blindly. Search over the internet, refer books in case of doubts.Join some Facebook group for GATE EC. This will expose you to a wide variety of questions.Don't just do a subject and then leave. Revise after 7-15 days. This is really important. I suffered because of this. Study daily and make short notes for every subject you study alongside.You can also use NPTEL lectures for topics you think you are weak in or aren't satisfied with what you've learnt.Normally, institutes tend to delay aptitude part till the end. Here, you need to work yourself. Do one topic of aptitude daily. It is the most underrated section of GATE. Doing aptitude would help you increase your IQ which is important in GATE. This will help you in campus recruitments too.Be patient when you attempt previous years. Don't just look at the question and see the answer.

In that movie the protagonist were getting divorced after 50 years of marriage. They had children even big big grandchildren and they were calculating how much alimony grandmother will get. He he…… anyways the movie became a huge hit and reporters actually went to the real life couples who were getting divorced after 30,35 or 45 years of marriage. On asking them the reason for divorce after such a long marriage almost everyone gave the same reason which goes something like this ————————— “ I have never lived life at our own will.I have always done what others expected us to do. Firstly I had to do what my parents wanted me to do, then I got married and always had to keep my partners preference above me ,then came kids and all my time went into bringing them up. Now My parents have expired, children are well settled and now I want to think about me and my happiness. I don't know how many days I have left with me but whatever even if I have 1 day to live I want to live it in my way, want to do what I want without waiting for somebody's permission ,without convincing somebody to let me do stuff and without feeling guilty for choosing my happiness. I want to do things only because I want to do even if its a waste of time or effort for others” Can you sense the regret, the pain in their words. So what are the things that you shouldn't do in life? You should never waste your life and cover it up under the blanket of love.You have just one life and you have all the right to live it to the fullest. Always remember doing unnecessary sacrifice for others is not greatness and thinking about your own happiness is not selfish. Never ever waste life for those narcissistic people because you can never ever please them no matter what you do. Those people who truly love you will be happy seeing you happy happy those people who just try to control your lives showing excessive love and care for you and makes you feel guilty if you ever think about yourself. Do yourself a favor stay away from these people. If you don't want to regret like them at old age for wasting your entire life doing nothing just being a machine with no wishes, no likes ,no dislikes ,no aim nothing.Just spending life somehow that too how others expect you to spend. Always following or believing whatever parents tell you won't make you a shravan kumar or kumari. P.s -This movie got released in 2015 and those couples were in late 60s or 70s. So this problem didn't start with our generation. It always existed.

I can’t find any such video- although that doesn’t per se mean it doesn’t exist 3 It suggests that Andrew is placing himself on a higher moral standing than Charles. That will be Airmiles Andy of Epstein fame. The most reviled member of the Royal Family who is assiduously keeping out of the limelight. Whose notion of truth is possibly rather questionable. 4 It suggests that Charles is in some way not suited to succeed, but succession doesn’t work like that. It pays no attention to strength of character. It just says the eldest son (now the eldest child) of the monarch is the successor So, one way or another, this story seems altogether bogus to me"},{"prompt":"What is something that you will never do?","completion":"नोटबंदी"},{"prompt":"What are some effective software tools that an inside sales team can use to boost productivity?","completion":"There are a lot of tools out there that help inside sales teams boost their productivity.
