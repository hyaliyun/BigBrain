In this article, we will guide you on how to create horizontal angry faces, vertical angry faces, and a table-flipping emoticon. To create a horizontal angry face, you can use the following keys: colon (:), hyphen (-), and the right parenthesis ()). The formation of this emoticon is as follows: \`: – )\`. This emoticon can be used to express mild to moderate annoyance or anger. However, if you want to depict more intense anger, you may opt for other emoticons. A vertical angry face can be created using the pipe symbol (|) to depict an angry face with gritted teeth. The formation of this emoticon is as follows: \`|:-)\`. This emoticon is quite similar to the horizontal one but vertical. It is used mostly when people are experiencing a more intense level of anger or frustration. Lastly, to create a table-flipping emoticon, you need to combine a few different symbols. The formation of this emoticon is as follows: \`/(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻\`. This emoticon effectively depicts a person flipping a table in anger, frustration or irritation. It is mostly used in memes and in humorous conversations to describe a frustrating situation. In conclusion, creating emoticons is a fun and creative way to express emotions while communicating with others, and angry faces are a great way to express frustration or irritation.

Justice Scalia, in dissent, says the ruling imperils the orderly system of criminal litigation Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"The US Supreme Court has made a ruling allowing an appeal from death row inmate Cory Maples, after a series of mistakes left him unable to pursue his appeals. Maples' legal team did not receive crucial paperwork from the court, and two attorneys who were supposed to represent him had left the law firm handling his case. In a rare move, the court found that the \\"uncommon combination of mishaps\\" justified allowing the appeal to proceed. However, the ruling has drawn criticism from Justice Scalia, who argues that it sets a dangerous precedent that undermines the \\"orderly system of criminal litigation.\\" He argues that it is ultimately the responsibility of the defendant to ensure that their legal team is competent and up-to-date on all developments in their case. The ruling and dissent in this case highlight the complex issues at play in the US criminal justice system, particularly when it comes to capital punishment. On the one hand, ensuring that defendants have access to a fair and robust appeals process is essential for upholding their constitutional rights. On the other hand, concerns about delays and procedural errors have led some to question whether the appeals process is being abused or manipulated. Ultimately, the Maples case serves as a reminder of the high stakes involved in death penalty cases, and the need for a just and transparent legal system to ensure that the rights of individuals are protected.

Choosing the wrong grind size can lead to a watery or bitter brew, while the perfect grind can enhance the flavor profile of your coffee. Here's a quick guide to help you choose the right grind for your coffee brewing needs. French Press: Coarse Grind For a French press, you need a coarse grind. The larger grind size provides more surface area, allowing for a slower extraction which results in a fuller-bodied cup of coffee. If you use a fine grind, it can result in over-extraction which leads to a bitter cup of coffee. Medium Grind: Multiple Brewing Methods A medium grind is a versatile option and works well with various brewing methods including drip, pour-over, and AeroPress. It allows for even extraction and creates a balanced cup of coffee. Espresso: Fine Grind Espresso requires a fine grind due to its short brewing time. This grind size provides a greater amount of surface area, allowing the water to extract flavors more quickly. Also, it helps create a high-pressure environment that produces a thicker, creamier shot. Turkish Coffee: Super Fine Grind Turkish coffee requires a super fine grind, almost to the consistency of fine sand. This grind size permits the coffee grounds to dissolve completely, creating a rich and robust flavor. The ground coffee should be almost powdery, and this method requires a specific preparation technique. In conclusion, choosing the right grind size for your coffee-respective brewing method is crucial to producing the perfect cup of coffee. Remember, a bad grind can ruin an outstanding coffee while the right grind can make a good coffee great. With this simple guide, you're ready to brew your perfect cup of coffee!"},{"prompt":"Write a tweet that is negative.","completion":"\\"I can't believe how terrible the customer service is at this restaurant.

Borrowing somewhat from the pneuma of Stoic physics, aether came to be regarded as the rarefied air from which it took its name, (see Aether (mythology)). Early theories of light posited a ubiquitous terrestrial and celestial medium through which light propagated. Additionally, the concept informed Isaac Newton's explanations of both refraction and of radiant heat. 19th century experiments into this luminiferous aether attempted to detect a minute drag on the Earth's orbit. While the Earth does, in fact, move through a relatively dense medium in comparison to that of interstellar space, the drag is so minuscule that it could not be detected.

Regardless of how cautious we are, we always seem to end up with at least one stain on our favorite shirt or dress. Ink stain is one of the most dreaded stains as it is usually challenging to remove. However, with a few simple steps, you can effectively remove ink stains from your clothes. The first step is to soak the stained garment in milk. Milk has enzymes that can break down the ink, making it easier to remove. Simply pour enough milk to cover the stain and let it soak for at least 30 minutes. If the ink is stubborn, you can leave it in the milk for several hours or even overnight. After soaking the garment in milk, treat any remaining ink stain with a powdered color-safe bleach. Make sure that you use a bleach that is appropriate for the color of the garment. Follow the instructions on the bleach package and gently rub the affected area with a soft brush. Rinse the garment with water and inspect to see if the stain has been removed entirely. If the ink stain persists, repeat the previous two steps until the stain is completely removed. It is important to resist the temptation to use hot water or a dryer as heat can set the stain permanently. Finally, launder the garment using your normal detergent. Be sure to check the label for particular washing instructions, and avoid using bleach or fabric softener. Once the garment is clean, inspect it thoroughly to ensure that the ink stain is no longer there. In conclusion, ink stains don't have to be permanent. The key is to act quickly and follow the proper steps to remove the stain. Soak the garment in milk, use a powdered color-safe bleach, and launder the garment following the washing instructions.

Deleting their number is a simple gesture but it can have a huge impact on your emotional well-being. It can prevent you from sending late-night texts or calls in a moment of weakness. Instead, try calling or texting someone else, like a friend or family member, to keep you distracted and supported. Another option is giving your phone to someone else for safekeeping.

These wires carry electric current to your home. But what is electric current? Electric current is actually the flow of electrons. You may recall, an electron is the outermost particle in an atom. They have a negative charge. Electricity is the continuous flow of these particles. Electrons are able to move through wires. Their speed can even be measured. The SI unit for electric current (or speed) is the ampere (A). Ampere is often shortened to amp. Electric current may flow in just one direction, or it may keep reversing direction. Direct current (DC) flows in only one direction. Direct current is what is used in devices like flashlights. Alternating current (AC) flows in two directions. This is the type of current that flows into your home through wires.

They are now being questioned by federal authorities, marking the second incident in which Afghan soldiers have gone missing in the country. The disappearance of foreign military personnel on American soil is a cause for concern, and raises questions about the screening process for these individuals. It is unclear why the officers went missing or what their intentions were, but the fact that they were found at the border suggests they may have been attempting to leave the country. The U.S. has been working closely with Afghan military forces for years, and U.S. military personnel often train Afghan soldiers in tactics and protocol. However, incidents like this highlight the potential risks involved in such collaborations. While it is important to maintain strong relationships with foreign allies, it is also crucial to ensure the safety and security of American citizens. The fact that these officers were able to go missing for an extended period of time is concerning, and it is important that steps are taken to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. The investigation into this latest incident is ongoing, and the government has not yet released any further details.

Mr Watts has shown up council 'jobsworths' who say road can't be fixed.","completion":"Mike Watts, a businessman from Somerset, recently made headlines after spending £150,000 of his own money to build a toll road. This came after a section of the A431 in Kelston collapsed and forced a 14-mile diversion, causing chaos for locals and tourists alike. Watts decided to take matters into his own hands when he saw that the council was not doing enough to fix the road. He felt that it was unacceptable to let people suffer due to the incompetence of the council, who had deemed the road too expensive to repair. The toll road which spans 365 metres, has been a huge success with locals, and has significantly cut down on travel time. The road is part of a private estate owned by Watts, and it is believed that he will recover his costs within three years. Watts has been praised for his entrepreneurial spirit and his willingness to take action where the council has failed. Many have called him a hero for his commitment to the community, and for showing up the council “jobsworths” who refused to fix the road. While some have criticised him for taking a short-term solution, others have lauded him for his ability to take action where others have failed. His actions have reignited the debate around the role of local governments and the need for individuals to take responsibility for their communities. In conclusion, Mike Watts’ act of building a toll road has been both controversial and commendable. While it has alleviated the immediate problem at hand, it also raises important questions about the responsibilities of local governments and the role of individuals in addressing community issues. However, for the people of Kelston, Watts is a hero who took matters into his own hands and got the job done."},{"prompt":"Perhaps the greatest question regarding the future development of transnational policing is: in whose interest is it?

US State Department said penalties would be imposed on China's Zhuhai Zhenrong.","completion":"The United States government has issued sanctions against three companies, with one of them being a major Chinese oil trader. The US State Department has announced that the penalties would be imposed on China's Zhuhai Zhenrong, as well as two other firms. This move by the US government is aimed at putting pressure on countries like China in order to ensure that harmful practices are curtailed. The sanctions against Zhuhai Zhenrong are yet another symptom of the ongoing trade war between the US and China. The US has been tacking a range of measures to try and even out the trade imbalance between the two countries, and has been taking steps to stop China from stealing intellectual property and forcing companies to hand over their technology. This has taken the form of tariffs on Chinese goods, as well as restrictions on investment in Chinese technology firms. These latest sanctions are part of a strategy designed to put pressure on China by cutting off access to its energy supplies. Zhuhai Zhenrong is a significant importer of Iranian oil, and so the sanctions are aimed at preventing the firm from continuing to do business with Iran. The sanctions will also likely have an impact on the Chinese economy, as Zhuhai Zhenrong is one of the country's largest oil traders. The US has been working hard to persuade countries to stop buying oil from Iran, but this has not been an easy task. Many countries rely on Iranian oil, and so have been reluctant to cut off their supplies. Furthermore, the US has not been the only country to issue sanctions against Iran. The EU has also imposed sanctions against the country, albeit not as stringent as those imposed by the US. Overall, the sanctions against Zhuhai Zhenrong are just part of a wider strategy to put pressure on countries like China to ensure they are playing fair when it comes to trade. The US has been using a range of tactics to try and achieve this goal, and it remains to be seen how successful they will be in the long run. However, the sanctions against Zhuhai Zhenrong are certainly a sign that the US government is not afraid to take decisive action against firms that it believes to be engaging in harmful practices."},{"prompt":"family offers, wellness offers, last minute offers, weekend offers and short holidays, easter offers in farmhouse, easter offers in umbria, christmas offers in farmhouse, christmas offers in tuscany, christmas offers in agriturismo on lake garda, new year in the farm Repeat this setence, but with the correct capitalization.","completion":"Family offers, wellness offers, last minute offers, weekend offers and short holidays, Easter offers in farmhouse, Easter offers in Umbria, Christmas offers in farmhouse, Christmas offers in Tuscany, Christmas offers in agriturismo on Lake Garda, New Year in the farm."},{"prompt":"Difference between sampling and population in research?

Be consistent on parenting approaches Be good role models. Be present. Present a united front.","completion":"Parenting Styles: Consistency, Good Role Modeling, Presence, and Unity Parenting is one of the most important roles in an individual's life. It shapes a child's character, values, and beliefs. As such, it is crucial to have parenting styles that foster healthy development in children. This article will discuss the key elements to consider when developing a nurturing parenting style. Consistency is Key One of the most important things parents can do is to establish consistency in their approach to parenting. Consistency involves setting clear expectations for their children and following through with consequences. By doing so, parents can establish a sense of routine and predictability in their child's life, instilling a sense of safety and security. Be a Good Role Model Parents should also be good role models. Children learn best from what they see rather than what they are told. Thus, it is essential for parents to model the behavior they want to see in their children. If parents want their children to be respectful, kind, and honest, they should display those traits consistently. Be Present In today's fast-paced world, parents often have busy lives. However, it is crucial for parents to make time for their children. Being present not only helps children feel valued and loved but also allows parents to get to know their children on a deeper level. Parents can establish routines such as eating family meals together, playing games, or taking walks to spend quality time with their children. Present a United Front Children can often sense when their parents are not on the same page. Therefore, it is essential for parents to present a united front to their children. If parents disagree on discipline, it is best to discuss and come up with a consistent approach. By presenting a united front, children can learn how to communicate their needs effectively while understanding that boundaries are essential. Conclusion Parenting is a challenging but rewarding task that comes with many responsibilities. By employing consistency, good role modeling, being present, and presenting a united front, parents can create a nurturing and secure environment for their children. Remember, parenting styles are not one-size-fits-all. Therefore, parents should experiment and see what works best for their family. The most important thing is to love, support, and guide their children to become healthy and responsible adults."},{"prompt":"What's the most logical way to complete this passage?

Before using the Magic Eraser tool, it's important to adjust the settings to get the best results. You can do this by clicking on the \\"Magic Eraser\\" option in the toolbar and adjusting the Tolerance and Anti-aliasing settings. The tolerance setting determines how closely the pixels you click on need to match in order to be erased. A higher tolerance will erase more pixels, while a lower tolerance will only erase pixels that are very similar in color. The anti-aliasing setting controls the sharpness of the edges created by the tool. Enabling anti-aliasing will create smoother edges, while disabling it will create harder edges. Once you've adjusted your settings, click on the background you want to remove. The Magic Eraser tool will automatically erase any pixels that are similar in color to the ones you clicked on. After erasing the background, you may notice that there are still some remnants of it left over. To get rid of these leftover pixels, use the regular Eraser tool to manually erase them. In summary, the Magic Eraser tool in Photoshop is a quick and efficient way to remove backgrounds from images. Remember to adjust the settings for the best results, and use the regular Eraser tool to clean up any leftover pixels."},{"prompt":"Premise: At the heart of the peninsula, the huge Taman Negara gives you the most comprehensive view of the country's animals and plants in their wild state.

To address this issue and boost economic growth, he suggests that the government should fund major investments in research and development.

Zakaria's views will be presented in an upcoming documentary titled \\"Restoring the American Dream.\\" The documentary will air on Saturday at 9 p.m. ET/PT and on Sunday at 10 a.m. ET/PT. The issue of overconsumption on credit has been a long-standing concern in the United States. Americans have been relying too heavily on credit to finance their purchases, leading to high levels of debt and vulnerability to economic shocks.

This investment would help spur innovation and create new industries that would boost economic growth. However, funding such investments would require new revenues. While some may call for raising taxes, Zakaria does not necessarily agree. He instead proposes other creative solutions, such as reforming the tax code to close loopholes and increase revenues.

There are various types of sources that researchers consider including books, academic journals, websites, and interviews. A critical step in the research process is using topical keywords to search for initial sources. These keywords help to identify sources that are more likely to be relevant to the research question.

Taking notes about each resource found is also crucial to keep track of information sources, avoid plagiarism, and easily refer back to important information during the writing process.

Dilation is the expansion of a material when it is subjected to heat or pressure, which alters the molecular configuration of the material. The measurement of dilation is essential in scientific research and engineering, as it helps to determine the characteristics and limitations of the material. In order to measure dilation, you must first have an understanding of the characteristics of the material you are testing. With this knowledge, a series of steps can be taken to measure the dilation of the material. First, a small sample of the material is cut into a specific size and shape. This sample is then placed into an apparatus that can measure the volume changes of the material. The next step is to subject the material to specific conditions such as temperature or pressure. Changes in temperature or pressure will cause the material to expand or contract, which can then be measured as a volume change. The fractional volume change of the material is then calculated by comparing the initial volume of the material to the new volume after being subjected to the specific conditions. The measurement of dilation is important in the study of many materials, including metals, ceramics, and polymers. For instance, the dilation of metals is essential in determining their behavior during welding or casting processes. In ceramics, dilation can help predict the cracking or warping of the material under different environmental conditions. In polymers, dilation can be measured to understand the durability and strength of the material. In conclusion, the measurement of proportional fractional volume change or dilation is crucial in understanding the characteristics and behaviors of materials. By analyzing the dilation of a material, scientists and engineers can determine the limitations and applications of the material in various industries. The study of dilation has played a significant role in advancing technology and improving our understanding of materials."},{"prompt":"The 1982 Nebraska vs. Penn State football game was an NCAA college football game held on September 25, 1982, during the 1982 NCAA Division IA football season at Beaver Stadium in State College, Pennsylvania, between the then#2 Nebraska Cornhuskers (coached by Tom Osborne) and then#8 Penn State Nittany Lions (coached by Joe Paterno).

Clouston had previously been convicted and served time for killing a police detective but became a fugitive after failing to register as a convicted sex offender. A tip from a viewer of \\"America's Most Wanted\\" led agents to Clouston's whereabouts, resulting in his capture. Clouston's crime spree started in 1984 when he shot and killed a police detective in Texas. He was later convicted and sentenced to life in prison but was released after just 20 years due to good behavior. However, his troubles did not end there. Upon his release, Clouston moved to California, where he was required to register as a convicted sex offender. Failure to do so resulted in him becoming a fugitive. The authorities had been searching for him ever since until a viewer of \\"America's Most Wanted\\" gave them a lead. According to officials, Clouston was living in a men's group home at the time of his arrest, and he did not resist being taken into custody peacefully. He is now in police custody and will likely face charges for failing to register as a convicted sex offender.

While there are certain things that may require the attention of a medical professional, there are also many minor issues that can be treated at home.

Lean forward slightly and avoid blowing your nose for a few hours after the bleeding has stopped. To reduce nausea and motion sickness, try drinking ginger tea or taking ginger supplements. Eczema and dermatitis can cause discomfort and itchiness. Applying aloe vera gel or coconut oil to the affected area can help soothe and heal the skin. For better sleep, consider creating a calming bedtime routine and using essential oils such as lavender. Treat dandruff and lice by washing your hair with tea tree oil shampoo or applying a mix of olive oil and tea tree oil to the scalp. Gastrointestinal issues such as gas, bloating, and indigestion can be alleviated by drinking peppermint tea or taking peppermint capsules. For insomnia, try avoiding caffeine and electronics before bedtime, and consider drinking chamomile tea or taking melatonin supplements. Taking care of your heart is essential for overall health. Consuming a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help protect your heart, as can exercising regularly and maintaining a healthy weight.

Position the claw over the selected toy. Drop the claw when you think you've got it. Watch the claw with 100 percent focus. Adapt to the results of your fishing. If you haven't won, repeat the process to try again.","completion":"When it comes to playing arcade games, one of the most exciting options available is the claw machine. These machines allow you to try your hand at grabbing a toy or prize with a mechanical claw. However, as anyone who has played one of these games knows, they can be challenging. With a few key tips, though, you can increase your chances of success. The first step in winning at the claw machine is choosing the right machine to play. Some machines might have weaker claws, while others might be set up to make it nearly impossible to win certain prizes. Look for a machine that has a good track record of players winning, and one that seems to grab the toys and prizes with a strong claw. Once you've picked the machine you want to play, it's time to choose your target toy. Take a look at the options available, and figure out which toy you want to try to win. Take into account the size and weight of the toy, as well, since these factors will impact how the claw interacts with it. Next, position the claw over the selected toy. Make sure the claw is lined up well, and that it's directly above the toy you're trying to win. Take your time with this step, and be patient - rushing can lead to costly errors. Once you're confident that the claw is in the right position, it's time to drop it. Press the button or lever that will cause the claw to drop, and watch it with 100 percent focus. Try to anticipate how it will pick up the toy, and be ready to react if it doesn't quite go as you've planned. Adapting to the results of your \\"fishing\\" is the next crucial step. If you've won, congratulations - now retrieve your prize and enjoy it! However, if you haven't won, don't get discouraged. Take a look at your approach, and think about what you could do differently. Maybe you need to adjust your positioning, or maybe you need to choose a different toy to target. Whatever the case, tweak your approach and try again. Remember, practice makes perfect, and the more you play the claw machine, the better you'll get at it. By following these steps and adapting as needed, you can increase your chances of winning and walk away with a fun prize."},{"prompt":"wonder how he expects us to put forward a strong position on these issues if we are not part of the World Trade Organization or if we were not in a position, with meetings like Seattle, where we can pull together different countries from around the world that have a similar position to ours.

Respect her boundaries and remember that she’s a human being with her own thoughts and feelings. Last, but not least, be sure to correspond with her after the date to give closure. Whether it’s a text or a call, let her know that you had a great time and would be interested in seeing her again. This small gesture can make all the difference in showing her that you’re a gentleman who’s truly interested in her as a person. In summary, chivalry is not dead – it’s just evolved. By following these simple tips, you can demonstrate your respect, your consideration, and your genuine interest in your date.

In 1919, he instituted the appointment of a director in each congregation, and a year later all members were instructed to report their weekly preaching activity to the Brooklyn headquarters. At an international convention held at Cedar Point, Ohio, in September 1922, a new emphasis was made on housetohouse preaching. Significant changes in doctrine and administration were regularly introduced during Rutherford's twentyfive years as president, including the 1920 announcement that the Jewish patriarchs (such as Abraham and Isaac) would be resurrected in 1925, marking the beginning of Christ's thousandyear Kingdom. Disappointed by the changes, tens of thousands of defections occurred during the first half of Rutherford's tenure, leading to the formation of several Bible Student organizations independent of the Watch Tower Society, most of which still exist. By mid1919, as many as one in seven of Russellera Bible Students had ceased their association with the Society, and as many as twothirds by the end of the 1920s.

Haiti claims its under17 team was forced to withdraw from a tournament hosted by Jamaica. The row centers over two Haitian players who were suspected of having malaria. Jamaica insists the matter is now resolved but the Haitians want an apology.","completion":"Jamaica and Haiti's Latest Dispute Over Soccer Jamaica and Haiti have been caught in a dispute over soccer that has heightened tensions between the two neighboring nations. It all started when Haiti's under-17 team was forced to withdraw from a tournament hosted by Jamaica. The row centers over two Haitian players who were suspected of having malaria. Haiti claims that the Jamaican authorities did not follow proper procedures in testing the players for malaria. The Haitian team was required to undergo a blood test upon arrival in Jamaica, but the results came back with only one of the players flagged for having malaria. Haiti's team doctor disputed the test results as the player had taken medication for the disease and insisted on retesting him along with his teammate. However, Jamaica refused to do so, citing their strict adherence to FIFA's health protocols. Jamaica, on the other hand, argues that the matter has been resolved. The Jamaican Football Federation issued a statement, stating that they \\"acted in good faith and followed the necessary procedures as laid down in FIFA's regulations.\\" They went on to say that they provided \\"logistical and medical support\\" to the Haitian team throughout their stay in Jamaica. Despite that, the Haitians are demanding an apology from the Jamaican authorities, claiming that it was unfair to penalize two players and prevent their team from competing in the tournament. This isn't the first time that the two nations have had an issue with sports. In 2015, Jamaica's women's national team was forced to cancel a friendly match in Haiti due to security concerns. The dispute over soccer has once again highlighted the existing tensions between Jamaica and Haiti, two neighboring nations with a shared history but divergent political, economic, and cultural realities. The issue has sparked a debate over the effectiveness and fairness of international sports regulations, especially when it comes to safeguarding the health and wellbeing of athletes. In conclusion, while Jamaica and Haiti's latest dispute may have been over soccer, it has brought to the forefront of the political divide between the two nations. The Haitian government's request for an apology is unlikely to resolve the underlying issues, but it underscores the need for both countries to find common ground and work towards building a peaceful relationship based on mutual respect and understanding."},{"prompt":"the Viking Age it was not uncommon to bury silver hoards Can you repeat this sentence, but add in punctuation?","completion":"\\"In the Viking Age, it was not uncommon to bury silver hoards.\\""},{"prompt":"Generate a movie review with negative sentiment.","completion":"The movie was an absolute disaster.

First and foremost, it's important to use fresh produce at its peak ripeness. Not only will this ensure that your baby is getting the most nutrients possible, but it will also make the food more palatable. When shopping for produce, it's also a good idea to choose organic whenever possible. Organic produce is grown without the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, which can be harmful to both human health and the environment. It's also important to know which foods your baby can eat. Generally, babies can start eating solid foods between four and six months of age. Good options include pureed fruits and vegetables, as well as iron-fortified cereals. Be sure to introduce one new food at a time and wait a few days before introducing another to watch for any signs of an allergic reaction. On the flip side, there are some foods that babies shouldn't consume. Honey, for example, can contain spores of Clostridium botulinum bacteria that can cause infant botulism. Cow's milk, which can be hard for babies to digest, is also not recommended until after their first birthday. And while fish can be a healthy source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids, certain types – like shark and swordfish – can contain high levels of mercury that could harm a baby's developing nervous system.

Turkic tribesmen were first used in the Abbasid army as mamluks (slavewarriors), replacing Iranian and Arab elements within the army. As a result, the mamluks gained a significant political power. In 999, large portions of Iran came briefly under the rule of the Ghaznavids, whose rulers were of mamluk Turk origin, and longer subsequently under the Turkish Seljuk and Khwarezmian empires. These Turks had been Persianized and had adopted Persian models of administration and rulership. The Seljuks subsequently gave rise to the Sultanate of Rum in Anatolia, while taking their thoroughly Persianized identity with them. The result of the adoption and patronage of Persian culture by Turkish rulers was the development of a distinct TurkoPersian tradition.

Remove your thawed pizza from the box. Brush the crust with olive oil for additional flavor and crunch.","completion":"Pizza is one of the most popular foods in the world, and for good reason. It's delicious, versatile, and can be customized to suit any taste. However, there are a few things you need to keep in mind when preparing pizza, especially if you're working with a frozen one. One of the most important things you need to do is to allow your pizza to defrost for 1-2 hours. This is important because if you try to cook a frozen pizza, the outside will burn while the inside remains frozen. To defrost your pizza, you can either leave it out on the counter or put it in the fridge for a few hours. Whatever you do, make sure to never defrost your pizza in the microwave, as this will make the crust soggy. Once your pizza is thawed, you can remove it from the box. This is a good time to preheat your oven to 425°F. While you're waiting for the oven to heat up, you can brush the crust with olive oil for additional flavor and crunch. This step is optional, but highly recommended. Not only does the olive oil give the crust a great flavor, but it also helps it to crisp up in the oven. When your pizza is ready, put it on a baking sheet or directly on the oven rack. Cook it for about 10-12 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly and the crust is golden brown. Make sure to keep an eye on the pizza while it's cooking, as cooking times may vary from oven to oven. In conclusion, pizza is a delicious and versatile food that can be enjoyed in many different ways. However, if you're working with a frozen pizza, it's important to remember to defrost it first and brush the crust with olive oil for extra flavor and crunch. With these tips, you're sure to enjoy a perfect pizza every time!"},{"prompt":"When we returned home , I went to the top of my refrigerator where I kept my cigars in a basket .

The CIA discovered the misidentifications in 'Operation Blue Book' One UFO expert is unconvinced, however, saying it is 'ironic' the CIA would reveal this on World UFO Day. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"In a surprising turn of events, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has claimed responsibility for several UFO sightings during the 1950s. According to the CIA, lights over Norway at the time can be attributed to their U-2 aircraft, which began operating secretly in 1955 and remains in use to this day. The U-2 aircraft is capable of flying up to 70,000 feet, which made it much higher than conventional planes in the 50s and 60s. This meant that when pilots saw sunlight glare off the planes above them, they reported it as UFO sightings since they were unaware of the U-2's existence. The CIA discovered the misidentifications in 'Operation Blue Book', a study conducted by the agency to investigate reports of unidentified flying objects. However, some experts remain unconvinced by the CIA's claims. It seems ironic to them that the CIA would reveal this information on World UFO Day. The idea of UFOs and extraterrestrial life has always fascinated and intrigued people, and it's not every day that a government agency admits to being responsible for several sightings. This revelation by the CIA is likely to fuel further speculation and interest in the subject. It raises questions about the extent of government involvement in the UFO phenomenon and whether there are any other cases of misidentifications or cover-ups. It's fascinating to see how much technology has advanced since the 1950s, and it's a reminder that perceptions and beliefs can change with time. In conclusion, the CIA's statement sheds new light on several UFO sightings that had puzzled many people over the years. While there may be some skepticism about the CIA's claims, it's an intriguing development that adds to the fascination surrounding the topic of extraterrestrial life."},{"prompt":"drove from Sacramento to San Francisco (and back) to see this movie premiereand really glad I did.

If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable. Dark meat, which avian myologists refer to as red muscle, is used for sustained activity—chiefly walking, in the case of a chicken.
