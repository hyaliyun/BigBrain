The study found that there were approximately 2.5 million cross-references throughout the dictionary, compared to only 119,284 etymologies. This means that there are over 20 times more cross-references than etymologies in the dictionary. Cross-references are used in the dictionary to direct readers to related words, phrases or concepts that may be helpful in understanding the definition of a particular word. Etymologies, on the other hand, are the study of the origin and history of words, including their meanings, development, and changes over time. Etymologies are included in the dictionary because they can provide insight into the current usage of a word and how its meaning has evolved over the years. While the large number of cross-references in the Oxford English Dictionary may seem overwhelming at first, they can be incredibly helpful to readers who are trying to understand the meaning of a particular word. By providing additional context and related concepts, cross-references can help readers to better comprehend the meaning of a word and its place in the English language. Overall, the study of the 2005 Oxford English Dictionary found that cross-references outnumbered etymologies by a significant amount. While both cross-references and etymologies have an important role to play in understanding the English language, the abundance of cross-references in the dictionary is a testament to just how interconnected and complex the English language can be."},{"prompt":"w similar are the following two sentences?

The mouth is surrounded by strong lips, which act like a hand to grab pieces of dead grass, leaves, and weeds, with bits of soil to help chew. The lips break the food down into smaller pieces. In the pharynx, the food is lubricated by mucus secretions for easier passage. The esophagus adds calcium carbonate to neutralize the acids formed by food matter decay. Temporary storage occurs in the crop where food and calcium carbonate are mixed. The powerful muscles of the gizzard churn and mix the mass of food and dirt. When the churning is complete, the glands in the walls of the gizzard add enzymes to the thick paste, which helps chemically breakdown the organic matter. By peristalsis, the mixture is sent to the intestine where friendly bacteria continue chemical breakdown. This releases carbohydrates, protein, fat, and various vitamins and minerals for absorption into the body.

It also highlights the importance of accuracy and consistency, as even a few yards can be the difference between a successful and unsuccessful kick.

One possible pathophysiologic explanation of intersex in humans is a parthenogenetic division of a haploid ovum into two haploid ova. Upon fertilization of the two ova by two sperm cells (one carrying an X and the other carrying a Y chromosome), the two fertilized ova are then fused together resulting in a person having dual genitalial, gonadal (ovotestes) and genetic sex. Another common cause of being intersex is the crossing over of the SRY from the Y chromosome to the X chromosome during meiosis. The SRY is then activated in only certain areas, causing development of testes in some areas by beginning a series of events starting with the upregulation of SOX9, and in other areas not being active (causing the growth of ovarian tissues).

If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable. Occupancy sensors to allow operation for whenever someone is within the area being scanned can control lighting. When motion can no longer be detected, the lights shut off. Passive infrared sensors react to changes in heat, such as the pattern created by a moving person. The control must have an unobstructed view of the building area being scanned. Doors, partitions, stairways, etc. will block motion detection and reduce its effectiveness. The best applications for passive infrared occupancy sensors are open spaces with a clear view of the area being scanned. Ultrasonic sensors transmit sound above the range of human hearing and monitor the time it takes for the sound waves to return. A break in the pattern caused by any motion in the area triggers the control. Ultrasonic sensors can see around obstructions and are best for areas with cabinets and shelving, restrooms, and open areas requiring 360degree coverage. Some occupancy sensors utilize both passive infrared and ultrasonic technology, but are usually more expensive. They can be used to control one lamp, one fixture or many fixtures.

First and foremost, you should look for jeans that match your measurements. This means taking the time to measure your waist and inseam so that you can find a pair of jeans that will fit comfortably. If you plan on wearing the jeans with raised shoes, you'll want to add a little extra length to your measurements. This will ensure that the jeans don't ride up when you walk, which can be uncomfortable and unflattering. Another thing to consider when shopping for jeans is the material. Some jeans are made from materials that are prone to shrinking. If you're not careful, you could end up with a pair of jeans that are too small after just one wash. To avoid this, be sure to check the label and look for jeans made from materials that are less likely to shrink. In addition to these tips, there are a few other things you can do to ensure that your jeans fit perfectly. For example, don't be afraid to try on different sizes and styles to see what works best for you. And, if you find a pair of jeans that you love but they don't quite fit right, consider taking them to a tailor. A few simple alterations can make a big difference in how your jeans look and feel. At the end of the day, finding the perfect pair of jeans is all about taking the time to find a pair that matches your measurements, fits comfortably, and is made from high-quality materials. With a little patience and persistence, you can find a pair of jeans that will look great and last for years to come."},{"prompt":"When an inductive circuit is opened, the current through the inductance collapses quickly, creating a large voltage across the open circuit of the switch or relay. If the inductance is large enough, the energy will generate a spark, causing the contact points to oxidize, deteriorate, or sometimes weld together, or destroying a solidstate switch. A snubber capacitor across the newly opened circuit creates a path for this impulse to bypass the contact points, thereby preserving their life; these were commonly found in contact breaker ignition systems, for instance. Similarly, in smaller scale circuits, the spark may not be enough to damage the switch but will still radiate undesirable radio frequency interference (RFI), which a filter capacitor absorbs. Snubber capacitors are usually employed with a lowvalue resistor in series, to dissipate energy and minimize RFI. Such resistorcapacitor combinations are available in a single package.

The main problem of this movie is that actors aren't capable of holding this movie on their back. Why? Because of bad script. Although Dillon, Lane and Jones try very hard to take this movie on another level, there is no innovative storytelling and the direction is too ordinary. So for Matt Dillon fans this is watchable movie, just like for admirers of beautiful Diane Lane. Legendary Tommy Lee Jones is always great but this is not movie for him; far below his level. So if you get hooked up by this great cast watch it but don't expect anything big or extraordinary.

Major pubertal and biological changes include changes to the sex organs, height, weight, and muscle mass, as well as major changes in brain structure and organization. Cognitive advances encompass both increases in knowledge and in the ability to think abstractly and to reason more effectively. The study of adolescent development often involves interdisciplinary collaborations. For example, researchers in neuroscience or biobehavioral health might focus on pubertal changes in brain structure and its effects on cognition or social relations. Sociologists interested in adolescence might focus on the acquisition of social roles (e.g., worker or romantic partner) and how this varies across cultures or social conditions. Developmental psychologists might focus on changes in relations with parents and peers as a function of school structure and pubertal status.

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"President Obama increased drone attacks in Pakistan during his tenure, which have been highly controversial due to reports of civilian casualties. Roughly a quarter of those killed in the drone strikes were believed to be non-combatants. However, some argue that the use of drones is the most viable option for the US in their fight against militants in the region. Drone strikes have been criticized for their lack of transparency and accountability. Critics argue that the US has not adequately investigated civilian deaths resulting from the attacks and that the program violates international law by carrying out extrajudicial killings. Despite these criticisms, supporters of the drone program argue that it is a necessary tool in the US's fight against militant groups, such as al Qaeda and the Taliban. The remote nature of drone strikes allows for targeted killings without putting US troops at risk. Additionally, supporters argue that drones are a more precise tool than traditional airstrikes and can minimize collateral damage. The debate over the use of drone strikes is unlikely to be resolved any time soon. However, the ongoing conflict in Pakistan and other regions in the Middle East and Africa will likely continue to necessitate their use. As the US navigates this complex geopolitical landscape, it will need to balance the potential benefits of drone strikes with the risks and ethical considerations associated with their use."},{"prompt":"Write a title: The revitalized San Diego Chargers showed why they keep winning, and the distraught Kansas City Chiefs showed why they continue to lose.","completion":"Title: San Diego Chargers Win while Kansas City Chiefs Lose."},{"prompt":"Generate a sentence that describes the following data: Alhambra, shipPower, Geared steam engine Humphrys, Tennant and Dykes 140hp; Alhambra, length, 63800.0 (millimetres)","completion":"The Alhambra ship is equipped with a geared steam engine Humphrys, Tennant and Dykes 140hp and has a length of 63800.0 millimeters."},{"prompt":"Keywords: change, event, protest What is a sentence that includes all these keywords?","completion":"The protest aimed to change the course of the event."},{"prompt":"Sentence: Ampara Hospital is located in Eastern Province, Sri Lanka where the Eastern Provincial Council is the governing body and Austin Fernando is the leader.

Identify the root note of a chord. Hear the difference between major and minor chords. Find sharps and flats. Start with simple chords. Read the next part of the notation to build the chord. Memorize common chords.","completion":"Playing chords on a guitar or piano is a key skill for any aspiring musician. However, learning to read chord charts and identify the notes and intervals within chords can be daunting. Here are some tips to help you get started. Firstly, find a chord chart - this is a visual representation of different chords that you can play on your instrument. These diagrams show the position of your fingers on the frets or keys, and also indicate the notes that make up the chord. Next, identify the root note of the chord. This is the base note of the chord and is often indicated by a letter (e.g. C). Understanding the root note is crucial for building and understanding different chords. To hear the difference between major and minor chords, pay attention to the overall sound of the chord. Major chords tend to sound bright and happy, while minor chords have a more somber or melancholic feel. Keep practicing and soon you'll be able to identify these differences by ear. Sharps and flats can also be tricky to identify, but they play an important role in building chords. Sharps indicate that the note should be played one semitone higher, while flats indicate one semitone lower. These notes often occur in scales, and understanding their placement within chords will help you to play more complex songs and progressions. When starting out, focus on learning simple chords such as C major, G major, and D major. These are common chords that form the basis of many popular songs. To build a chord, read the next part of the notation. This might be a seventh, a ninth, or other extensions to the basic chord. Learning these extensions will allow you to add more complexity to your playing. Finally, memorize common chords! Once you have a solid grasp of the basic chords, work on memorizing the more complex ones. This will allow you to more easily transition between chords when playing songs, and expand your repertoire of music. By following these tips, you'll be well on your way to becoming a proficient chord player. While it can be challenging at first, consistent practice and patience will have you playing beautiful music in no time."},{"prompt":"Generate a sentence about this data: Alison O'Donnell, genre, Psychedelic folk","completion":"Alison O'Donnell's genre is psychedelic folk."},{"prompt":"A friend was picking up lunch today.

Fortunately, there are several things you can do to help solve this problem. One of the first things you should consider is relocating your cat's litter box. However, this should be done gradually so that your cat can get used to the new location. Another helpful tip is to light up any dark spaces that your cat may have started to urinate, as cats tend to prefer bright, open areas. If you have carpet runners or rugs in your home, consider flipping them upside down. This can help discourage your cat from peeing on them. Additionally, double-sided sticky tape can be applied to furniture as a deterrent. If your cat does have an accident outside of the litter box, it's important to clean it up thoroughly with an enzymatic cleaner. This will help remove any odor, which can otherwise encourage your cat to keep peeing in that spot. Another thing to consider is trimming the long hair around your cat's hindquarters. This can help prevent urine from getting trapped in the fur, which can be uncomfortable for your cat and may also contribute to the problem.

This will allow you to easily access and enjoy your snack. It is important to note that edamame can be served either hot or cold, so feel free to adjust the temperature to your liking. Next, it's time to eat! Edamame is typically eaten by squeezing the pod between your teeth and pulling out the beans. Some people prefer to eat the pods themselves, but this is a matter of personal preference. Once you have had your fill of edamame, it's time to store any leftovers. To do this, simply place the edamame in an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator. Leftover edamame can be reheated, added to salads or soups, or even used as a topping for pizza. Overall, enjoying cooked edamame is as simple as placing it in a bowl, eating it, and storing any leftovers properly.

It's also important to be realistic about your chances of success. Modeling is a highly competitive industry, and even the most skilled and talented individuals may not make it to the top.

They can offer guidance and support and help you make informed decisions about your career. It's important to consider the potential challenges and pitfalls of modeling as well, such as the risks associated with being in the public eye and the demands of the industry. If you're serious about pursuing modeling, consider attending modeling school. This can be a great way to learn the skills and techniques necessary for success in the industry. Look for reputable programs that have a track record of success and can help you build a strong foundation for your career. Studying magazines is also a great way to familiarize yourself with the industry and get a sense of what kinds of looks and styles are in demand. Pay attention to the types of models featured in different publications and try to identify what sets them apart. Finally, it's important to maintain a healthy weight.

During his 11-year career, he intercepted a total of 26 passes. To determine how many points were scored off of Rolle's interceptions, we need to look at the return yards for each interception and whether or not they resulted in touchdowns. According to NFL.com, Rolle's 26 interceptions resulted in a total of 413 return yards. Unfortunately, not all of those interceptions resulted in touchdowns. In fact, Rolle only scored two pick-sixes during his career. The first one was in 2007 while he was playing for the Cardinals, and the second one was in 2014 when he was with the Giants. A pick-six occurs when a defender intercepts a pass and returns it for a touchdown. When this happens, the defense is awarded six points for the touchdown, and the player who scored the touchdown is credited with an interception return touchdown (also known as an \\"INT TD\\"). In Rolle's case, his two pick-sixes resulted in a total of 12 points. So, to answer the original question, a total of 12 points were scored off of Antrel Rolle's interceptions during his NFL career. While he was a dominant defender, his interceptions did not always result in touchdowns, and the ones that did were relatively rare occurrences. Nevertheless, his ability to create turnovers and disrupt opposing offenses made him a valuable player throughout his career."},{"prompt":"Taxi Driver: Oko Ashewo, also known as just Taxi Driver or Oko Ashewo, is a 2015 Nigerian dark comedy thriller film produced by Ayobami Macaulay and directed by Daniel Oriahi.

If the vessel is indeed the Santa Maria, it would be a major discovery, as the ship's fate has remained unknown for centuries. The Santa Maria was lost after running aground on a reef off the coast of present-day Haiti, forcing Columbus to leave some of his men behind and return to Spain in a smaller vessel.

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Technology is proving to be a useful tool in identifying offenders, according to research from UK universities. One technique involves using the eye's pupil as a mirror to catch images of people. This method requires photos to be shot in high-resolution to be effective. Through this approach, law enforcement officials can use the images captured in the eye's pupil to identify suspects with greater accuracy. The researchers say that this technology could be particularly helpful in cases where there are no other viable leads. While it is not a foolproof method, the use of high-resolution photos can significantly increase the chances of capturing useful evidence. It is important to note that this technique should only be used in conjunction with other traditional methods of investigation, such as witness interviews and DNA analysis. Overall, the potential benefits of this technology in law enforcement cannot be understated. With the ability to capture clear images of suspects, it could help solve cases that would have otherwise gone unsolved.

As Yahoo Sports explains, the velvet covering the antlers is harvested in New Zealand, ground into a powder, and sold in the US, most commonly as a 68abottle spray. The problem is that it naturally contains IGF1, a substance banned by the NFL and most sports leagues because it's essentially a human growth hormone, writes Dan Wetzel.

The NFL is concerned enough that it ordered Oakland Raiders coach Hue Jackson to cut ties with a company called Sports With Alternatives To Steroids (S.W.A.T.S.) that sells the stuff, reports ThePostGame. The company's owner says he gave samples of Ultimate Spray to Jackson when he was with the Ravens, as well as to other assistant coaches and players such as Ravens star Ray Lewis and Bengals safety Roy Williams.

One crucial aspect is building a strike fund. This fund will help sustain the strikers during the duration of the strike. To start, a budget must be created to determine the amount needed to sustain the strike. This budget should include expenses such as food, transportation, and healthcare. It's essential to account for unexpected expenses, so it's recommended to allocate an additional amount for contingencies. In coordination with the budget, arrangements must be made with local food banks for the supply of food for the strikers. This partnership will ensure that the striking individuals have access to nutritious meals throughout the strike. It's helpful to create a schedule for meal distribution to avoid food wastage. Another crucial element to consider is healthcare. The strikers must have access to basic healthcare, especially if the strike lasts for an extended period. It's advisable to coordinate with local healthcare providers to provide primary care services for the striking individuals. For individuals renting apartments, a form letter must be created. This letter should be given early on to inform landlords about the strike and request a stay of rent for the duration of the strike. It is ideal to have legal representation during this process, and a designated person should take charge of negotiating tenants' rights. Finally, transportation can be a major issue when striking. To prevent this issue, a transportation budget should be included in the overall budget. This budget should be allocated to pay for bus fare or other means of transportation for strikers who require it. In conclusion, organizing a strike can be a daunting task, but thorough planning will ensure that the striking individuals are taken care of, and their needs are met. Building a strike fund, creating a budget, coordinating with food banks, arranging healthcare services, creating a form letter, and arranging transportation are all essential elements when organizing a strike. By following these steps, strikers can be confident that all contingencies are accounted for, and they can focus on their cause."},{"prompt":"the following sentence linguistically acceptable?

One crucial aspect of respectful parenting is respecting your teen's privacy. Adolescence is a time of self-discovery, and giving your teen some space can help them develop their identity. However, respecting your teen's privacy doesn't mean giving them complete autonomy. As a parent, you still have a responsibility to ensure their safety and well-being. It's important to establish trust with your teen, which can be achieved by having open and honest conversations with them. Giving your teen some say in major decisions is another aspect of respectful parenting. While you may have the final say, it's important to involve them in the decision-making process. This can help them develop their critical thinking skills and feel empowered, which can ultimately lead to greater self-confidence. Finally, it's important to keep your teen's confidences. As a parent, it's natural to want to share your child's accomplishments or struggles with others. However, respecting your teen's privacy means not revealing what they've shared with you without their permission. This can help your teen develop trust in you and feel comfortable coming to you for advice or support. In summary, respectful parenting requires giving your teen some space while still maintaining your parental responsibilities. Establishing trust, involving them in major decisions, and keeping their confidences can all help develop a positive and respectful relationship between you and your teen."},{"prompt":"was fascinated as to how truly bad this movie was.

The Ashkelon seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) plant, the largest in the world, was voted 'Desalination Plant of the Year' in the Global Water Awards in 2006.

In fact, the majority of households in the United States are now owner-occupied. As of 2019, approximately 65% of all occupied housing units in the U.S. were owner-occupied, while the other 35% were rental units. This represents a shift from the mid-2000s when the percentage of owner-occupied homes was higher. The overall trend of increasing homeownership can be seen across all racial and ethnic groups, but there are still disparities. White households have the highest rates of homeownership at 74%, while Black households have the lowest rates at just over 42%. Of course, there are benefits and drawbacks to both renting and owning a home. Owning a home can provide a sense of stability and control over one's living space, but also comes with the responsibility of maintenance and mortgage payments. Renting can be more flexible and require less upfront costs, but also means less control over living space and possibly less stability in the long-term. Despite the overall trend towards homeownership, it's important to recognize that renting is still a viable and necessary option for many individuals and families. The availability of affordable rental housing, along with policies that promote homeownership opportunities, are important for ensuring access to safe and stable housing for all."},{"prompt":"Disney might just be on to something here.

But how do you break in a new glove to make sure it's game-ready? Here are four simple tips: 1. Use the glove to play catch: One of the best ways to break in a new glove is to simply use it. Catching a baseball repeatedly will help to soften the leather and mold the glove to your hand. 2. Knead the glove by hand: Another technique is to knead the glove by hand. Use your palms and fingers to apply pressure to the leather, working it back and forth until it becomes more pliable. 3. Rough up the glove: To speed up the process, rough up the glove by rubbing it against a hard surface, like a wall or a bat. This will help to soften the leather and create a pocket for the ball to sit in. 4. Sleep on the glove: For a more unconventional approach, try sleeping on the glove. This will help to shape the pocket and break in the leather as you move around during the night. Whether you choose to use your glove regularly, knead it by hand, rough it up, or even sleep on it, with these tips, you'll have a well-broken-in glove and be ready to hit the field in no time."},{"prompt":"Snapchat deleted my recent memories, how do I get them back?

Curators at the Doncaster Museum and Art Gallery have stated that the county features heavily in literature about the notorious outlaw. Robin Hood's remains are also believed to be buried in Kirklees, West Yorkshire. The officials have claimed that the church where Robin Hood married Maid Marian is located in Doncaster. These findings challenge previous assumptions about the origins of Robin Hood, which were mainly based on accounts suggesting he was based in Nottinghamshire. The supposed involvement of Yorkshire in Robin Hood's story is not new. Some literary sources indeed describe Robin Hood as originating from Barnsdale, a region in the county. But these claims have not been widely accepted as conclusive. The new evidence includes references to Robin Hood in historical records from the area, such as legal documents and place-names. The Doncaster curators also noted that Robin Hood is celebrated in local folklore, and that a statue of him stands in the town center. Moreover, the Doncaster officials stated that they are not the only ones promoting the idea of a Yorkshire Robin Hood. The nearby city of Wakefield, for example, has long claimed to be Robin Hood's birthplace, and features a Robin Hood museum. Of course, the debate about Robin Hood's origins may never be fully settled.

Because of their long life, fast switching times, and their ability to be seen in broad daylight due to their high output and focus, LEDs have been used in brake lights for cars' highmounted brake lights, trucks, and buses, and in turn signals for some time, but many vehicles now use LEDs for their rear light clusters. The use in brakes improves safety, due to a great reduction in the time needed to light fully, or faster rise time, up to 0.5 second faster[citation needed] than an incandescent bulb.
