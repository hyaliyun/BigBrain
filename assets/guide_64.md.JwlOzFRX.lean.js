Monitor the internal temperature until it reaches 160° F (71° C). Remove the skin and serve the chicken immediately.","completion":"\\"Properly Cooked Chicken: Preheat, Monitor, Remove Skin & Serve Immediately\\" To ensure that your chicken is cooked well and safe to eat, it is important to follow some essential steps. Firstly, preheat the oven or the skillet before adding the chicken to it. Preheating allows the heat to penetrate the chicken evenly, aiding in faster and more thorough cooking. Secondly, monitor the chicken's internal temperature until it reaches the recommended safe temperature of 160° F (71° C). Using a meat thermometer, measure the temp by inserting it at the thickest part of the chicken without touching the bone. Cooking to this temperature ensures that any bacteria present in raw chicken is destroyed, making it safe to eat. Thirdly, remove the skin from the cooked chicken before serving. Although many people love the crispy texture and flavor of chicken skin, it often contains extra calories and saturated fat. Removing the skin reduces the fat and calorie content of the meal while still getting the protein and nutrients from the meat. Lastly, serve the chicken immediately after cooking. When left to sit, cooked chicken can easily spoil and become unsafe to eat. Serving the chicken right after cooking also ensures that it remains at a safe temperature, reducing the risk of foodborne illnesses. In conclusion, by following the essential steps of preheating, monitoring internal temperature, removing the skin, and serving immediately, you can ensure that your cooked chicken is both safe and healthy to eat."},{"prompt":"Write a question about the following article: Coming off their bye week and still looking for their first win, the Dolphins went home for an AFC East duel with the Buffalo Bills.

To ensure a successful harvest, it is important to follow proper planting and care techniques. First, select a location with well-drained, nutrient-rich soil and full sun. Hazelnut bushes require plenty of sunlight to thrive, so choose a spot that receives at least six hours of direct sunlight each day. When planting, dig a hole that is twice the size of the root ball of each hazelnut bush. This will give the roots plenty of room to grow and establish themselves in the soil. Be sure to space the bushes out by at least 20 feet, as hazelnut bushes can grow quite large. After planting, it is important to care for the hazelnut bushes properly. Water regularly, especially during dry spells, and provide a layer of organic mulch around the bushes to retain moisture and suppress weeds. It can take 5-7 years for the hazelnut bushes to bear nuts, so be patient. When the time comes to harvest, the nuts will be enclosed in burrs. These burrs should be pulled apart to reveal the nuts inside. Once harvested, the hazelnuts should be dried on newspaper for 3-4 days to remove any excess moisture. They can then be enjoyed as a healthy and delicious snack, or used in baking and cooking.

The announcement was made public after the 29-year-old reached an agreement with the German club. Despite his international success, Metzelder has been plagued with injuries during his time with Real Madrid. He has only managed to play in a limited number of games over the past three seasons. However, Schalke believes that his experience and skill in the pitch will be a valuable addition to their team. Metzelder has previously played for Schalke's rivals, Borussia Dortmund, where he had a successful stint in the early 2000s. With this move to Schalke, he hopes to revive his career and help the club continue its push for the Bundesliga title. Schalke's sporting director, Christian Heidel, expressed his excitement about the acquisition, saying, \\"Metzelder is not only an experienced defender with international experience, but he is also a great person who fits perfectly into our team's profile\\". Fans of Schalke will be eagerly anticipating the upcoming season, as they look to break Bayern Munich's monopoly over the Bundesliga. With the addition of Metzelder, the team's chances of achieving this goal have certainly increased."},{"prompt":"Write an article based on this summary: Place a lamp in between a globe and a world map. Turn off all the lights in the room except for the lamp. Observe how the light shines on the globe and the map differently. Ask yourself whether the round globe or flat map seems more realistic.","completion":"In order to explore the question of which representation of the world seems more realistic - a round globe or a flat map - a simple experiment can be conducted. All that is required is a lamp, a globe, and a world map. Place the lamp in between the globe and map, and turn off all other lights in the room. Then, observe how the lamp's light shines on each object differently. The spherical surface of the globe allows for the light to be dispersed in all directions, creating a more realistic representation of how light would naturally fall on Earth. On the other hand, the flat surface of the map causes the light to shine more evenly, without the variation in brightness that would occur on a spherical object. Of course, the question of which representation is more realistic extends beyond the way in which light falls onto it. Ultimately, it comes down to the purpose for which the representation is being used. Maps, for example, are more practical for navigation and studying geography, as they allow for a more comprehensive view of a given area. Globes, on the other hand, are useful for conveying a sense of our planet's place in the universe, and can be used to explore larger concepts such as the relative positions of countries and continents. When it comes down to it, the debate between the globe and the map ultimately comes down to preference and utility. Each representation serves its own purposes, and both are necessary tools for understanding our world."},{"prompt":"What happens next? How to do a colorful smokey eye look Use warm metallic and browns for blue eyes. When it comes to choosing colored shadows for a smoky look on blue eyes, warm metallic and brown shades are usually the most flattering option. These shades are opposite blue on the color wheel, so they create a bold contrast with blue eyes that really make them pop. OPTIONS: You can purchase an emerald blue eyeshadow or colored shadow as well. If you're looking for a really intense smoky eye, go for neutral blue shades.

Tourism Secretary Jim Hagen chose Jett as the star of the state's Mount Rushmore float in this year's Macy's Thanksgiving parade, and South Dakota ranchers are not happy about it, the Rapid City Journal reports. Jett has appeared in PETA campaigns for vegetarianism, and that agenda ... does not represent South Dakota, which is a very agricultural state, says one rancher who also happens to be a state senator. PETA is obviously very antiag, he adds. They are very misinformed on the ag industry and the animal ag industry. The South Dakota Cattlemen's Association is also very concerned about Jett's role, the executive director says; the AP reports that the organization's president called it a huge blunder. But Hagen says Macy's actually selected Jett after the celebrities the state suggested were unavailable.

However, the exact numbers of each type of weapon used in the attack are not specified, making it difficult to provide a specific answer. It is important to understand the difference between artillery and anti-tank guns to understand why this disparity in numbers may exist. Artillery refers to large, heavy weapons that are often used to support infantry or soften up an enemy position before an assault. They are typically fired from a distance and can cause widespread damage over a large area. On the other hand, anti-tank guns are specifically designed to penetrate and disable armored vehicles, and are typically smaller and more mobile than artillery. Given these differences, it is not surprising that there were more artillery pieces than anti-tank guns in the initial attack. Artillery would have been needed to soften up the enemy's defenses, while anti-tank guns would have been used to counter any armored vehicles that the enemy had. Additionally, anti-tank guns are typically more expensive and difficult to manufacture, meaning that there may have been a limited number of them available. In the end, while we cannot provide exact numbers, it is safe to assume that there were significantly more artillery pieces than anti-tank guns in the initial attack. However, it is also important to note that the numbers and types of weapons used likely varied depending on the specific circumstances of the attack, and that other factors such as terrain and weather may have also played a role in determining which weapons were used."},{"prompt":"At the September 9, 2009 keynote presentation at the Apple Event, Phil Schiller announced total cumulative sales of iPods exceeded 220 million. a good answer to the question Approximately how many total iPods had been sold by late 2009?

Smith: Moratorium would effectively halt drilling for five years, not just six months. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"A federal judge has issued an injunction against the government's moratorium on oil drilling. The move came after concerns were raised about the safety records and economic impact of the halt on drilling. Eric Smith from the energy industry argued that the government did not properly consider these factors when imposing the moratorium. According to Smith, the judge also noted that an expert panel had not been consulted on the decision. The moratorium was initially supposed to be in place for six months, but Smith argued that it would effectively halt drilling for five years. The decision has been met with mixed reactions, with some hailing it as a victory for the energy industry, while others have expressed concerns about the safety implications of lifting the moratorium. The oil drilling industry is a major contributor to the economy, but it also carries significant risks. In recent years, there have been several high-profile oil spills that have caused significant damage to ecosystems and local communities.

The order includes more than 1,000 described species in about 153 genera. Despite the common names, they are neither true scorpions (order Scorpiones) nor true spiders (order Araneae). Much like a spider, the body of a solifugid has two tagmata: an opisthosoma (abdomen) behind the prosoma (that is, in effect, a combined head and thorax). At the front end, the prosoma bears two chelicerae that, in most species, are conspicuously large. The chelicerae serve as jaws and in many species also are used for stridulation.

But all in all, the movie is incredibly stupid, with a detective trying to track down a suspected serial killer, only to find out he may have committed one of the crimes. Then he finds himself haunted by a gorgeous Asian lady ghost, and has no idea why (and neither does the viewer). As other murders are committed, he becomes even more confused as the killers are easily found, and this ghost still haunts him for some reason. Not only is the plot completely stupid, the lady ghost is more funny than anything, especially when she suddenly flies across the city, like Wonder Woman.

While the FBI closed its inquiry into Tsarnaev shortly afterwards and stated that he did not pose a risk, the CIA request means that questions will surely be asked as to why he was not more closely monitored. While Reuters confirms Tsarnaev's name was added to the TIDE database, it differs in saying that it happened due to the 2011 FBI inquiry, rather than any action taken by the CIA.

However, Claudia’s parents refused to give up on their little girl and were determined to find a way to beat the disease. Through extensive research, Claudia’s parents discovered an experimental treatment option that they believed could save their daughter’s life.

The rally, attended by 400 Pegida supporters, was met by a 2,000-strong counter-protest organized by Respect MP George Galloway, who branded them \\"Nazis\\". Despite the insistence by the Pegida organisers that the protest would be peaceful, a number of men were left with bloodied faces and were seen being dragged to the ground by police officers.

In recent months, the group has attempted to establish itself in the UK.

Talk to people about it. Turn it into a strength. Change how others think. Denounce accusations as lies.","completion":"Forgiveness is an essential component of positive human interactions. However, while it is important to forgive, it is equally important to accept that people might not forget our past mistakes. Whether we have hurt someone or made a mistake that impacted others, it is natural for people to remember it, and it is our responsibility to acknowledge that. Instead of hiding and hoping that people forget, we can choose to talk to people about it. We can acknowledge our mistake or wrongdoing and express our remorse. By doing this, we can turn a negative interaction into a positive one. When we own up to our actions, people are more likely to forgive us, and we can start to rebuild trust. Moreover, we can learn to turn our past mistakes into strengths. Once we have owned up to our mistakes, we can reflect on why we made them in the first place. Perhaps we can use these learnings to become better people and prevent similar mistakes in the future. This way, we can take negativity and turn it into a positive learning experience. As we move forward, we can also try to change others' perceptions. People might hold negative opinions based on our past mistakes, but we can work to show them the person we are today. Through our positive actions and interactions, we can prove to people that we have grown and evolved. Finally, if someone accuses us of something that we didn't do, we can denounce their accusations as lies. It is important to stand up for ourselves and not let false accusations ruin our reputation. By standing our ground and defending our character, we can show others that we will not tolerate false accusations. In conclusion, when it comes to past mistakes, it is important to accept that people might not forget. However, by talking about it, turning it into a strength, changing others' perceptions, and denouncing false accusations, we can take control of our situation and move forward with positivity."},{"prompt":"Q: In what century was the Newer Orthography created?

About 200 energycapturing tiles harness player movements to power lights. The new pitch was launched by Brazilian football legend Pele. The technology could also apparently be used to power future cities. Similar tiles have been employed in airports, shopping centres and more but this is the first time they have been used on a football field.","completion":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, has now a high-tech football pitch that harnesses energy from player movements. The field, which was officially launched by Brazilian legend Pele, features around 200 energy-capturing tiles that convert the kinetic energy produced by players into electricity to power the field's lights. This innovative technology uses a piezoelectric system that generates an electrical charge when pressure is applied to certain materials, allowing the players' movements to be converted into a source of renewable energy. This is not the first time that energy-capturing tiles have been utilized for public spaces. Airports, shopping centres, and other public spaces have already recognized the potential of this technology to provide sustainable energy solutions. However, this is the first time that such tiles have been put to use in a football field. The possibility of generating energy from human movement brings up an innovative way to approach urban design and sustainability. As well as aiding in the development of sustainable energy sources, this technology can provide other benefits too. For instance, the football pitch stays illuminated even during blackouts or power outages, ensuring continued use for the sports community. The energy that the tiles capture can also be harnessed to power communities and even cities. Imagine harnessing the energy produced by a city to power itself. Innovations like these are an exciting example of how we can engage with sustainable ideologies to make a lasting impact on the planet. The energy-capturing tiles that take advantage of human motion are an excellent display of how the renewal of old technologies and practices can lead to new and innovative ideas. As more cities and communities look at ways to become sustainable, projects like this football pitch, which converts player movements into energy, become more and more relevant. A simple idea with tremendous potential for the future."},{"prompt":"Write the next sentence in the following story. A boy wearing glasses is seated at a table.

A device that is HS capable first connects as an FS device (D+ pulled high), but upon receiving a USB RESET (both D+ and D− driven LOW by host for 10 to 20 ms) it pulls the D− line high, known as chirp K. This indicates to the host that the device is high bandwidth. If the host/hub is also HS capable, it chirps (returns alternating J and K states on D− and D+ lines) letting the device know that the hub operates at high bandwidth. The device has to receive at least three sets of KJ chirps before it changes to high bandwidth terminations and begins high bandwidth signaling.

Observe closely, but don't interfere with, the second stage of labor. Be prepared to call in a veterinarian.","completion":"Foaling: When to Observe and Call a Veterinarian Foaling is a delicate process, and every horse owner should be aware of the signs that indicate the onset of labor. The first signs of foaling include restlessness, sweating, and frequent urination. When these signs are observed, horse owners must keep a close eye on their mares, but not interfere with the second stage of labor. This is when the actual foaling takes place, and it must not be interrupted unless there is an emergency. During the second stage of labor, mares may lie down on their sides and push, while the amniotic sac breaks, and the foal's legs and hooves become visible. This is a critical moment that requires owners to exercise patience and restraint, as the mare may take several hours to safely deliver the foal. However, owners must also be prepared to call a veterinarian if they notice any signs of distress in the mare or foal, such as prolonged contractions, a breached foal, or difficulty breathing. A veterinarian plays a crucial role in ensuring that the foaling process occurs smoothly and that both the mare and foal are healthy. If owners are not confident about foaling, they can hire an experienced foaling attendant to assist with the delivery. However, it is essential to note that owners must not attempt to assist with the foaling, as their interference may cause more harm than good. In conclusion, as a horse owner, it is crucial to be aware of the signs of foaling and to keep a close watch on your mare during the second stage of labor without interfering. Additionally, owners must be prepared to call a veterinarian or a foaling attendant immediately if they notice any signs of distress in the mare or foal. By being proactive and cautious, owners can ensure that their horses have a safe and healthy foaling experience."},{"prompt":"What is the difference between Windows and Linux for web hosting?

Noether's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason. Einstein argued that this is true for fundamental reasons, because the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the noncovariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, and others, and has become standard.

Some euphorbias have leafless, rounded bodies adapted to water conservation similar to those of globular cacti, but characters such as the structure of their flowers make it clear that the two groups are not closely related. The cladistic method takes a systematic approach to characters, distinguishing between those that carry no information about shared evolutionary history – such as those evolved separately in different groups (homoplasies) or those left over from ancestors (plesiomorphies) – and derived characters, which have been passed down from innovations in a shared ancestor (apomorphies). Only derived characters, such as the spineproducing areoles of cacti, provide evidence for descent from a common ancestor.

This process involves a thorough interview process that emphasizes the importance of qualifications such as a valid driver's license, a clean driving record, and relevant experience.

This step involves creating a recognizable and professional image for the company that reflects a high level of orderliness and structure. Uniforms should be comfortable, practical, and designed to withstand the rigors of daily work, such as easy maintenance and washing. By providing uniforms, employees will have a sense of ownership and pride for their work, making them more committed to delivering exceptional service. Clear rules and guidelines for staff members are essential in creating a respectful work environment. This aspect involves setting clear expectations that are well-communicated to all employees, outlining their responsibilities and what is expected of them. Rules could range from punctuality, dress code, vehicle maintenance, and standards of conduct. Making rules clear from the outset provides a structure that allows for smooth operations and excellent customer experiences. Lastly, good employment practices are essential in creating and maintaining a conducive working environment. Consistently recognizing good work, providing opportunities for growth, and fostering a sense of belonging through inclusive activities or training can motivate employees to provide excellent services. Additionally, providing incentives such as healthcare, retirement benefits, or vacation days can improve the overall quality of life for employees. In conclusion, proper management of a transportation service requires the application of several essential components. These include the hiring process for drivers, provision of uniforms, establishment of clear rules and regulations, and the implementation of good employment practices. By putting these elements into practice, transportation services can improve overall quality, safety, and professionalism, leaving customers feeling satisfied and confident in their service provider."},{"prompt":"The Tree<br>Alex stood at the base of the tree and looked up into the branches.

The most recent United States Census conducted in 2020 reported that Spanish was the second most commonly spoken language in the country with over 41 million speakers. German, on the other hand, was listed as the eighth most commonly spoken language with just over 1 million speakers. However, if we consider language statistics from different countries or regions, the answer may change. For example, in Germany, German is obviously the most common spoken language, whereas Spanish is not even in the top 10. Similarly, in many Latin American countries, Spanish is the dominant language, and German is not widely spoken. It's important to note that language statistics can vary depending on the source and methodology of the census or survey. Additionally, some individuals may speak more than one language, making it challenging to determine a clear distinction between first and second languages. In conclusion, if we are referring to the United States Census, Spanish is the first language spoken from the census that has more speakers than German.

Collect larger logs for fuel. Build a teepee structure with the tinder and kindling. Create a fire plough to ignite the kindling and start the fire. Use a fire to keep warm, cook your food, and purify your water.","completion":"Starting a fire can be a critical skill for anyone who enjoys outdoor activities such as camping or hiking. With just a few essential tools and materials, building a fire can be a straightforward and rewarding experience. Here's how to create a fire that provides warmth, cooks food, and purifies water: 1. Find tinder: Tinder is the starting material for a fire. Look around for small, dry materials such as leaves, grass, or shredded bark to use as tinder. Ensure that it's as dry as possible to catch the flame easily. 2. Gather kindling: Collect small twigs, dry branches, and other materials to use as kindling. The kindling needs to be dry and thin enough to catch fire quickly but not so thick that it won't ignite. 3. Collect fuel: Larger logs and branches work best as fuel for your fire. Look for dry wood to prevent having to deal with a lot of smoke while you nurture the flame. Avoid using wood prone to putting off sap or that which is wet due to the recent rain. 4. Build a teepee structure: Building a teepee structure is the simplest and most effective way of building a fire. Place the tinder in the center of the fire pit and lean the kindling wood around it loosely in a cone shape, leaving spaces for air to flow through regularly. 5. Create a fire plow: If you don't have matches, creating a fire plow is an excellent alternative. Cut a groove in a flat piece of wood, and rub a stick back and forth in the groove to create friction. This friction will cause heat and eventually a spark, igniting the tinder. 6. Use fire to keep warm: With your fire finally lit, you can use it to keep warm in cold weather conditions. Position yourself close enough to the fire to feel its warmth, but not too close to preserve your clothes and skin. 7. Cook your food: A fire is also suitable for cooking your food. Use your fuel wood as a flame if you have a grill or platter, or craft an improvised cooking surface using available materials like rock surfaces. 8. Purify your water: Finally, use your fire to purify your water. Boiling your water over a fire for about 15 minutes is one of the most effective ways to kill any bacteria, making it ready for consumption. Having the skill to start a fire in the wild is an essential survival skill. By following the steps provided above, you will be able to build a fire and even use it for multiple purposes. Whether it's during camping, hiking, or any other outdoor activity, a fire can keep you warm, cook your food, and purify your water."},{"prompt":"Question: How many South Korean National Assemblyman pledged their allegiance to Seoul?

Whether you're trying to impress a potential employer, build relationships with colleagues, or simply make a good first impression, there are certain things you can do to improve your image. First of all, consider spending time with people who have a positive impact on your image. Surrounding yourself with successful, confident, and well-respected individuals can help boost your own reputation. You can learn a lot from the way they conduct themselves and the way they communicate with others. Dressing to impress is another key factor to improving your image. This doesn't necessarily mean wearing expensive clothes, but rather dressing appropriately for the occasion and ensuring that you look put together. Take the time to groom yourself, style your hair, and choose clothes that flatter your shape and make you feel confident. Another way to leave a lasting impression is to do something that people will remember. This could range from offering a unique perspective in a meeting, to performing a random act of kindness for someone, to simply being consistently reliable and dependable. Whatever it is, make sure it sets you apart from the crowd. While trying to make a good impression, it's also important to stay under control. Avoid excessive drinking or overindulging in food, as this can lead to embarrassing behavior or poor decision-making. Instead, be present in the moment and ensure that you're representing yourself in the best possible light. Knowing your audience is also crucial for improving your image. Consider who you are interacting with and adjust your behavior accordingly. Be mindful of cultural differences that may impact how others perceive you, and try to tailor your communication style to their preferences. Aside from these external factors, basic hygiene is also essential. Observe good personal hygiene habits such as showering, brushing your teeth, and wearing clean clothes to ensure that you're presenting yourself in a positive light. Most importantly, like yourself! Confidence is key when it comes to improving your image. Believe in yourself, your abilities and your worth. Remember to enjoy what you are doing and this will be apparent to those around you. Finally, don't forget to use your sense of humor. Being able to laugh at yourself and tell a good joke can help break down barriers and form connections with others. Just be sure to use good judgment and appropriate humor in different situations. In summary, improving your image involves a combination of factors, such as spending time with positive influences, dressing well, doing something memorable, staying in control, knowing your audience, practicing good hygiene, liking yourself, and using humor. These are simple steps that you can take to become a more confident and memorable person, leaving a positive impression on those you encounter."},{"prompt":"ere is a dialogue: Jenny: Are you protesting with the crowds in Budapest?

New tables were launched by Transport Minister Stephen Hammond.","completion":"According to new tables launched by Transport Minister Stephen Hammond, rural Herefordshire is the deadliest place in the UK to drive. The tables reflect the number of fatal road accidents per million vehicle miles travelled in each local authority area. Other rural areas that made the top ten list of deadliest places to drive include Powys, the Isle of Anglesey, Cumbria, and Devon. One reason for this is that rural roads are often narrow and winding, with many blind corners and hidden dips. These roads can be particularly treacherous during bad weather, with ice, snow, and flooding making driving even more challenging. However, it's not just the roads themselves that are a problem. Rural areas often have poorer transport links, which can make it harder for emergency services to reach the scene of an accident quickly. This means that injured drivers and passengers may have to wait longer for medical treatment, which can increase the risk of serious injury or death. There are a number of things that can be done to reduce the risk of accidents on rural roads. For example, local authorities can invest in road safety initiatives, such as installing speed cameras, improving road markings, and providing training for drivers. They can also work to improve public transport links, which could encourage more people to leave their cars at home. In addition, individual drivers can take steps to improve their own safety on the road. This includes making sure that their vehicle is well-maintained, driving at an appropriate speed, and avoiding distractions such as using a mobile phone while driving. Overall, the new tables highlighting the deadliest places to drive in the UK should serve as a wake-up call for both local authorities and individual drivers. By working together, we can help to reduce the number of fatal accidents that occur on our roads, particularly in rural areas where the risks are often highest."},{"prompt":"What are the most important words in the following sentence: a student works with the help of his teacher at a computer","completion":"student, works, help, teacher, computer."},{"prompt":"Write the next sentence in the following story.
