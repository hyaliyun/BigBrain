Article: School education is very important and useful. The students both learn knowledge and get educated. Yet, no one can learn everything from school. Scientists, such as Edison, Newton, Galileo and Einstein, didn't learn everything from school. They learnt a lot of knowledge outside school or practiced a lot themselves. A teacher, though he knows a lot, can't teach his students everything. The teacher's job is to teach his students how to learn, how to read and how to think. A good teacher with rich experience in teaching can teach his students the methods (=ways) of study. Through these methods students are able to learn and get a lot of things by themselves. Usually it's very easy for students to memorize some knowledge, but it is difficult to use it to solve problems. If a teacher really teaches students the ability of how to use knowledge, it means the teacher has learned lots of knowledge by himself(or herself). The success in learning shows he or she knows how how how to study. (,10) Question: Which of the following is right? Answer","completion":"The answer is not provided.

These areas, called growth plates , allow the bones to grow longer as the child grows. By the time the child reaches an age of about 18 to 25 years, all of the cartilage in the growth plate has been replaced by bone. This stops the bone from growing any longer. Even though bones stop growing in length in early adulthood, they can continue to increase in thickness throughout life. This thickening occurs in response to strain from increased muscle activity and from weightlifting exercises. I am facing a new situation today: Two brothers, Tom, aged 26, and Paul, aged 16 were into sports. Tom started weightlifting to gain more muscle mass. Three years later he was 2025 lbs. heavier. Paul started track and field, he liked running. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which brother had all of the cartilage in the growth plate replaced by bone?","completion":"Tom had all of the cartilage in the growth plate replaced by bone, as he was already 26 years old and past the age at which cartilage is fully converted to bone.

Question: What contradicts the Planck Constant's main claim?

For example, green light with a wavelength of 555 nanometres (the approximate wavelength to which human eyes are most sensitive) has a frequency of 7014540000000000000♠540 THz (7014540000000000000♠540×1012 Hz). Each photon has an energy E = hf = 6981358000000000000♠3.58×10−19 J. That is a very small amount of energy in terms of everyday experience, but everyday experience is not concerned with individual photons any more than with individual atoms or molecules. An amount of light compatible with everyday experience is the energy of one mole of photons; its energy can be computed by multiplying the photon energy by the Avogadro constant, NA ≈ 7023602200000000000♠6.022×1023 mol−1. The result is that green light of wavelength 555 nm has an energy of 7005216000000000000♠216 kJ/mol, a typical energy of everyday life.","completion":"The provided context does not contain any information that contradicts the main claim of the Planck Constant."},{"prompt":"Will Vodery (October 8, 1885 November 18, 1951) was an AfricanAmerican composer, conductor, orchestrator, and arranger, and one of the few black Americans of his time to make a name for himself as a composer on Broadway, working largely for Florenz Ziegfeld.

It’s a source of identity and pride, and has played a pivotal role in shaping the country’s history. On International Mother Language Day, which is celebrated on February 21st, Bangladesh remembers its language heroes - the brave individuals who fought for their right to speak their mother tongue, Bangla. In 1952, West Pakistan, which was then part of a unified Pakistan, declared Urdu as the only official language of the country. This move angered Bengali nationalists, who saw it as an attempt to suppress their culture and identity. Protests erupted across East Pakistan, and on February 21, 1952, students and activists gathered to demand recognition for their mother tongue. The police responded with force, and several protesters were killed. The tragic events of that day sparked a movement that eventually led to the recognition of Bangla as an official language of Pakistan in 1956, and as the official language of Bangladesh after its independence in 1971. Every year, Bangladesh honors the language heroes who sacrificed their lives for their language. The most iconic monument to their memory is the Shaheed Minar, a towering structure made of red bricks and adorned with Bengali calligraphy. On International Mother Language Day, thousands of people come to the Shaheed Minar to pay their respects and lay wreaths in honor of the fallen heroes. The day is also marked by cultural events, including poetry readings and musical performances, that celebrate the richness and diversity of Bengali language and culture. Despite the progress that has been made, the struggle for language rights in Bangladesh is far from over. There are still many minority languages that are at risk of being lost forever, and many people who are denied the opportunity to learn and speak in their mother tongue. Honoring the language heroes of the past is therefore not just a way to remember their sacrifices, but also a reminder of the ongoing struggle to protect and promote linguistic diversity and cultural rights for all."},{"prompt":"Fred covered his eyes with his hands , because the wind was blowing sand around.

Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the wellestablished hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield. Paragraph: Ted had two farmlands. Hill land had good mycorrhizal colonization because ted used cover crops, while Meadow land had fewer AM fungi present in the soil.

Noether's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason. Einstein argued that this is true for fundamental reasons, because the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the noncovariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field.

As consumers, they have various roles in food chains and webs. Some are predators. They prey upon other singlecelled organisms, such as bacteria. In fact, protozoa predators keep many bacterial populations in check. Other protozoa are herbivores. They graze on algae. Still others are decomposers. They consume dead organic matter. There are also parasitic protozoa that live in or on living hosts. For example, the protozoan that causes malaria lives inside a human host. For their part, protozoa are important food sources for many larger organisms, including insects and worms. Paragraph: Students learned about protozoa in school this week.

Hearing that, king of Sicily called Archimedes and his fellow scientist Ptolemy to come up with great inventions. Archimedes, as everyone expected, came up with a great machine. But Ptolemy couldn't do much in such a limited time. So, his device was not a machine.

Contrary to popular belief, machines do not increase the amount of work that is done. They just change how the work is done. So if a machine increases the force applied, it must apply the force over a shorter distance.

What most people do not know about the tails is that they always point away from the Sun rather than trailing behind the comet (like the tail of Bo Peep’s sheep). Comet tails are composed of gases and dust evaporated from the body of the comet and ionized gas. The dust particles recoil away from the Sun when photons scatter from them. Evidently, photons carry momentum in the direction of their motion (away from the Sun), and some of this momentum is transferred to dust particles in collisions. Gas atoms and molecules in the blue tail are most affected by other particles of radiation, such as protons and electrons emanating from the Sun, rather than by the momentum of photons. Q: Why do comet tails always point away from the sun instead of trailing behind the comet?

It has many important functions. The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air.

The theoretical principle behind production of mechanical force by the interactions of an electric current and a magnetic field, Ampère's force law, was discovered later by AndréMarie Ampère in 1820. The conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy by electromagnetic means was demonstrated by the British scientist Michael Faraday in 1821. A freehanging wire was dipped into a pool of mercury, on which a permanent magnet (PM) was placed. When a current was passed through the wire, the wire rotated around the magnet, showing that the current gave rise to a close circular magnetic field around the wire. This motor is often demonstrated in physics experiments, brine substituting for toxic mercury. Though Barlow's wheel was an early refinement to this Faraday demonstration, these and similar homopolar motors were to remain unsuited to practical application until late in the century.","completion":"The history and development of electric motors."},{"prompt":"Dan is in his physics lab.

Hint: Another thing we can see in this animation is that particles are constantly colliding with one another. One assumption that we make when talking about collisions between gas particles is that they are completely elastic collisions. In an elastic collision , momentum is conserved, which means that none of the kinetic energy of the colliding particles is lost in some other form (such as the emission of light). This makes sense, because if energy were lost in collisions, the speeds of the particles would gradually decrease over time, and eventually everything would condense down into a solid form.","completion":"Momentum would be conserved in sample A."},{"prompt":"Given that Pfizer has reached a broad agreement to pay millions of dollars to Nigeria's Kano state to settle a criminal case alleging that the drug company illegally tested an experimental drug on gravely ill children during a 1996 meningitis epidemic.

Their native areas range from the southeast of Colorado to Virginia and Florida. In nature, they inhabit areas with a source of still, warm water, such as ponds, lakes, swamps, creeks, streams, or slowflowing rivers. They live in areas of calm water where they are able to leave the water easily by climbing onto rocks or tree trunks so they can warm up in the sun. Individuals are often found sunbathing in a group or even on top of each other. They also require abundant aquatic plants, as these are the adults' main food, although they are omnivores.

Question: Two equally and oppositely charged poles at a set distance from one another is called a? Context: Instead, it is often desired to have an antenna whose impedance does not vary so greatly over a certain bandwidth. It turns out that the amount of reactance seen at the terminals of a resonant antenna when the frequency is shifted, say, by 5%, depends very much on the diameter of the conductor used. A long thin wire used as a halfwave dipole (or quarter wave monopole) will have a reactance significantly greater than the resistive impedance it has at resonance, leading to a poor match and generally unacceptable performance. Making the element using a tube of a diameter perhaps 1/50 of its length, however, results in a reactance at this altered frequency which is not so great, and a much less serious mismatch which will only modestly damage the antenna's net performance. Thus rather thick tubes are typically used for the solid elements of such antennas, including YagiUda arrays.","completion":"The answer to the question is not provided in the context."},{"prompt":"De Sica is becoming one of my favorite directors, but this one was a hitandmiss for me.

Context: Second, Democrats have always elevated their minority floor leader to the speakership upon reclaiming majority status. Republicans have not always followed this leadership succession pattern. In 1919, for instance, Republicans bypassed James R. Mann, RIL, who had been minority leader for eight years, and elected Frederick Gillett, RMA, to be Speaker. Mann had angered many Republicans by objecting to their private bills on the floor; also he was a protégé of autocratic Speaker Joseph Cannon, RIL (1903–1911), and many Members suspected that he would try to recentralize power in his hands if elected Speaker. More recently, although Robert H. Michel was the Minority Leader in 1994 when the Republicans regained control of the House in the 1994 midterm elections, he had already announced his retirement and had little or no involvement in the campaign, including the Contract with America which was unveiled six weeks before voting day.

Metafiction genre occurs when a character within a literary work acknowledges the reality that they are in fact a fictitious being. The use of the fourth wall in literature can be traced back as far as The Canterbury Tales and Don Quixote. However, it was popularized in the early 20 century during the PostModern literary movement. Artists like Virginia Woolf in To the Lighthouse and Kurt Vonnegut in Breakfast of Champions used the genre to question the accepted knowledge and sources of the culture. The use of metafiction or breaking the fourth wall in literature varies from that on stage in that the experience is not communal but personal to the reader and develops a selfconsciousness within the character/reader relationship that works to build trust and expand thought.

WikiLeaks has already over a million documents being prepared to be released, documents that affect every country in the world. Every country in this world, said Assange. Assange railed against his usual enemies, in particular the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. In 2013, we continue to stand up to bullies, he said. True democracy is not the White House. True democracy is not Canberra. True democracy is the resistance of people, armed with the truth, against lies, from Tahrir to right here in London. He also called the media corrupt and criticized the press for war crimes. You can read Assange's full speech over at WikiLeaks.","completion":"Julian Assange, the founder of the infamous whistleblowing organization WikiLeaks, made his second public appearance since taking refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London six months ago. He made a 12-minute-long speech from an embassy balcony promising to release a staggering one million documents in 2013. The documents allegedly contain sensitive information that affects every country in the world. Assange took the opportunity to criticize the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, whom he calls his usual enemies. \\"In 2013, we continue to stand up to bullies,\\" he said. \\"True democracy is not the White House. True democracy is not Canberra. True democracy is the resistance of people, armed with the truth, against lies, from Tahrir to right here in London.\\" Assange talked about his mission to bring the truth to light, saying, \\"We have called out the world's most powerful people: the generals, the politicians, the spies, and the world's top intelligence agencies. But WikiLeaks is more than just about co-publishing, it's about systematising truth.\\" The whistleblower also criticized the media, referring to them as \\"corrupt.\\" He accused them of being accomplices of war crimes and not challenging power but simply portraying it as something to be accepted. He warned, \\"The corruption of the press, since this century started, has been an extraordinary phenomenon. It's not that wars shouldn't be covered, but it shouldn't be celebrated.\\" Assange's speech was well received by members of the public who had gathered outside the embassy. His supporters lauded his efforts to uncover corruption and praised his contributions towards creating a more transparent society. In conclusion, Julian Assange's speech was a strong message of defiance to his critics and a call to action to uphold the truth. His promise to release one million documents in 2013 may further embarrass governments and other organizations already targeted by WikiLeaks. However, the actions of WikiLeaks remain controversial, with many questioning the ethics of releasing sensitive information without considering the consequences."},{"prompt":"John is an amateur astronomer.

The pope appointed their leader, Willibrordus, bishop of the Frisians. The tenure of Willibrordus is generally considered to be the beginning of the Bishopric of Utrecht. In 723, the Frankish leader Charles Martel bestowed the fortress in Utrecht and the surrounding lands as the base of the bishops. From then on Utrecht became one of the most influential seats of power for the Roman Catholic Church in the Netherlands. The archbishops of Utrecht were based at the uneasy northern border of the Carolingian Empire. In addition, the city of Utrecht had competition from the nearby trading centre Dorestad. After the fall of Dorestad around 850, Utrecht became one of the most important cities in the Netherlands. The importance of Utrecht as a centre of Christianity is illustrated by the election of the Utrechtborn Adriaan Florenszoon Boeyens as pope in 1522 (the last nonItalian pope before John Paul II)..

He had to determine the different effects these two cases were causing. In case B would less or more prolactin be released than in case A? Hint: Some processes in the body are regulated by positive feedback. Positive feedback is when a response to an event increases the likelihood of the event to continue. An example of positive feedback is milk production in nursing mothers. As the baby drinks her mother's milk, the hormone prolactin, a chemical signal, is released. The more the baby suckles, the more prolactin is released, which causes more milk to be produced. Other examples of positive feedback include contractions during childbirth. When constrictions in the uterus push a baby into the birth canal, additional contractions occur.","completion":"In case A, more prolactin would be released compared to case B because the baby is continuously suckling, which stimulates more milk production that is regulated by positive feedback.

One feature or the other may be considered redundant, and some phonemic analyses prefer to treat it as an opposition of tenseness. However, even if not considered part of the phonemic opposition, the long/tense vowels are still realised as phonetically longer than their short counterparts. The changes in vowel quality are also not always the same in all dialects, and in some there may be little difference at all, with length remaining the primary distinguishing feature. And while it is true that older words always pair vowel length with a change in vowel quality, new loanwords have reintroduced phonemic oppositions of length.

In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease.

The refractive index measures the phase velocity of light, which does not carry information. The phase velocity is the speed at which the crests of the wave move and can be faster than the speed of light in vacuum, and thereby give a refractive index below 1. This can occur close to resonance frequencies, for absorbing media, in plasmas, and for Xrays. In the Xray regime the refractive indices are lower than but very close to 1 (exceptions close to some resonance frequencies). As an example, water has a refractive index of 6999999999740000000♠0.99999974 = 1 − 6993260000000000000♠2.6×10 for Xray radiation at a photon energy of 6985480652946099999♠30 keV (0.04 nm wavelength).

He had the good opportunity to see various tidal conditions. First he saw the spring tide, which he noted as case A. About a week later he saw the neap tide. He noted that as case B. Rob got curious about the science behind various tidal conditions. Which case would see stronger tidal currents, case A or case B? Hint: When the Moon is at first quarter or third quarter, the Sun and Moon are separated by 90° when viewed from the Earth, and the solar tidal force partially cancels the Moon's tidal force. At these points in the lunar cycle, the tide's range is at its minimum; this is called the neap tide, or neaps. Neap is an AngloSaxon word meaning without the power, as in forðganges nip (forthgoing withoutthepower).Spring tides result in high waters that are higher than average, low waters that are lower than average, 'slack water' time that is shorter than average, and stronger tidal currents than average. Neaps result in less extreme tidal conditions. There is about a sevenday interval between springs and neaps.","completion":"Case A (spring tide) would have stronger tidal currents than case B (neap tide)."},{"prompt":"Answer the question depending on the context. Context: Both the vertical and dipole antennas are simple in construction and relatively inexpensive. The dipole antenna, which is the basis for most antenna designs, is a balanced component, with equal but opposite voltages and currents applied at its two terminals through a balanced transmission line (or to a coaxial transmission line through a socalled balun). The vertical antenna, on the other hand, is a monopole antenna. It is typically connected to the inner conductor of a coaxial transmission line (or a matching network); the shield of the transmission line is connected to ground. In this way, the ground (or any large conductive surface) plays the role of the second conductor of a dipole, thereby forming a complete circuit. Since monopole antennas rely on a conductive ground, a socalled grounding structure may be employed to provide a better ground contact to the earth or which itself acts as a ground plane to perform that function regardless of (or in absence of) an actual contact with the earth.; Question: What is used to close the circuit of a dipole antenna?; Answer","completion":"A balanced transmission line or a coaxial transmission line through a balun is used to close the circuit of a dipole antenna."},{"prompt":"Plants also detect the daily cycle of light and darkness.

Dormant is when a plant suspends its growth. It does this in order to survive. Shorter days signal the coming of winter. Winter in most areas means extreme cold. It is also very dry in the winter months. As winter approaches, some plants respond by their leaves changing color. After the change in color, they fall off. This dormancy period helps trees.

It's more like a home video shot with very minimal lighting and horrid acting. Not only that the storyline and script was wretched. I don't know why this movie was made. I have seen a lot of flicks in my time and the ones I really hate are movies that make me angry. This one made my blood boil. The situations were inane at best. If I made a movie like this it would have been a short. Really because those backwood idjits wouldn't have been in the picture.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the cover on the D.V.D. I am an avid watcher of bad cinema. But this movie is virtually unwatchable. I don't mind movies being shot on D.V. but if you're going to do that make the movie enjoyable, not some tired retread of superior horror films (sans Wrong Turn).<br /><br />I have to not recommend this waste of disk.

Context: If current trends continue, missiles will replace gun systems completely in first line service.[citation needed] Guns are being increasingly pushed into specialist roles, such as the Dutch Goalkeeper CIWS, which uses the GAU8 Avenger 30 mm sevenbarrel Gatling gun for last ditch antimissile and antiaircraft defence. Even this formerly frontline weapon is currently being replaced by new missile systems, such as the RIM116 Rolling Airframe Missile, which is smaller, faster, and allows for midflight course correction (guidance) to ensure a hit. To bridge the gap between guns and missiles, Russia in particular produces the Kashtan CIWS, which uses both guns and missiles for final defence. Two sixbarrelled 30 mm Gsh630 Gatling guns and 9M311 surfacetoair missiles provide for its defensive capabilities.

Although normally associated with action flicks that incorporate martial arts, this film , because it was a western, enabled him to display that he is a far more capable actor than certain formula story lines have allowed.<br /><br />The major problem, of course, is that the film does not allow any solid character development.

Which person's Geiger count has more current running through it? Robert and Thomas are visiting an abandoned amusement park in Russia that is rumored to emit radiation due to the materials used in the rides. Robert visits the Ferris wheel and his Geiger counter clicks slowly. Thomas visits the merry go round and his Geiger counter begins to click rapidly. Hint: One reason radiation is dangerous is that it can’t be detected with the senses. You normally can’t see it, smell it, hear it, or feel it. Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters that can detect radiation. A Geiger counter, like the one in Figure below , has a tube that contains atoms of a gas. If radiation enters the tube, it turns gas atoms to ions that carry electric current. The current causes the Geiger counter to click. The faster the clicks occur, the higher the level of radiation. You can see a video about the Geiger counter and how it was invented at the URL below.","completion":"Thomas's Geiger count has more current running through it."},{"prompt":"By Ray Massey PUBLISHED: 10:21 EST, 23 July 2013 | UPDATED: 03:35 EST, 24 July 2013 Bentley today announced more than 1,000 new jobs as part of a major £800million investment boost for the UK that will see a new £150,000 luxury 4X4 built in Britain rather than rival Bratislava.
