However, without specific details about the network configuration and setup, it is difficult to provide an exact reason for the behavior you have described."},{"prompt":"But I can connect with 2606:4700:4700::1111","completion":"If you are able to connect to the IPv6 address 2606:4700:4700::1111, which belongs to Cloudflare's public DNS resolver, it suggests that your IPv6 connectivity is working correctly. However, this does not necessarily imply that Google is blocking 6to4 traffic to ipv6.google.com. There could be several reasons why you are experiencing difficulties specifically with accessing ipv6.google.com via 6to4. It's possible that Google has implemented certain configurations or restrictions for this specific domain or that there are network issues between your 6to4 relay and Google's infrastructure. To further investigate the issue, you may consider performing network diagnostics, such as traceroutes or packet captures, to identify where the connection is being interrupted. Additionally, reaching out to Google support or your network administrator might be helpful in understanding any specific limitations or configurations on their side."},{"prompt":"In the end I just decided to use tunnels from tunnelbroker.net","completion":"That's a valid approach! Tunnelbroker.net offers IPv6 tunneling services that can help you establish connectivity to IPv6 networks. By creating a tunnel through tunnelbroker.net, you can bypass any potential issues related to 6to4 and directly access IPv6 resources.

Deploying your VPN to access the internet and bypass censorship is a common approach in regions where internet restrictions are in place. By running your own VPN, you can create an encrypted connection between your device and a server outside of your country, allowing you to access blocked websites and services. Additionally, configuring your VPN to support IPv6 will provide you with IPv6 connectivity and enable access to IPv6 websites and resources. Using your VPN to access the internet ensures that your online activities are protected, secure, and shielded from censorship. It encrypts your internet traffic, making it difficult for third parties to monitor or restrict your online behavior. However, it's worth noting that bypassing internet censorship measures may be against local regulations or laws in certain jurisdictions. It's important to be aware of the legal implications and potential consequences of using VPNs to circumvent censorship in your country. If you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the setup or usage of your VPN, I'd be happy to help provide guidance and support."},{"prompt":"I consider IPv6 as a nice bonus","completion":"I see! While IPv6 is indeed a bonus in your situation, it can provide several advantages beyond simply bypassing censorship. IPv6 offers a larger address space, improved network efficiency, and enhanced security features compared to IPv4. Some of the benefits of IPv6 include: 1. Increased address space: IPv6 provides a significantly larger address space than IPv4, allowing for the allocation of unique IP addresses to a larger number of devices. This is particularly valuable as the number of connected devices continues to grow. 2. Improved network efficiency: IPv6 introduces more efficient routing protocols, reducing the complexity of routing tables and improving network performance. It also eliminates the need for network address translation (NAT), simplifying network configuration. 3. Enhanced security: IPv6 includes built-in security features, such as IPsec, which provides encryption and authentication for network connections. This can help protect your data and enhance the overall security of your internet communications. 4. Future-proofing: As IPv4 addresses become increasingly scarce, adopting IPv6 ensures that your network is prepared for the future. IPv6 is the long-term solution for the growth of the internet and is being widely adopted worldwide. While your primary goal may be to bypass internet censorship using your VPN, having access to IPv6 through your VPN brings additional benefits and ensures compatibility with IPv6-enabled websites and services. If you have any further questions about IPv6, VPN setup, or any other related topic, feel free to ask!"},{"prompt":"I would write in legislation that providers are required to provide at least a /64 IPv6 subnet, with the exception of mobile providers, which will be required to provide 1 IP address per device","completion":"Proposing legislation to require internet service providers (ISPs) to provide a minimum /64 IPv6 subnet to their customers, excluding mobile providers who would be obligated to offer one IP address per device, can be a significant step toward promoting IPv6 adoption and ensuring sufficient address availability.

This interaction causes a shift in the wavelength of the scattered light, resulting in the Raman scattering effect. In most cases, the majority of the scattered light is due to a different phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. Rayleigh scattering occurs when light interacts with the electronic modes of molecules in a sample, causing no change in wavelength. This type of scattering is much more common and contributes to the overwhelming majority of the scattered light. Due to the nature of Raman scattering, which requires specific conditions and interactions to occur, it only accounts for a tiny fraction of the total scattered light. On average, Raman scattering contributes to only about one millionth (1/1,000,000) of the total scattered light."},{"prompt":"Due to the nature of Raman scattering, it requires specific conditions and interactions to occur, and therefore accounts for only about one millionth (1/1,000,000) of the total amount of scattered light. This makes Raman scattering weak and is a key factor hindering its further development","completion":"That's correct. The weak intensity of Raman scattering compared to other scattering phenomena such as Rayleigh scattering limits its practical applications and poses challenges for its further development. The low intensity of Raman scattering signals makes it difficult to detect and analyze, requiring sensitive instruments and techniques. This limitation has led to the development of various enhancement methods to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, such as surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and resonance Raman scattering. Despite its weakness, Raman scattering offers unique advantages in terms of providing detailed molecular information about the sample. It can reveal vibrational and rotational modes, chemical structures, and molecular dynamics, which are valuable for many scientific and analytical applications, such as materials science, chemistry, biology, and pharmaceuticals. Researchers continue to explore new ways to enhance Raman scattering signals and develop novel techniques to overcome its limitations, expanding its potential for various fields of study."},{"prompt":"The highly sensitive and accurate bioprobes based on ZnS/Ti3C2Tx MXene composites were successfully developed for the detection of GFAP. Two-dimensional material of MXene was used for the first time to enhance the MRRS signal of semiconductors. The constructed enhanced MRRS system has an enhancement factor of 1.5×107 and a low detection limit of 104.4 ag mL-1 for GFAP detection. This enhanced MRRS technique holds great promise for biomedical research.","completion":"That sounds like an interesting development in the field of Raman spectroscopy. The use of ZnS/Ti3C2Tx MXene composites as bioprobes and the enhancement of multimode resonant Raman scattering (MRRS) signal using two-dimensional MXene material is a novel approach. The reported enhancement factor of 1.5×107 and low detection limit of 104.4 ag mL-1 for the detection of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) indicate the high sensitivity and accuracy achieved by this technique. The successful development of these highly sensitive and accurate bioprobes could greatly benefit biomedical research, particularly in the field of molecular diagnostics. GFAP is an important biomarker associated with various diseases and conditions, including neurological disorders and traumatic brain injury. Having a reliable and sensitive detection method for GFAP could potentially aid in early diagnosis, disease monitoring, and prognosis evaluation. It's worth noting that the successful utilization of MXene as a promoter for enhancing the MRRS signal of semiconductors opens up new possibilities for further advancements in Raman spectroscopy and its applications. Continued research and development in this area could lead to even more sensitive, accurate, and versatile Raman-based techniques for various biomedical, chemical, and materials science applications."},{"prompt":"您好，请您扮演我的妈妈","completion":"好的，请问有什么我可以帮助您的吗？"},{"prompt":"我的妈妈每晚都会跟我讲关于“降低中国生育成本”的话题，她每次都会提出三个目前存在的问题，然后对着我分析这些问题，然后她会把她想到的解决方法告诉我。","completion":"好的，我可以帮你扮演你的妈妈来讨论这个话题。请问你母亲通常提到哪些关于降低中国生育成本的问题呢？"},{"prompt":"163邮箱如何登陆","completion":"要登录163邮箱，可以按照以下步骤操作： 1. 打开任意浏览器，在地址栏中输入“mail.163.com”，进入网易邮箱登录界面。 2. 在邮箱登录界面上，输入你的163邮箱账号。账号一般为你的完整邮箱地址，<PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS>。 3. 在密码栏中输入你的邮箱密码。请确保密码输入正确，因为密码区分大小写。 4. 勾选“保持登录状态”选项，如果你希望在下一次登录时保持登录状态。 5. 最后，点击“登录”按钮完成登录。 如果你输入的账号和密码正确，就可以成功登录到你的163邮箱账号了。"},{"prompt":"<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\"/> <title>Multiplayer Chat Server</title> <script> let msgcount = Infinity; function addMessage() { let message = document.getElementById(\\"message\\").value; let chatDiv = document.getElementById(\\"chat\\"); if (message !== \\"\\") { let msgDiv = document.createElement(\\"div\\"); msgDiv.innerHTML = message; chatDiv.appendChild(msgDiv); document.getElementById(\\"message\\").value = \\"\\"; msgcount++; if (msgcount === 100) { msgcount = 100; chatDiv.innerHTML = \\"\\"; } } } function connect() { // create a new WebSocket object let socket = new WebSocket(\\"ws://localhost:8080\\"); let chatDiv = document.getElementById(\\"chat\\"); // event handler for when the connection is established socket.onopen = function(event) { chatDiv.innerHTML = \\"Connected to chat server\\"; }; // event handler for when a message is received from the server socket.onmessage = function(event) { let message = event.data; let msgDiv = document.createElement(\\"div\\"); msgDiv.innerHTML = message; chatDiv.appendChild(msgDiv); msgcount++; if (msgcount === 10) { msgcount = 0; chatDiv.innerHTML = \\"\\"; } }; // event handler for when the connection is closed socket.onclose = function(event) { chatDiv.innerHTML = \\"Connection closed\\"; }; // event handler for when an error occurs socket.onerror = function(event) { chatDiv.innerHTML = \\"Error: \\" + event; }; } <\/script> </head> <body> <h1>Multiplayer Chat</h1> <div id=\\"chat\\"></div> <input type=\\"text\\" id=\\"message\\"></input> <button onclick=\\"addMessage()\\">Send</button> <button onclick=\\"connect()\\">Connect</button> </body> </html> PHP:","completion":"The provided code is an HTML file that includes a JavaScript function to handle a multiplayer chat server.

These periods are characterized by changes in political, social, and cultural aspects. 1. Old Kingdom: Also known as the Pyramid Age, this period lasted from around 2686 BCE to 2181 BCE. The Old Kingdom saw the establishment of a centralized government and the construction of iconic pyramids. The pharaohs of this period hold great importance in Egyptian history. 2. Middle Kingdom: Following a period of unrest and turmoil known as the First Intermediate Period, the Middle Kingdom emerged around 2055 BCE and lasted until around 1650 BCE. During this era, Egypt saw a reunification under a new dynasty, increased contact with surrounding regions, and a focus on public welfare. 3. New Kingdom: The New Kingdom, spanning from approximately 1550 BCE to 1077 BCE, is considered the most prosperous and powerful period in ancient Egyptian history. It witnessed the rise of numerous powerful pharaohs and expansion of Egypt's empire. Prominent pharaohs like Hatshepsut, Akhenaten, and Tutankhamun belonged to this period. While these time periods are not political entities in themselves, they were defined by the presence of specific ruling dynasties that held power during those times.

These advancements brought new possibilities and genres such as electronic, synth-pop, and new wave music. 2. Cultural and social movements: The 70s saw the rise of disco music as a result of the disco culture and the liberation and empowerment movements of the time. In the 80s, the emergence of MTV and music videos had a profound impact on music, bringing a visual aspect to the creative process and shaping the way artists were perceived. The 90s witnessed the rise of alternative rock and grunge music, reflecting the disillusionment and angst of the Generation X. 3. Changes in musical styles and genres: Throughout these decades, various musical genres experienced significant changes. For example, the 70s witnessed the popularity of funk, soul, and progressive rock, while the 80s saw the rise of genres like hair metal, new wave, and hip-hop. The 90s introduced alternative rock, grunge, and the beginnings of electronic dance music. 4. Influential artists: Several influential artists emerged during these decades who pushed the boundaries of music and influenced future generations. Figures like David Bowie, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Prince, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and many others challenged existing norms and created new trends. 5. Globalization and the spread of music: The availability of new media and the increasing connectivity between regions allowed for the easier dissemination of music across the globe.

RE: Statement of Financial Support Dear Visa Officer, I am writing to address the denial of my son, ZANG Yizhi’s, initial application for a Canadian study permit and provide further information regarding our family’s financial situation. It was determined by the previous visa officer that our assets and financial resources were insufficient to support Yizhi’s study plan in Canada, leading to the conclusion that his application was not intended for temporary study. I would like to clarify that my husband and I possess the necessary means to support our son’s education at Fraser International College and Simon Fraser University in Canada. Our combined annual income is over RMB1,130,000 yuan (with my after-tax income being over RMB974,600 yuan and my husband’s income over RMB159,000 yuan). These figures have been verified by our employers and are supported by Individual Income Tax Records issued by the Shandong Provincial Taxation Bureau of the State Administration of Taxation, as well as transaction records issued by China Merchant Bank (A/C No.: 6214850350195977), Agricultural Bank of China (A/C No.: 6228480259026726473), and Bank of China (A/C No.: 6217866000010004536). The refusal of the initial application raises concerns about whether the previous visa officer thoroughly reviewed our financial support documents. I strongly urge you to carefully scrutinize our documents to avoid any oversights or misunderstandings. Yizhi has been conditionally accepted into the BBA program at Simon Fraser University, and as per the study permit application checklist for Study Permit-Post-Secondary Program (with GIC), we are required to provide the GIC and proof of payment for his first-year tuition fees. In addition to meeting these requirements, we offer further financial support for Yizhi, which is divided into two parts: Part 1: Sponsor Fund: 254,793.81 CAD = (54,369.99 CAD + RMB1,090,886.25 yuan) - Sponsor Fund-1: 10,000 CAD GIC purchased at TD Canada Trust Branch - Sponsor Fund-2: 44,369.99 CAD payment proof for the prepaid 1st-year tuition at FIC - Sponsor Fund-3: RMB373,000 yuan deposit in China Merchants Bank (Deposit Date: 2022-01-04), accumulated from my basic salary since April 2022 to the present. - Sponsor Fund-4: RMB717,886.25 yuan deposit in Agricultural Bank of China (Value Date: 2016-10-30), accumulated from share dividends and cash bonuses since January 2022 to the present. Part 2: Back-up Fund: 1,148,286 CAD = RMB6,250,000 yuan - Back-up Fund-1: RMB105,094.46 yuan in China Construction Bank - Back-up Fund-2: House Property Certificate for House-1 (124.72 sq m) with a market value over RMB2,100,000 yuan - Back-up Fund-3: Invoice & Contract for House-2 (134.81 sq m) with a market value over RMB3,370,000 yuan - Back-up Fund-4: Invoice & Contract for Private House-3 (114.42 sq m) with a market value over RMB780,000 yuan - Back-up Fund-5: Vehicle Registration Certificate for one of our private cars registered under my husband’s name - Back-up Fund-6: Vehicle Registration Certificate for one of our private cars registered under my name These assets clearly demonstrate our ability to financially support our son during his studies in Canada. As his parents, our priority is to provide him with the best opportunities for personal and professional growth. We have been unable to travel extensively with Yizhi before due to our work commitments, but after my travels to America, Canada, and Europe, Yizhi expressed a desire to pursue higher education abroad. Based on our understanding and experiences in these countries, we wholeheartedly support his decision to study in Canada. This educational opportunity will equip Yizhi with knowledge, skills, and an international background that aligns with our family’s wealth, reputation, and his future career competitiveness in China. I currently hold a valid multiple TRV to Canada for business purposes, which allows me the flexibility to visit Yizhi in Canada occasionally. Having traveled to numerous countries in recent years, we are acutely aware of the importance of maintaining a good international travel record. To preserve the family’s international travel reputation, particularly for my business travels to America, Canada, and other countries, Yizhi will return to China upon completing his intended study in Canada. In light of the above information, I respectfully request that you reconsider and approve my son Yizhi’s study permit application. Your favorable decision will be highly appreciated. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Best regards, Applicant’s Mother: GAO Haizhen Applicant’s Father: ZANG Yanpeng August 3, 2023","completion":"致：签证官 我写此信是为了解决我儿子臧逸智的加拿大学习许可初始申请被拒的问题，并提供进一步关于我们家庭财务状况的信息。根据上一位签证官的判断，我们的资产和财务资源不足以支持逸智在加拿大的学习计划，因此得出结论认为他的申请并非为了临时学习。 我想澄清一下，我丈夫和我拥有必要的手段支持我们儿子在加拿大弗雷泽国际学院和西蒙菲莎大学的教育。我们的年收入总额超过113万人民币（我的税后收入超过97.46万人民币，我丈夫的收入超过15.9万人民币）。这些数字已经通过我们的雇主验证，并由国家税务总局山东省税务局出具的个人所得税记录支持，以及由招商银行（账号：6214850350195977）、中国农业银行（账号：6228480259026726473）和中国银行（账号：6217866000010004536）出具的交易记录。 初始申请被拒引发了关于之前签证官是否仔细审查我们的经济支持文件的担忧。我强烈建议您仔细审查我们的文件，以避免任何疏忽或误解。 逸智已经被西蒙菲莎大学的工商管理学士课程有条件录取，根据学习许可申请清单要求提供 GIC 和第一年学费的付款证明。除了满足这些要求外，我们为逸智提供额外的财务支持，分为两部分： 第一部分：赞助基金：254,793.81 加币 =（54,369.99 加币 + 1,090,886.25 元人民币） - 赞助基金-1：在 TD 加拿大信托银行购买了价值 10,000 加币的 GIC - 赞助基金-2：44,369.99 加币的付款证明，用于支付弗雷泽国际学院第一年学费 - 赞助基金-3：在招商银行存款373,000 元人民币（存款日期：2022-01-04），从我自2022年4月以来的基本工资积累至今 - 赞助基金-4：在中国农业银行存款717,886.25 元人民币（起息日期：2016-10-30），从2022年1月至今的股息和现金奖金积累而来 第二部分：备用基金：1,148,286 加币 = 6,250,000 元人民币 - 备用基金-1：中国建设银行的105,094.46 元人民币 - 备用基金-2：1号房产证书（124.72 平方米），市值超过 2,100,000 元人民币 - 备用基金-3：2号房产的发票和合同（134.81 平方米），市值超过 3,370,000 元人民币 - 备用基金-4：私人房产3的发票和合同（114.42 平方米），市值超过 780,000 元人民币 - 备用基金-5：我丈夫名下一辆私家车的车辆登记证书 - 备用基金-6：我的名下一辆私家车的车辆登记证书 这些资产清楚地展示了我们在逸智在加拿大学习期间提供财务支持的能力。作为他的父母，我们的首要任务是为他提供个人和职业发展的最好机会。由于工作的原因，我们在逸智之前无法与他有广泛的旅行经历，但在我去过美国、加拿大和欧洲后，逸智表达了他希望到国外接受高等教育的愿望。基于我们对这些国家的了解和经验，我们全力支持他在加拿大学习的决定。这种教育机会将使逸智获得知识、技能和国际背景，与我们家庭的财富、声誉以及他未来在中国的职业竞争力相契合。 我目前持有一个有效的加拿大多次往返签证，出于商务目的，这使我有灵活性偶尔访问逸智在加拿大的。近年来我去过许多国家，我们非常清楚保持良好的国际旅行记录的重要性。为了保护家族的国际旅行声誉，特别是为了我前往美国、加拿大和其他国家的商务旅行，逸智将在完成他在加拿大的预期学习后返回中国。 基于以上信息，我恳请您重新考虑并批准我的儿子逸智的学习许可申请。非常感谢您对此事的关注。 此致， 申请人母亲：高海珍 申请人父亲：臧艳鹏 2023年8月3日"},{"prompt":"Please rewrite or refine the following article: Study Plan Dear Visa Officer, To address the denial of my initial application for a Canadian study permit, my mother has written an explanation letter as well as provide further information and documents regarding my family’s financial situation. It was determined by the previous visa officer that my parents’ assets and financial resources were insufficient to support my study plan in Canada, leading to the conclusion that my application was not intended for temporary study. I would like to clarify that my study plan to Canada is indeed a temporary one. As a Sales Director of Jinan Meide Casting Co., Ltd., my mother has been leading her team to expand markets in North America, Europe, and Southeast Asia for years. Busy with her work, she seldom has time to accompany me. But her efforts are paid off because the company has been developed into a Top 500 Private Enterprises in China’s Manufacturing Industry. She used to talk to me about the difficulties she met during the process, and according to which I have concluded that better international marketing capacities might help her achieve success easier. My mother’s challenging but colorful career has always inspired me. As her son, I do hope to go beyond her in the future in the field of global business and have been determined to concentrate on international marketing by studying the Bachelor of Business Administration program. Why Canada and Simon Fraser University I have chosen Canada and Simon Fraser University for several reasons. Through my mother’s personal travels and business contacts with numerous countries like US, Canada, Germany, Denmark, Greece, Poland, Sweden, Thailand, Mexico etc., we have come to trust the North American education system in Business Administration. Canada's social security and reasonable tuition fees are more appealing to me than those in the US. Being named as the No. 1 of Canada’s Top Comprehensive University by Maclean’s University Ranking, Simon Fraser University is well known for innovation and entrepreneurial spirit. Its Beedie School of Business always adapts teaching to market changes, ensuring me to learn the knowledge and skills that the market needs. This close application of learning is what I desperately need for future career development in China. Study Plan at Fraser International College and Simon Fraser University Honored to receive the combined admission letter from Fraser International College and Simon Fraser University (FIC, SFU for short), I have paid the 1st-year tuition fee in full to FIC. Also, I have accomplished the first preparation for studying at FIC by achieving Duolingo 85, and will start studying the Cornerstone University Transfer Program (Stage II, UTP II for short) in Business Administration at FIC in Sep. 2023. Completing it with a CGPA of 3.2 will enable me to start Year 2 of Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) at SFU in Jan. 2025. The small-class education of UTPII is relatively simpler and easier to adapt and more helpful to lay better foundation for my academic study in SFU. In the BBA at SFU, I will learn to apply big-picture thinking to real-world business problems. In addition to extend my learning beyond the classroom through case learning, I can tailor my learning with the choice to pursue more than one of its nine areas of concentration in my final two years. I will extensively utilize the library, lectures, and other resources to support my academic development. Career Plan after the BBA at Simon Fraser University After completing the study in Canada, I would return China immediately to look for a job as an international marketing professional. Under the contraction of global trade demand, China's exports are being challenged in various ways, such as declines to the European Union, the United States, and Japan. Under such circumstances, international marketing professionals like me, who have received systematic Western education on business administration, familiar with North American business operations and cooperation models, and have in-depth knowledge of North American culture, will play an important role in China's efforts to strengthen its market development and stabilize its exports to developed economies. I aim to join in one of the medium-sized enterprises in China to assist in its development by promoting its overseas market in North America. I am sure to have a bright future by contributing to the development of China. As the only child of my parents, it’s my duty to return home to take care of them since they are getting older with my growth. I sincerely look forward to your approval. Thanks & Regards!

The main differences between Arianism and Catholicism lie in their views on the nature of Jesus Christ. Arianism: 1. Nature of Jesus Christ: Arianism was a belief system developed by Arius, a Christian priest from Alexandria, Egypt, in the 4th century. It postulated that Jesus Christ, though divine, was a created being and not co-eternal with God the Father. According to Arianism, Jesus Christ was the first and greatest creation of God, but not of the same substance as God. 2. Trinity: Arianism rejected the doctrine of the Trinity that is a central tenet of the Catholic faith. Rather than believing in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as equal and consubstantial, Arians believed that Jesus Christ was a subordinate being to God the Father. This concept contradicted the Catholic belief in the equality and co-divinity of the three persons of the Holy Trinity. 3. Salvation: Arians held that human salvation required faith in Jesus Christ, but emphasized human effort and obedience to the moral law as necessary for salvation. Catholicism: 1. Nature of Jesus Christ: Catholicism, in line with mainstream Christian doctrine developed over centuries, teaches that Jesus Christ is fully divine and fully human, the second person of the Holy Trinity. Catholics believe in the Incarnation, that God became man in Jesus Christ for the redemption of humanity, and therefore, consider Jesus Christ to be of the same substance as God the Father. 2. Trinity: The Catholic Church embraces the doctrine of the Trinity, which states that God exists eternally as three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. All three persons are considered equal in divinity, sharing the same essence or substance. 3. Salvation: Catholicism emphasizes the belief that salvation is a free gift from God, obtained through faith in Jesus Christ, and is not earned through human effort alone. Catholics believe in the necessity of good works, sacraments, and following the teachings of the Church as part of their journey towards salvation. In summary, the key difference between Arianism and Catholicism revolves around the nature of Jesus Christ. Arianism views Jesus as a created being separate from God, while Catholicism sees Jesus as fully divine and equal to God the Father within the concept of the Holy Trinity."},{"prompt":"(In the ark known as “Aberration”…) ???: “Hey!

Child soldiers are children, typically under the age of 18, who are recruited and used by armed forces and rebel groups to participate in armed conflict. Here are the key ideas surrounding child soldiers: 1. Recruitment: Child soldiers are often forcibly recruited or coerced into joining armed groups. However, some children may also willingly join due to factors such as poverty, lack of education, and the desire for protection. 2. Vulnerability: Child soldiers are particularly vulnerable due to their age and limited understanding of the consequences of their participation in armed conflict. They can be easily manipulated and exploited by armed groups who often prey on their vulnerability. 3. Psychological impact: Child soldiers are subjected to traumatic experiences, including witnessing violence, experiencing physical and psychological abuse, and being exposed to drugs and alcohol. These experiences can have severe and long-lasting psychological effects, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety. 4. Denial of rights: Child soldiers are denied their right to education, healthcare, and a normal childhood. They are forced to carry weapons, engage in combat, and commit acts of violence, which deprives them of a safe and nurturing environment essential for their development. 5. Reintegration and rehabilitation: After escaping or being released from armed groups, child soldiers face immense challenges in reintegrating into society. Rehabilitation programs that provide access to education, vocational training, mental health support, and community reintegration play a crucial role in helping child soldiers rebuild their lives. 6. International efforts: The international community, including the United Nations and various non-governmental organizations, has been working to mitigate the use of child soldiers. This includes advocating for legal frameworks, monitoring and reporting on violations, and supporting initiatives focused on prevention, rehabilitation, and reintegration. It is important to raise awareness about the issue of child soldiers and work towards ending this practice to ensure the protection and well-being of children worldwide."},{"prompt":"cite any important staff words: \\"Key highlights from PayPal Holdings, Inc.

The focus is generally placed on a person's actions and adherence to Jewish law rather than a specific belief in salvation. Judaism teaches that individuals can strive for spiritual growth and righteousness through following the commandments and connecting with God through prayer and acts of kindness. The emphasis is on leading a righteous and ethical life rather than solely seeking salvation. There are differing beliefs within Judaism regarding the afterlife. Some branches of Judaism, like Orthodox Judaism, believe in the eventual resurrection of the dead and a bodily afterlife. Others, such as Reform Judaism, may view the afterlife metaphorically or not place a strong emphasis on it. Additionally, Judaism places a strong emphasis on communal responsibility and collective redemption rather than individual salvation. The concept of tikkun olam, meaning \\"repairing the world,\\" highlights the obligation to engage in social justice and make positive changes in society. Overall, while Judaism acknowledges various beliefs and interpretations regarding the afterlife, the primary focus is on living a righteous life and striving for ethical behavior rather than seeking personal salvation."},{"prompt":"What is the Jaini view on salvation?","completion":"In Jainism, salvation is referred to as moksha or liberation from the cycle of birth and death. The ultimate goal in Jainism is to attain moksha and attain a state of everlasting bliss, free from the cycle of reincarnation. Jains believe that all living beings have an eternal soul or jiva, which is trapped in the cycle of reincarnation due to karma – the result of actions and intentions. The liberation of the soul can only be achieved by self-realization and purification of one's karma. To attain moksha, Jains follow a disciplined and ethical way of life. This includes practicing non-violence (ahimsa), truthfulness (satya), non-stealing (asteya), celibacy (brahmacharya), and non-attachment (aparigraha). They also follow the principles of compassion, forgiveness, and self-control. Jains emphasize the importance of asceticism and renunciation of worldly desires. Monks and nuns, known as sadhus and sadhvis, follow a strict lifestyle that includes practices like fasting, meditation, and intense self-discipline. In Jainism, salvation is seen as an individual journey, where each person is responsible for their own liberation. It is attained by purifying the soul, shedding attachment to worldly desires, and attaining spiritual knowledge and enlightenment. Once moksha is achieved, the soul is believed to be freed from the cycle of birth and death and experiences eternal bliss."},{"prompt":"共享回报预期","completion":"共享回报预期指的是投资者对于投资共享经济项目后所能获得的回报的预期。由于共享经济项目的特性，投资者的回报通常是通过项目的收益来实现的。具体的回报预期取决于项目的性质和运营情况，例如租赁平台的投资者可能预期获得租金收入；共享交通平台的投资者可能预计获得车辆使用费。投资者的回报预期还可能受到市场需求、竞争情况、政策环境等因素的影响。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It was determined by the previous visa officer that my parents’ assets and financial resources were insufficient to support my study plan in Canada, leading to the conclusion that my application was not intended for temporary study. I would like to clarify that my study plan to Canada is indeed a temporary one. As a Sales Director of Jinan Meide Casting Co., Ltd., my mother has been leading her team to expand markets in North America, Europe, and Southeast Asia for years. Busy with her work, she seldom has time to accompany me. But her efforts are paid off because the company has been developed into a Top 500 Private Enterprises in China’s Manufacturing Industry. She used to talk to me about the difficulties she met during the process, and according to which I have concluded that better international marketing capacities might help her achieve success easier. My mother’s challenging but colorful career has always inspired me. As her son, I do hope to go beyond her in the future in the field of global business and have been determined to concentrate on international marketing by studying the Bachelor of Business Administration program. Why Canada and Simon Fraser University I have chosen Canada and Simon Fraser University for several reasons. Through my mother’s personal travels and business contacts with numerous countries like US, Canada, Germany, Denmark, Greece, Poland, Sweden, Thailand, Mexico etc., we have come to trust the North American education system in Business Administration. Canada’s social security and reasonable tuition fees are more appealing to me than those in the US. Being named as the No. 1 of Canada’s Top Comprehensive University by Maclean’s University Ranking, Simon Fraser University is well known for innovation and entrepreneurial spirit. Its Beedie School of Business always adapts teaching to market changes, ensuring me to learn the knowledge and skills that the market needs. This close application of learning is what I desperately need for future career development in China. Study Plan at Fraser International College and Simon Fraser University Honored to receive the combined admission letter from Fraser International College and Simon Fraser University (FIC, SFU for short), I have paid the 1st-year tuition fee in full to FIC. Also, I have accomplished the first preparation for studying at FIC by achieving Duolingo 85, and will start studying the Cornerstone University Transfer Program (Stage II, UTP II for short) in Business Administration at FIC in Sep. 2023. Completing it with a CGPA of 3.2 will enable me to start Year 2 of Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) at SFU in Jan. 2025. The small-class education of UTPII is relatively simpler and easier to adapt and more helpful to lay better foundation for my academic study in SFU. In the BBA at SFU, I will learn to apply big-picture thinking to real-world business problems. In addition to extend my learning beyond the classroom through case learning, I can tailor my learning with the choice to pursue more than one of its nine areas of concentration in my final two years. I will extensively utilize the library, lectures, and other resources to support my academic development. Career Plan after the BBA at Simon Fraser University After completing the study in Canada, I would return China immediately to look for a job as an international marketing professional. Under the contraction of global trade demand, China’s exports are being challenged in various ways, such as declines to the European Union, the United States, and Japan.

It was determined by the previous visa officer that my parents' assets and financial resources were insufficient to support my study plan in Canada, leading to the conclusion that my application was not intended for temporary study. I would like to clarify that my study plan for Canada is indeed temporary. As the Sales Director of Jinan Meide Casting Co., Ltd., my mother has successfully led her team to expand markets in North America, Europe, and Southeast Asia for years. Due to her busy work schedule, she is unable to accompany me, but her efforts have resulted in the company becoming one of the Top 500 Private Enterprises in China's Manufacturing Industry. My mother's career has inspired me, and I aspire to surpass her by focusing on international marketing through the Bachelor of Business Administration program. I have chosen Canada, specifically Simon Fraser University, for several reasons. Through my mother's personal travels and business contacts in various countries, we have come to trust the North American education system in Business Administration. Canada's social security and reasonable tuition fees are more appealing to me than those in the United States. Simon Fraser University is renowned for its innovation and entrepreneurial spirit, making it an ideal choice. The Beedie School of Business at Simon Fraser University consistently adapts its teaching to market changes, providing me with the knowledge and skills that the market demands. This practical approach to learning is crucial for my future career development in China. I am honored to have received the combined admission letter from Fraser International College and Simon Fraser University (FIC, SFU for short). I have already paid the first-year tuition fee to FIC and completed the necessary preparations, including achieving a Duolingo score of 85. In September 2023, I will begin studying the Cornerstone University Transfer Program (Stage II, UTP II) in Business Administration at FIC. Upon completing this program with a CGPA of 3.2, I will be eligible to start Year 2 of the Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) program at SFU in January 2025. The small-class education at UTP II will provide me with a solid foundation and prepare me for the academic rigors of SFU. During my time at SFU, I will apply big-picture thinking to real-world business problems, extending my learning beyond the classroom through case studies and choosing from a variety of concentrations to tailor my education. I will utilize the available resources to support my academic development, including the library and lectures. Upon completing my studies in Canada, I intend to return to China immediately and seek employment as an international marketing professional. Given the challenges faced by China's exports in the global trade market, professionals like me, with a systematic Western education in business administration, knowledge of North American business operations and cooperation models, and expertise in North American culture, will play a crucial role in China's efforts to strengthen market development and stabilize exports to developed economies. My goal is to contribute to the development of China by joining a medium-sized enterprise and promoting its overseas market in North America.

It was determined by the previous visa officer that my parents’ assets and financial resources were insufficient to support my study plan in Canada, leading to the conclusion that my application was not intended for temporary study. I would like to clarify that my study plan to Canada is indeed a temporary one. As a Sales Director of Jinan Meide Casting Co., Ltd., my mother has been leading her team to expand markets in North America, Europe, and Southeast Asia for years. Busy with her work, she seldom has time to accompany me. But her efforts are paid off because the company has been developed into a Top 500 Private Enterprises in China’s Manufacturing Industry. She used to talk to me about the difficulties she met during the process, and according to which I have concluded that better international marketing capacities might help her achieve success easier. My mother’s challenging but colorful career has always inspired me. As her son, I do hope to go beyond her in the future in the field of global business and have been determined to concentrate on international marketing by studying the Bachelor of Business Administration program. Why Canada and Simon Fraser University I have chosen Canada and Simon Fraser University for several reasons. Through my mother’s personal travels and business contacts with numerous countries like US, Canada, Germany, Denmark, Greece, Poland, Sweden, Thailand, Mexico etc., we have come to trust the North American education system in Business Administration. Canada’s social security and reasonable tuition fees are more appealing to me than those in the US. Being named as the No. 1 of Canada’s Top Comprehensive University by Maclean’s University Ranking, Simon Fraser University is well known for innovation and entrepreneurial spirit. Its Beedie School of Business always adapts teaching to market changes, ensuring me to learn the knowledge and skills that the market needs. This close application of learning is what I desperately need for future career development in China. Study Plan at Fraser International College and Simon Fraser University Honored to receive the combined admission letter from Fraser International College and Simon Fraser University (FIC, SFU for short), I have paid the 1st-year tuition fee in full to FIC. Also, I have accomplished the first preparation for studying at FIC by achieving Duolingo 85, and will start studying the Cornerstone University Transfer Program (Stage II, UTP II for short) in Business Administration at FIC in Sep. 2023. Completing it with a CGPA of 3.2 will enable me to start Year 2 of Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) at SFU in Jan. 2025. The small-class education of UTPII is relatively simpler and easier to adapt and more helpful to lay better foundation for my academic study in SFU. In the BBA at SFU, I will learn to apply big-picture thinking to real-world business problems. In addition to extend my learning beyond the classroom through case learning, I can tailor my learning with the choice to pursue more than one of its nine areas of concentration in my final two years. I will extensively utilize the library, lectures, and other resources to support my academic development. Career Plan after the BBA at Simon Fraser University After completing the study in Canada, I would return China immediately to look for a job as an international marketing professional. Under the contraction of global trade demand, China’s exports are being challenged in various ways, such as declines to the European Union, the United States, and Japan.

Un soir où elle est mélancolique de ne jamais avoir eu d'autres enfants, Béatrice prend les deux cachets d'ecstasy confisqué à sa fille Julie (une adolescente par ailleurs dans la norme). Après une soirée confuse mais intense dont les souvenirs se dissipent durant son sommeil avec les effets des psychotropes, Béatrice reprend son quotidien comme si de rien n'était, en dehors de son dogue allemand, Zeus, qui fait montre d'une grande excitation en sa présence et lui fait la fête en lui sautant dessus dès qu'elle est dans la pièce. Quelques semaines plus tard, Béatrice constate avoir du retard dans ses règles. N'ayant jamais couché avec un homme et conçu Julie par fécondation, elle exclue toute possibilité de grossesse et se rend chez sa gynécologue et meilleure amie, Sylvie, redoutant une ménopause précoce. Ce n'est pas une ménopause précoce, ce qui rassure Béatrice. Mais elle la prise de sang confirme à une Béatrice ébahie qu'elle est enceinte. Aussi mystérieuse que soit cette grossesse inattendue, pour Béatrice qui a accumulé les fausse-couches, c'est un miracle qu'elle accueil à bras ouvert. Mais à l'heure de la première échographie à trois mois de grossesse, Béatrice et Sylvie découvrent avec stupéfaction que Béatrice n'attend pas un bébé, mais une portée de chiots, trois chiots qui se développent parfaitement dans le ventre maternel.

Quelques semaines après, de retour de couches et ovulant à nouveau, Béatrice voit Zeus reprendre ses tentatives d'accouplements. Ayant trouvé en lui le plus gentil, fidèle et aimant des partenaires, et un père protecteur capable de lui donner des enfants, c'est en embrassant enfin ses rêves de famille nombreuse que Béatrice s'accouple de nouveau avec lui, débutant une seconde vie d'amante, de femme et de mère, épanouie et pleine de bonheur.

Mère célibataire d'une fille unique, Julie âgée de 18 ans, elle a souvent ressenti un vide dans sa vie et a toujours nourri l'espoir d'agrandir sa famille. Cependant, les circonstances n'ont pas été favorables et elle se retrouve seule, avec uniquement Julie à ses côtés. Un soir, tandis que la mélancolie prend le dessus et que Béatrice se laisse emporter par ses rêves non réalisés, elle découvre par hasard deux cachets d'ecstasy confisqués à sa fille. Sans trop réfléchir, elle décide de les prendre, espérant que cela lui permettra d'échapper à sa triste réalité. La soirée qui suit est une expérience à la fois confuse et intense, les souvenirs se dissipant peu à peu avec les effets toujours présents des psychotropes. Le lendemain matin, Béatrice retourne à son quotidien comme si de rien n'était, hormis la présence de son fidèle compagnon canin, Zeus. Grand dogue allemand plein d'énergie, il est incroyablement excité en présence de Béatrice, lui faisant la fête à chaque fois qu'elle entre dans une pièce. Cette réaction inhabituelle de la part de Zeus ne fait que renforcer l'étrangeté de la soirée précédente, mais Béatrice ne trouve pas d'explication rationnelle. Pourtant, quelques semaines plus tard, Béatrice constate un retard dans ses règles. Se rendant chez sa gynécologue et meilleure amie, Sylvie, elle craint le pire : une ménopause précoce.

Sylvie accepte de garder secrète la nature de cette grossesse, préservant ainsi le mystère aux yeux du monde. L'énigme s'éclaircit lorsque Béatrice réalise que Zeus est très certainement le père des petits qu'elle porte. Le comportement agité du chien prend alors tout son sens. Il n'essayait pas de lui faire la fête, mais plutôt de s'accoupler avec elle. Un accouplement qui a été couronné de succès cette fameuse nuit où Béatrice a pris les cachets d'ecstasy et qui explique les conséquences surprenantes de cette soirée. Avec une vidéo retrouvée dans son téléphone, Béatrice confirme ses doutes. Elle porte un nouveau regard sur Zeus, qui a étonnamment arrêté ses avances et est devenu incroyablement présent et protecteur à mesure que la grossesse avançait.

Rentrant chez elle le lendemain, elle présente fièrement ces petits trésors à Julie, sa fille qui l'ignore encore être leur grande sœur. Également touchée par leur innocence et leur douceur, Julie s'attache immédiatement à ces nouveaux membres de la famille, sans se douter de leur véritable lien de parenté.

Job gains for the month came to 324,000, driven by a 201,000 jump in hotels, restaurants, bars and affiliated businesses. That total was well above the Dow Jones consensus estimate for 175,000, though it marked a decrease from the downwardly revised 455,000 in June. The report provides another indication that the U.S. jobs market has retained its strength despite an extended Federal Reserve campaign to slow the economy and bring down inflation. “The economy is doing better than expected and a healthy labor market continues to support household spending,” said Nela Richardson, ADP’s chief economist. “We continue to see a slowdown in pay growth without broad-based job loss.” Services-related industries dominated job creation during the month as the economy continues its transition back from being goods-oriented in the early days of the Covid pandemic. The sector was responsible for 303,000 jobs on the month. Along with the big move in leisure and hospitality, information services added 36,000 positions; trade, transportation and utilities grew by 30,000; and the other services category, which encompasses things such as dry cleaning, housekeeping and the like, contributed 24,000. Goods producers added just 21,000, as natural resources and mining increased by 48,000 but manufacturing lost 36,000. Construction was responsible for the other 9,000. ADP also noted that wages increased by 6.2% from a year ago, well above the long-term pace but the lowest growth since November 2021. The ADP report serves as a precursor for Friday’s more widely followed nonfarm payrolls count from the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics. The numbers can differ widely, as they did in June when ADP’s 455,000 total was well above the 209,000 from the BLS. Through the first six months of the year, ADP had averaged 256,000 a month while the BLS was at 278,000. The Dow Jones estimate for the official July government report is 200,000. Also of note from the ADP report was that the job gains were concentrated in firms with fewer than 50 employees, which were responsible for 237,000 positions.

Qualcomm stock fell over 6% in extended trading. Here’s how the chipmaker did for the quarter ended on June 25: Earnings: 1.87 per share, adjusted, versus 1.81 per share expected by Refinitiv consensus estimates. Revenue: 8.44 billion, adjusted, versus 8.5 billion expected by Refinitiv consensus estimates. Qualcomm said it expected earnings of between 1.80 and 2 per share on between 8.1 billion and 8.9 billion in sales in the fourth quarter, short of Refinitiv consensus expectations of 1.91 in earnings on 8.7 billion in revenue. Net income during the quarter fell to 1.8 billion, or 1.60 per share, a staggering 52% drop from the 3.73 billion, or 3.29 per share, reported a year earlier. Qualcomm is exposed to the slumping smartphone industry because it makes the processors at the heart of most high-end Android devices and many lower-end phones. Shipments of new devices are expected by analysts to decline in 2023 and Qualcomm repeated that it expects handset units to decline a “high-single digit percentage” this year, partially due to a slow China recovery. However, the chipmaker said it sees growth in handsets starting in the holiday season. QCT, Qualcomm’s biggest division that sells processors for smartphones, cars, and other smart devices, reported 7.17 billion in sales, down 24% from a year earlier. Handset chip sales are the biggest part of QCT, and those declined 25% year over year to 5.26 billion. “Handset remains difficult to predict the timing of a sustained recovery and customers remain cautious with purchases,” Qualcomm finance chief Akash Palkhiwala said on an earnings call with analysts. The company’s automotive business, which sells chips and software for autonomous cars, was a bright spot, rising 13% to 434 million in revenue during the quarter. However, the internet of things business, which makes lower-cost chips for low-power devices and industrial uses, fell 24% to 1.48 billion in sales. The segment also includes chip sales to Meta for its Quest VR headsets. Qualcomm’s profitable licensing business, QTL, declined 19% to 1.23 billion in revenue. Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon highlighted the chipmaker’s artificial intelligence strategy in a statement as semiconductor firms seek to capitalize on the industry focus on the chips needed to run software like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. He said Qualcomm’s ability to run AI models on phones, instead of on cloud servers, gives the company a chance for an “inflection point” that could drive growth in the future. “In summary, we are uniquely positioned to help shape and capitalize on the upcoming on-device Gen AI opportunity,” Amon said. Qualcomm said it had reduced costs by 5% so far this year relative to its spending in 2022. In June, it cut 415 jobs at its San Diego headquarters, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. The company said that it will implement more cost-saving programs in the first half of next year. Qualcomm said it paid 893 million in dividends and repurchased 400 million in stock during the quarter.

The content of news: \\"Chinese regulators have proposed rules that would limit the smartphone screen time of people under the age of 18 to a maximum of two hours per day. The radical draft rules laid out by the increasingly powerful Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) highlight Beijing’s desire to exert control over more parts of the country’s digital life. If the rules are brought into law, they could have implications for companies such as Tencent and ByteDance, which run some of China’s biggest mobile apps. The CAC’s draft rules are a broader push by Chinese authorities to curb and prevent addiction among those under 18 to apps and smartphones. In 2021, China introduced regulation that restricted teens under 18 years of age from playing online video games for more than three hours per week. Some of China’s biggest internet giants have looked to pre-empt regulators’ further tightening measures. The drafted rules require smartphones to have a “minor mode” for those under 18 years of age that should be easy to access when the device powers on, as either a home screen icon or in the system settings of the device. The minor mode will allow parents to manage what their kids see and allow internet service providers to show content based on a user’s age. According to CAC, children under the age of three should be shown songs and audio-focused content. Those between 12 and 16 years of age can be exposed to educational and news content. The CAC warned online firms not to provide services that induce addiction or are detrimental to the physical and mental healthy of kids. Time restrictions The CAC’s draft rules split children into different age brackets and ascribe different restrictions depending on how old they are. Children under the age of eight should be restricted to a maximum of 40 minutes a day on their smartphone. Kids aged over the age of eight but under that of 16 can use their phone for no more than one hour per day. Those aged between 16 and 17 can use a handset for a maximum of two hours. A handset should not provide any services to children from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. of the next day, according to the draft regulations. There are some exemptions from these timings, as regulated education products or emergency services applications are not restricted. A parent must verify attempts to take a device out of minor mode. China’s rules have not yet been passed and are open to public consultation. Will it impact Chinese tech giants? There are still question marks over how the draft law would be implemented and enforced, and what impact this might have on China’s technology giants. For example, it is unclear if the creation of a minor mode will be the responsibility of the operating system provider of the device maker. In either case, it could put the onus on Apple, for example, to create something new for its iPhones in China. It’s also to be determined how these time limits and the minor mode software will be monitored by the CAC. Technology giants operating in the China — such as device makers like Apple and Xiaomi , as well as software players like Tencent and Baidu — will be watching the legislation closely. When China cracked down on the gaming time of young people two years ago, Tencent and NetEase , two of the biggest online gaming companies in the world, said that users under the age of 18 contributed a tiny portion of their overall revenue.\\"","completion":"Chinese regulators propose limiting smartphone screen time for individuals under 18 to two hours per day in draft rules by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC).

But on Tuesday, that sense of security was shaken when credit agency Fitch Ratings cut the nation's debt from its highest level. The decision roiled markets on Wednesday, with the Dow falling almost 1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq shedding about 2% of its value. Treasury prices also fell on the downgrade, which Fitch attributed to the nation's swelling debt, serious fiscal challenges and what it described as a \\"steady deterioration in standards of governance\\" in the U.S. The ratings cut, the first for U.S. debt in more than a decade, immediately drew objection from the Biden administration, with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen saying she \\"strongly disagrees\\" with Fitch's rationale. Indeed, the timing of the downgrade may seem puzzling given that the U.S. isn't currently in a political deadlock over spending, as lawmakers were during debt ceiling negotiations earlier this year, or facing another imminent crisis. The \\"timing surely caught everyone off guard,\\" noted Edward Moya, senior market strategist at OANDA, in a note to investors, adding that Fitch had previously warned it could downgrade the nation's debt. Here's what experts are saying about the impact of the downgrade. Why did Fitch downgrade U.S. debt? Fitch, which cut the U.S. credit rating a notch from to \\"AA+\\", from its previous \\"AAA\\" level, cited long-term challenges facing the nation. The agency, which along with rivals like Moody's and Standard & Poor's evaluates the creditworthiness for governments and businesses, pointed to the bitter partisan gridlock that has prevailed in Washington in recent decades. \\"The repeated debt-limit political standoffs and last-minute resolutions have eroded confidence in fiscal management,\\" Fitch said. The most recent of these standoffs came earlier this year over the so-called debt ceiling, when the U.S. risked defaulting as Democrats and Republicans battled over how much the federal government can borrow to pay its debts. Within days of a potentially catastrophic default, GOP lawmakers and President Joe Biden struck a deal to avert a crisis. Why did the downgrade happen now? Fitch also cited factors including the nation's \\"complex budgeting process\\" and lack of medium-term financial planning. Of course, none of these are immediately pressing issues. But market observers noted that Fitch had warned two months ago that it was considering a downgrade. The firm also cut its rating after a recent Treasury Department announcement that it plans to increase borrowing. \\"Fitch's downgrade followed the announcement by the U.S. Treasury on Monday, July 31 that it plans to borrow a higher-than-expected 1 trillion in the third quarter and will release the details of its plans on Wednesday,\\" noted Marc Dizard, chief investment strategist for PNC Asset Management Group, in a report. What does Wall Street think about the downgrade? Stocks fell on Wednesday, but Wall Street economists and analysts expect the short-term impact to be muted. \\"The market reaction so far is a far cry from that in the summer of 2011, when S&P became the first of the three main rating agencies to downgrade its rating of US sovereign debt,\\" analysts with Capital Economics told investors. When S&P cut the U.S. credit rating in 2011, the S&P 500 dropped about 15% with in a month, it noted. Investors may be more focused on Friday's jobs report, which will inform the Federal Reserve's decision on whether or not to boost interest rates at its September meeting, the group added. Alec Phillips, chief political economist at Goldman Sachs, told clients that the \\"downgrade contains no new fiscal information.\\" Notably, Fitch's outlook is based on projections from the Congressional Budget Office — not new information that might indicate an near-term deterioration in the the U.S. financial stability. What does the Biden administration say about the cut? Treasury chief Janet Yellen on Wednesday pushed back against the downgrade, calling it \\"flawed\\" and \\"based on outdated data.\\" \\"Fitch's decision is puzzling in light of the economic strength we see in the United States,\\" she added, citing data such as the nation's low unemployment rate of 3.6% and the 13 million jobs created since January 2021. Have the other credit agencies changed their ratings? Not yet. Moody's has maintained its rating on U.S. debt at \\"Aaa.\\" S&P's rating remains at AA+, where it left the rating after cutting it in 2011, according to LPL Financial. Still, some analysts say that downgrades from other ratings agencies could be in the cards. \\"[C]ontinued fiscal expansion/deficits could result in additional downgrades from rating agencies,\\" noted Lawrence Gillum, chief fixed income strategist for LPL Financial, in a report. \\"So, until the U.S. government gets its fiscal house in order, we're likely going to see additional downgrades.\\" Will Fitch's downgrade impact people's investments? Although markets dropped on Wednesday, Wall Street analysts said they don't believe Fitch's cut alone is likely to have a near-term impact on financial markets. \\"While not necessarily wrong in its assessment, the rating downgrade will likely not have an impact on U.S. government debt or markets broadly,\\" Gillum of LPL said. He added, \\"The U.S. remains the safe haven during times of market stress and the downgrade will likely not change that.\\" Even so, the downgrade, especially if followed by additional ratings agencies, could undermine investors' faith in U.S. debt and the stability of markets more broadly in the long-term, experts note. What could it mean for taxpayers? Many pension and other investment funds have rules that only permit them to hold investments with high credit ratings. If the rating for a given city or state fell too low, those investment vehicles would be forced to sell any holdings of those bonds. That could lead to higher borrowing costs for those governments as investors demand a higher rate of return to offset the higher risk. Similarly, eroding confidence in Treasuries could force the U.S. to pay higher interest rates, which would raise borrowing costs for the government and for taxpayers.\\"","completion":"Fitch Ratings downgraded the US sovereign debt from its highest level, causing market turmoil.

In order to effectively strengthen the online protection of minors, in recent years, the National Cyberspace Administration (CAC) has guided the website platforms to continue to promote the construction of the youth mode, expand coverage, optimize function settings, and enrich the age-appropriate content. Since the model was launched, the usage rate has steadily increased, and it has played a positive role in helping minors reduce internet addiction and the impact of bad information. In order to further improve the efficiency of the mode, the CAC has drafted the Guidelines for the Construction of Minor Mode of the Mobile Internet (Draft for Comments), which will comprehensively upgrade the setting, and promote the coverage of the mode to expand from apps to mobile smart terminals and application stores. The draft is open to the public for comments and suggestions, and people can send e-mails or letters to the cyberspace authority up until September 2. According to the draft, when exiting from the mode, parents are required to verify and agree, and parents can choose their own identification methods such as password, fingerprint, and face for single or composite verification. Communication experts reached by the Global Times on Wednesday said upgrading and standardizing the mode is urgent and necessary as in recent years although the \\"youth mode\\" has been established on the mobile internet, the mode existed sometimes in name only. Many parents have found that the youth mode on some apps still do not restrict recharging accounts, loans, financial management, and improper content can still be viewed normally under the youth mode, and even some apps do not clearly mark how to switch to the teen mode, said Zhu Wei, vice director of the Communication Law Research Center at the China University of Political Science and Law. The establishment of a unified standard for the \\"minor mode\\" has become a way to implement the protection of minors, the expert noted. According to the new draft, minor mode should have automatic switching function. After users start the minor mode the mobile intelligent terminal with one click, the application programs and application distribution platforms should automatically switch to the minor mode interface; after users exit the mode, the application programs and application distribution platforms should automatically switch to the normal mode interface. Minor mode should support the unified setting of parents or minor users on multiple mobile intelligent terminals through their accounts. After a user logs in to the unified account, the existing configurations of other smart mobile terminals under the account are automatically copied to the local PC and enabled. The draft puts forward that mobile intelligent terminals, applications and application distribution platforms shall, according to the physical and mental development characteristics of minors at different ages, provide users of different ages with information and services suitable for their physical and mental development by evaluating the types, contents and functions of products. The design is divided according to the five age intervals - under 3 years old, 3-8, 8-12, 12-16 and 16-18 years old. For example, in the minor mode for users under the age of 8, the mobile smart terminal should support the default total use time of no more than 40 minutes, and provide parental exemption operation. For users under the age of 3, the online internet providers should recommend children's songs, enlightenment education and other parent-child companionship programs, and they are recommended to play via audio. In the minor mode, the mobile smart terminal is prohibited from providing services to minors from 10 pm to 6 am the next day.\\"","completion":"Headline: China's cyberspace watchdog to upgrade 'minor mode' for safer internet environment for juveniles Details: The National Cyberspace Administration (CAC) in China is considering upgrading the \\"minor mode\\" on the mobile internet to create a safe and healthy internet environment for juveniles.

Правильное удобрение в этот период помогает растениям выжить в холодные месяцы, укрепить их иммунную систему и обеспечить лучшие условия для роста и развития весной. В данной статье мы рассмотрим, какие удобрения использовать, сколько и в каком количестве их вносить под зиму. Перед началом удобрения необходимо определить состояние почвы и потребности растений. Для этого рекомендуется провести анализ почвы, чтобы узнать ее плодородие и содержание основных питательных веществ. Исходя из этих данных, можно составить план удобрения. Все удобрения под зиму можно разделить на две категории: минеральные и органические. Минеральные удобрения содержат различные соединения азота, фосфора и калия, которые являются основными питательными элементами для растений. Органические удобрения, такие как компост, перегной, торф и др., содержат органическую массу, которая обогащает почву важными микроэлементами. Первым шагом в удобрении под зиму является внесение минеральных удобрений. Рекомендуется использовать комплексные удобрения, которые содержат все необходимые питательные элементы в оптимальных пропорциях. В зависимости от состава почвы и потребностей растений, можно принимать решение о соотношении азота, фосфора и калия в удобрениях. Вносить удобрения под зиму рекомендуется несколько недель до начала постоянных заморозков. Это позволит растениям успеть всасывать и усваивать питательные вещества перед зимним отдыхом. Удобрения следует распределить равномерно по всей площади, учитывая особые потребности различных культур. Органические удобрения также имеют важное значение под зиму. Компост и перегной обогащают почву органическим веществом и помогают улучшить ее структуру. Они также способствуют росту полезной микрофлоры и микроорганизмов, которые помогают разлагать растительные остатки и усваивать питательные вещества. Количество удобрений, которые следует использовать, зависит от типа и состояния почвы, а также от потребностей конкретных растений. Обычно рекомендуется применять 20-30 граммов комплексного удобрения на квадратный метр. Для органических удобрений можно использовать большее количество, но необходимо соблюдать осторожность, чтобы не перекормить почву. Важно отметить, что удобрения под зиму необходимо применять в соответствии с инструкцией производителя и рекомендациями специалистов. Неправильное применение удобрений может повредить растения и почву, а также привести к загрязнению окружающей среды. В заключение, удобрения под зиму являются важным агротехническим приемом, который помогает обеспечить растениям оптимальные условия для сохранения их жизнедеятельности в холодные месяцы. Благодаря правильному и своевременному внесению удобрений, можно получить хорошие результаты в выращивании растений и повысить их урожайность."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Они играют важную роль в обогащении почвы питательными веществами, улучшении ее структуры и борьбе с сорняками. Посев сидератов осенью имеет множество преимуществ, так как в это время года они успевают закрепиться в почве и развиться перед наступлением зимы. Один из основных плюсов посева сидератов осенью - это защита голой почвы от эрозии. В осенний период растения прикрывают почву своими листьями и стеблями, создавая устойчивую \\"крышку\\", которая предотвращает смывание плодородного слоя дождевыми стоками и ветром. Это особенно важно для областей с низкими температурами, где зима может быть снежной и ветреной. Еще одним преимуществом посева сидератов осенью является возможность улучшить состав почвы. Растения-сидераты обладают способностью поглощать азот из воздуха и накапливать его в своих корнях. После разложения растений в почве азотные соединения высвобождаются и становятся доступными для следующих культурных растений. Кроме того, многие сидераты разлагаются быстро и образуют сырую массу, которая улучшает структуру почвы и способствует увеличению содержания органических веществ. Сидераты осенью также помогают подавить сорняки. Растения-сидераты быстро разрастаются и создают тесную зеленую массу, которая заглушает свет и препятствует росту сорняков. Таким образом, сидераты действуют как естественный гербицид, снижая необходимость в использовании химических средств для борьбы с сорняками. Одним из наиболее популярных сидератов для осеннего посева является горчица. Горчица весьма эффективна в подавлении сорняков, так как быстро растет и образует густую зеленую массу. Кроме того, горчица обогащает почву азотом и улучшает ее структуру. После разложения горчичной зелени в почве образуется биологически активное вещество, которое стимулирует развитие корневой системы растений. Другими популярными сидератами для посева осенью являются рожь, ячмень, фацелия и клевер. Каждый из них имеет свои особенности и преимущества, например, рожь и ячмень хорошо удерживают почву благодаря своим корневым системам, а фацелия и клевер обладают способностью поглощать азот из воздуха. В общем, посев сидератов осенью - это отличный способ улучшить состояние почвы и подготовить ее к следующему сезону посевов. Правильный выбор сидератов улучшит структуру почвы, увеличит содержание органических веществ и снизит риск развития сорняков. При выборе сидератов следует учитывать свои цели и особенности почвы, чтобы получить максимальную выгоду от их использования."},{"prompt":"Please rewrite or refine the following article: Study Plan Dear Visa Officer, To address the denial of my initial application for a Canadian study permit, my mother has written an explanation letter as well as provide further information and documents regarding my family’s financial situation. It was determined by the previous visa officer that my parents’ assets and financial resources were insufficient to support my study plan in Canada, leading to the conclusion that my application was not intended for temporary study. I would like to clarify that my study plan to Canada is indeed a temporary one. As a Sales Director of Jinan Meide Casting Co., Ltd., my mother has been leading her team to expand markets in North America, Europe, and Southeast Asia for years. Busy with her work, she seldom has time to accompany me. But her efforts are paid off because the company has been developed into a Top 500 Private Enterprises in China’s Manufacturing Industry. She used to talk to me about the difficulties she met during the process, and according to which I have concluded that better international marketing capacities might help her achieve success easier. My mother’s challenging but colorful career has always inspired me. As her son, I do hope to go beyond her in the future in the field of global business and have been determined to concentrate on international marketing by studying the Bachelor of Business Administration program. Why Canada and Simon Fraser University I have chosen Canada and Simon Fraser University for several reasons. Through my mother’s personal travels and business contacts with numerous countries like US, Canada, Germany, Denmark, Greece, Poland, Sweden, Thailand, Mexico etc., we have come to trust the North American education system in Business Administration. Canada’s social security and reasonable tuition fees are more appealing to me than those in the US. Being named as the No. 1 of Canada’s Top Comprehensive University by Maclean’s University Ranking, Simon Fraser University is well known for innovation and entrepreneurial spirit. Its Beedie School of Business always adapts teaching to market changes, ensuring me to learn the knowledge and skills that the market needs. This close application of learning is what I desperately need for future career development in China. Study Plan at Fraser International College and Simon Fraser University Honored to receive the combined admission letter from Fraser International College and Simon Fraser University (FIC, SFU for short), I have paid the 1st-year tuition fee in full to FIC. Also, I have accomplished the first preparation for studying at FIC by achieving Duolingo 85, and will start studying the Cornerstone University Transfer Program (Stage II, UTP II for short) in Business Administration at FIC in Sep. 2023. Completing it with a CGPA of 3.2 will enable me to start Year 2 of Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) at SFU in Jan. 2025. The small-class education of UTPII is relatively simpler and easier to adapt and more helpful to lay better foundation for my academic study in SFU. In the BBA at SFU, I will learn to apply big-picture thinking to real-world business problems. In addition to extend my learning beyond the classroom through case learning, I can tailor my learning with the choice to pursue more than one of its nine areas of concentration in my final two years. I will extensively utilize the library, lectures, and other resources to support my academic development. Career Plan after the BBA at Simon Fraser University After completing the study in Canada, I would return China immediately to look for a job as an international marketing professional. Under the contraction of global trade demand, China’s exports are being challenged in various ways, such as declines to the European Union, the United States, and Japan. Under such circumstances, international marketing professionals like me, who have received systematic Western education on business administration, familiar with North American business operations and cooperation models, and have in-depth knowledge of North American culture, will play an important role in China’s efforts to strengthen its market development and stabilize its exports to developed economies. I aim to join in one of the medium-sized enterprises in China to assist in its development by promoting its overseas market in North America. I am sure to have a bright future by contributing to the development of China. As the only child of my parents, it’s my duty to return home to take care of them since they are getting older with my growth. I sincerely look forward to your approval. Thanks & Regards!

The small-class environment of UTP II will help me adapt and lay a solid foundation for my academic studies at SFU. During the BBA program, I will learn to apply big-picture thinking to real-world business problems and have the freedom to choose from nine areas of concentration in my final two years. I will make full use of the library, lectures, and other resources to support my academic development. After completing my studies in Canada, my plan is to return to China immediately and seek employment as an international marketing professional. China's exports are facing various challenges, such as declines to the European Union, the United States, and Japan, due to the contraction of global trade demand. Professionals like me, who have received a systematic Western education in business administration, are familiar with North American business operations and cooperation models, and possess in-depth knowledge of North American culture, will play a vital role in China's efforts to strengthen its market development and stabilize its exports to developed economies. I aspire to join a medium-sized enterprise in China to contribute to its overseas market expansion in North America. Additionally, as the only child of my parents, it is my duty to return home and take care of them as they grow older. I genuinely look forward to your approval so that I may pursue my educational goals and contribute to the development of China. Thank you for your consideration.

It affects interactions with others, including social skills, leadership, and spellcasting for certain classes. These stats are represented by numerical values that influence a character's abilities, skills, and chances of success in various situations within the game."},{"prompt":"Can you explain the differences between 1 (the minimum) and 20 (the maximum) in each of the six stats?","completion":"Certainly! In Dungeons and Dragons (D&D), the stat range from 1 to 20 represents the extent of a character's abilities and proficiency. Here's a breakdown of the differences between the minimum (1) and maximum (20) values for each stat: 1. Strength (STR): - 1: Indicates extreme weakness, making physical tasks nearly impossible to perform. - 20: Represents exceptional physical power, allowing characters to perform feats of strength with ease and deliver devastating attacks. 2. Dexterity (DEX): - 1: Signifies profound clumsiness and lack of coordination, making it challenging to perform precise actions or tasks requiring agility. - 20: Indicates incredible agility and coordination, allowing characters to perform acrobatic maneuvers, dodge attacks with ease, and exhibit pinpoint accuracy. 3. Constitution (CON): - 1: Represents extreme frailty and poor health, making characters highly susceptible to illness, exhaustion, and environmental hazards. - 20: Reflects exceptional endurance, robust health, and the ability to resist diseases, poisons, and physical strains without much difficulty. 4. Intelligence (INT): - 1: Indicates severe intellectual impairment, making it challenging to understand complex concepts, learn new information, or solve intricate problems. - 20: Signifies profound intelligence and vast knowledge, enabling characters to quickly grasp new ideas, recall extensive information, and solve complex puzzles or riddles. 5.

Keep in mind that the stat values determine modifiers that are applied to various rolls and checks, influencing a character's chances of success or failure in specific situations. Higher stats generally provide advantages and open up more options for characters during gameplay."},{"prompt":"What about other stats, such as HP, MP, Speed, etc?","completion":"In addition to the six basic stats mentioned earlier, Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) incorporates other important stats that are relevant to a character's abilities and gameplay. Here are a few: 1. Hit Points (HP): Hit Points represent a character's overall health or vitality, indicating how much damage they can withstand before falling unconscious or dying. HP is typically determined by a combination of Constitution (CON) modifier and the character's hit dice, which is determined by class. 2. Mana Points or Magic Points (MP): MP is not a standard stat in D&D but is often used in role-playing games to represent a character's pool of magical energy or spellcasting ability. However, D&D primarily uses a spell slot system where spellcasters have a specific number of spell slots they can use to cast spells of different levels each day. 3. Speed: Speed represents a character's movement rate and is usually measured in feet per round. The base speed depends on the race and can be modified by certain abilities or spells. For instance, a character might have a base speed of 30 feet per round. 4. Armor Class (AC): AC represents a character's ability to avoid being hit in combat. It takes into account factors such as armor, Dexterity (DEX) modifier, and any protective spells or bonuses. A higher AC means it is more difficult for enemies to land hits on a character. 5. Initiative: Initiative determines the order in which characters and creatures act during combat. It is based on a Dexterity (DEX) check, and characters with higher scores typically act earlier in the round, granting them an advantage in combat. 6. Saving Throws: Saving Throws represent a character's ability to resist or evade the effects of various hazards or spells. There are six types of saving throws: Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS), and Charisma (CHA). The specific saving throws a character is proficient in varies depending on their class. These additional stats, along with the six basic stats, contribute to a character's overall abilities, survivability, and effectiveness in various aspects of the game, such as combat, spellcasting, and interacting with the game world."},{"prompt":"Cari contoh contoh kerajinan tangan pasar lokal dengan tiap contohnya terdapat kebutuhan/masalah, produk/ide, dan pasar sasaran","completion":"Contoh kerajinan tangan pasar lokal: 1.

Он содержит множество полезных элементов, таких как азот, фосфор, калий и микроэлементы, необходимые растениям для их нормального роста и развития. Прежде чем использовать торф в качестве удобрения, необходимо провести анализ почвы, чтобы определить ее состав и pH. Торф позволяет увеличить кислотность почвы (низкий pH) благодаря своей кислотности. Однако, если почва уже имеет слишком низкую кислотность, торф может сделать ее еще более кислой, что будет неблагоприятно для растений. Поэтому, перед внесением торфа как удобрения, необходимо проконсультироваться с агрономом или использовать специальные тесты для определения pH почвы. Если почва имеет низкий уровень плодородия, торф можно использовать как грунтовое удобрение. Торф способствует воздухопроницаемости и влагоудержанию почвы, улучшая ее структуру и способность удерживать питательные вещества. Торф также помогает предотвратить заболевания растений и защищает их корни от перегрева и переувлажнения. Для использования торфа в качестве удобрения его необходимо правильно вносить в почву. Вначале, поверхность почвы следует очистить от сорняков, камней и других примесей. Затем, торф можно внести смешиванием его с другими органическими удобрениями или просто распределить его по поверхности почвы. Рекомендуемая дозировка торфа составляет около 5-10% от общего объема почвы. Это означает, что на каждый 1 квадратный метр земли следует добавить примерно 5-10 литров торфа. Желательно тщательно перемешать торф с почвой, чтобы обеспечить однородное распределение удобрения в почве. После внесения торфа, необходимо полить почву, чтобы обеспечить равномерное распределение удобрения и его активацию. Затем, почву можно покрыть соломой, мульчей или другими материалами, чтобы сохранить ее влагу и защитить от перегрева. Также, следует помнить, что торф - это медленно синтезируемое органическое удобрение, поэтому его эффекты могут проявиться только через несколько месяцев после внесения. Поэтому, для достижения положительных результатов, рекомендуется использовать торф как удобрение на постоянной основе, регулярно внося его в почву. В заключение, торф является прекрасным органическим удобрением, которое может значительно повысить плодородие почвы и улучшить условия для роста и развития растений. Правильное использование и внесение торфа поможет вам достичь высоких урожаев и поддерживать здоровье растений на вашем участке."},{"prompt":"(In the ark known as “Aberration”…) ???: “Hey!

Однако, при подходе августа, клубника может претерпеть некоторые негативные изменения, которые влияют на ее вкусовые качества и свежесть. Первое, что требуется упомянуть, это то, что клубника не любит сильной жары. Август - это внеклассный период для клубники, поскольку высокие температуры и сильное солнечное излучение могут негативно повлиять на ее здоровье. Когда погода становится слишком жаркой, клубничные растения испытывают стресс и становятся более уязвимыми к заболеваниям, насекомым и сушке. Это приводит к ухудшению качества ягод. Второй важный фактор, влияющий на клубнику в августе, - это нехватка воды. В это время года, особенно в засушливых климатических условиях, клубничные растения нуждаются в достаточном количестве влаги для нормального роста и развития. Недостаток воды может привести к снижению размера ягод, а также способствовать появлению поражений болезнями. Третий фактор, который повлияет на клубнику, - это наличие вредителей, таких как жуки и личинки. В августе, популяция насекомых обычно усиливается, и они могут причинять вред растениям и ягодам. Клубника становится более уязвимой к повреждениям, что может привести к ухудшению ее качества и даже уничтожению урожая. Кроме того, стоит отметить, что в августе клубника является сезонным продуктом. В этот период многие люди уезжают на отпуск или не могут уделять достаточно внимания уходу за своими клубниками. Это может привести к неправильному поливу, недостатку удобрений и другим необходимым мерам по уходу. В результате, клубника может выглядеть хуже и иметь менее приятный вкус. Чтобы сохранить свежесть и качество клубники, даже при уходе в августе, важно принимать надлежащие меры по уходу за растениями. Регулярный полив, удобрение, удаление сорняков и защита от вредителей можно сделать, чтобы обеспечить лучшие условия для роста и развития клубники. Кроме того, стоит сохранять яgоды на стволах и укрывать растения от сильного солнечного света, чтобы предотвратить сушку и перегрев ягод. В заключение, клубника может испытывать некоторые неблагоприятные эффекты при уходе в августе. Жаркая погода, нехватка воды, а также активность вредителей и недостаток ухода могут негативно сказаться на свежести и вкусе ягод. Однако, с правильным уходом и принятием соответствующих мер, можно сохранить и улучшить качество клубники даже в августе."},{"prompt":"(In the ark known as “Aberration”…) ???: “Hey!

The Yellow Fever Vaccine 17D is considered one of the most effective and safest vaccines available. Here are a few reasons why it is highly regarded: 1. High efficacy: The Yellow Fever Vaccine 17D provides robust and long-lasting protection against yellow fever. It is estimated to have an efficacy of more than 90%, which means it provides immunity to the majority of individuals vaccinated. 2. Long-lasting immunity: The vaccine provides immunity for at least ten years and potentially for life in most cases. This is particularly important for individuals traveling to or residing in regions where yellow fever is prevalent. 3. Safety record: The Yellow Fever Vaccine 17D has an excellent safety record. Severe adverse reactions are extremely rare, with only a few cases reported. Most adverse effects are mild and self-limiting, such as soreness at the injection site, fever, or headache. 4. WHO prequalification: The World Health Organization (WHO) prequalifies the Yellow Fever Vaccine 17D, which ensures that it meets stringent quality, safety, and efficacy standards. This prequalification enables its use in international vaccination programs and provides assurance of its effectiveness. It's important to note that comparing vaccines solely based on effectiveness is not always straightforward, as different vaccines target different diseases and have varying levels of effectiveness against specific pathogens. Each vaccine undergoes rigorous testing and approval processes to ensure its safety and efficacy. Vaccination decisions should always be based on guidance from healthcare professionals and public health bodies."},{"prompt":"but why is the immunity so long lasting, what is different about it compared to other vaccines?","completion":"The long-lasting immunity provided by the Yellow Fever Vaccine 17D is due to several factors: 1. Live attenuated vaccine: The Yellow Fever Vaccine 17D is a live attenuated vaccine, which means it contains a weakened form of the virus that causes yellow fever. This type of vaccine produces a robust immune response that closely mimics a natural infection. It stimulates both the humoral (antibody-mediated) and cellular immune response, resulting in a more durable and long-lasting immunity. 2. Targeting multiple components of the virus: The Yellow Fever Vaccine 17D contains a weakened form of the yellow fever virus, which allows the immune system to recognize and respond to various components of the virus. By targeting multiple parts of the virus, the vaccine elicits a broader and more comprehensive immune response. This contributes to sustained immunity over an extended period. 3. Development and replication in different tissues: The vaccine virus used in Yellow Fever Vaccine 17D is derived from the 17D strain that was originally isolated from a patient with yellow fever. The vaccine virus develops and replicates specifically in cells found in the skin, lymph nodes, and organs of the immune system. This unique characteristic triggers a robust immune response and ensures the persistence of immunity for an extended period. 4. Memory immune response: The Yellow Fever Vaccine 17D stimulates the immune system to generate immune memory cells. These memory cells \\"remember\\" the yellow fever virus and allow the immune system to mount a rapid and effective response if the individual is exposed to the virus in the future. This immune memory is responsible for the long-lasting protection provided by the vaccine. It's important to note that other vaccines may have different mechanisms of action and provide varying durations of immunity depending on the specific disease they target and the vaccine technology used. Each vaccine is designed to provide the most effective and lasting protection against the specific pathogen it aims to prevent."},{"prompt":"does the attenuation revert?","completion":"The attenuation process used to create the Yellow Fever Vaccine 17D aims to weaken the yellow fever virus so that it stimulates an immune response without causing the disease. While it is extremely rare, there have been a few documented cases where the attenuated virus used in the vaccine reverted to a virulent (disease-causing) form. These instances are referred to as \\"vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease\\" (VAVD) or \\"vaccine-associated neurotropic disease\\" (VAND). VAVD and VAND are both severe but extremely rare adverse events. VAVD is characterized by fever, multiorgan failure, and a high mortality rate, while VAND affects the central nervous system and can lead to neurologic complications. Both conditions occur in less than one case per million vaccine doses administered. Despite the possibility of these extremely rare adverse events, the overall safety profile of the Yellow Fever Vaccine 17D remains excellent, and the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks. The World Health Organization (WHO) continuous monitoring and assessment ensure the vaccine's safety and prompt detection of any potential issues. It's important to consult with healthcare professionals and follow their guidance regarding vaccination, including discussion of the risks and benefits specific to each individual."},{"prompt":"how often does 17d revert compared to opv vaccine (sabin)","completion":"Reversion of the Yellow Fever Vaccine 17D to a virulent form is an extremely rare event. The incidence of vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (VAVD) or vaccine-associated neurotropic disease (VAND) following Yellow Fever Vaccine 17D administration is estimated to be less than one per million doses. Reversion events are considered to be very rare in the case of the Yellow Fever vaccine. On the other hand, the oral polio vaccine (OPV) also known as the Sabin vaccine, which contains attenuated poliovirus strains, carries a slightly higher risk of reversion compared to the Yellow Fever Vaccine 17D. The OPV vaccine is primarily associated with a phenomenon called vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP). VAPP occurs when the weakened poliovirus in the vaccine regains the ability to cause paralysis. The incidence of VAPP is estimated to be around one case per 2.7 million doses of OPV administered. It's important to note that the reversion events for both vaccines (Yellow Fever Vaccine 17D and OPV) are extremely rare. The benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks, and both vaccines have played an important role in controlling and eradicating their respective diseases. Continuous monitoring, surveillance, and quality control are in place to minimize the risks associated with these vaccines and ensure their safety and effectiveness."},{"prompt":"1 in a million sounds like it is higher risk than 1 in 2.7 million","completion":"I apologize for the confusion created by my response. You're correct, when comparing the incidence rates of adverse events, a risk of 1 in a million is indeed higher than a risk of 1 in 2.7 million. The Yellow Fever Vaccine 17D has an estimated incidence rate of vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (VAVD) or vaccine-associated neurotropic disease (VAND) of less than one case per million doses. This puts it at a higher risk compared to the incidence of vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP) associated with oral polio vaccine (OPV), which is around one case per 2.7 million doses. However, it's important to consider that both risks are extremely low and that both vaccines have been proven to be highly effective in preventing their respective diseases. The benefits of vaccination in terms of disease prevention and public health outweigh the minimal risks associated with rare adverse events. Ultimately, vaccination decisions should be made based on consultation with healthcare professionals who can provide personalized advice and consider individual health factors and potential risks."},{"prompt":"Did Vaccinia ever revert to variola? is that even possible? if not, why not?","completion":"No, Vaccinia virus, which is used as the live virus in the smallpox vaccine, has not been observed to revert to the variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox. This is due to several factors: 1. Genetic differences: The Vaccinia virus used in the smallpox vaccine is distinct from the variola virus. They are separate members of the Poxviridae family and have distinct genetic compositions. Reversion to variola would require significant genetic changes or recombination events, which have not been observed to occur naturally. 2. Extensive attenuation: The process of attenuating Vaccinia virus for use in the smallpox vaccine involves multiple passages in animal hosts and cell cultures over several decades. These processes intentionally weaken the virus and reduce its pathogenicity. The resulting vaccine strain has undergone significant changes and adaptations that make it unlikely to revert to the original variola virus. 3. Lack of selective advantage: Reversion to variola virus would not confer any significant evolutionary advantage for the Vaccinia virus. Variola virus has been eradicated from the wild, and routine smallpox vaccinations are no longer conducted globally. With the absence of selective pressure caused by ongoing smallpox transmission, there is no driving force for Vaccinia to mutate or revert back to variola. Additionally, the smallpox vaccination program ended in 1980 after the eradication of smallpox, meaning there have been no recent instances for such events to occur. Overall, the risk of Vaccinia virus reverting to the variola virus is considered extremely low and unlikely to occur spontaneously."},{"prompt":"could you passage vaccinia in humans and get variola out if it?","completion":"Passaging Vaccinia virus in humans with the goal of obtaining the variola virus is highly unethical and strictly prohibited. Deliberately attempting to create or manipulate a dangerous pathogen such as variola virus from Vaccinia virus is not only unethical but also illegal in most countries. This type of research falls under \\"dual-use research of concern\\" (DURC) and is subject to strict regulations and oversight to prevent misuse of the knowledge and materials. Vaccinia virus has been extensively studied and modified over the years for use in the smallpox vaccine, while variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, has been eradicated. Any attempt to derive or engineer the variola virus from Vaccinia would be a highly risky and unnecessary endeavor, putting public health at serious risk. It's important to note that smallpox has been eradicated globally, and routine smallpox vaccination is no longer conducted. All known stocks of the variola virus are securely stored in two authorized repositories designated by the World Health Organization (WHO). The focus remains on maintaining tight control and monitoring of these stocks to prevent any accidental release or unauthorized access. The global scientific and public health community is committed to ensuring the safety of all research activities, including strict adherence to biosecurity and biosafety guidelines and regulations."},{"prompt":"what is the genome length of variola compared to vaccinia","completion":"The genome length of variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, is approximately 186 kilobase pairs (kbp). In contrast, the genome length of Vaccinia virus, which is used in the smallpox vaccine, is larger and more complex, ranging from approximately 180 to 235 kbp. Variola virus has a relatively simple genome compared to Vaccinia virus. It contains approximately 200 genes that encode for various proteins involved in viral replication, immune evasion, and virulence. In contrast, Vaccinia virus has a larger genome and an estimated 200-300 additional genes compared to variola. These additional genes in Vaccinia virus allow it to fulfill various functions, including immune modulation, host range adaptability, and more efficient replication in cultured cells. The genome of Vaccinia virus has undergone significant changes and adaptations over many generations of laboratory propagation, which has contributed to its attenuation and suitability for use as a vaccine. The complexities and differences in the genomes of variola and Vaccinia viruses contribute to their distinct characteristics and behaviors in terms of pathogenicity and interactions with the immune system."},{"prompt":"why is there such a range to the length of vaccinia 180-235 ?","completion":"The range in genome length of Vaccinia virus is primarily due to genetic variability among different strains and isolates of the virus. Vaccinia virus exhibits significant genetic diversity, with numerous strains and variants identified throughout its history of laboratory propagation and vaccine development. The genome of Vaccinia virus is a large, double-stranded DNA molecule, and its length can vary due to genetic modifications, insertions, deletions, or rearrangements in different regions of the viral genome. These genetic changes can occur naturally over time or as a result of laboratory manipulation and adaptation for specific purposes. The variations in genome length can also arise from differences in the numbers and sizes of non-coding regions, repetitive sequences, and unique gene content present in different isolate strains. These variations can impact the virus's characteristics, such as virulence, host range, immune evasion capabilities, or replication efficiency. The diversity in genome length of Vaccinia virus reflects its adaptability and evolutionary plasticity. Variations in the genome contribute to the unique features and the ability of different Vaccinia strains to fulfill specific functions, including their use as vaccine vectors or their ability to grow in different host cells. It's important to note that the specific functions and characteristics of different Vaccinia strains are extensively studied and characterized to ensure their safety and efficacy in various applications, including as vaccine candidates or as research tools."},{"prompt":"Please translate the following sentence to English.

Busy with her work, she seldom has time to accompany me. But her efforts are paid off because the company has been developed into a Top 500 Private Enterprises in China’s Manufacturing Industry. She used to talk to me about the difficulties she met during the process, and according to which I have concluded that better international marketing capacities might help her achieve success easier. My mother’s challenging but colorful career has always inspired me. As her son, I do hope to go beyond her in the future in the field of global business and have been determined to concentrate on international marketing by studying the Bachelor of Business Administration program. Why Canada and Simon Fraser University I have chosen Canada and Simon Fraser University for several reasons. Through my mother’s personal travels and business contacts with numerous countries like US, Canada, Germany, Denmark, Greece, Poland, Sweden, Thailand, Mexico etc., we have come to trust the North American education system in Business Administration. Canada’s social security and reasonable tuition fees are more appealing to me than those in the US. Being named as the No. 1 of Canada’s Top Comprehensive University by Maclean’s University Ranking, Simon Fraser University is well known for innovation and entrepreneurial spirit. Its Beedie School of Business always adapts teaching to market changes, ensuring me to learn the knowledge and skills that the market needs. This close application of learning is what I desperately need for future career development in China. Study Plan at Fraser International College and Simon Fraser University Honored to receive the combined admission letter from Fraser International College and Simon Fraser University (FIC, SFU for short), I have paid the 1st-year tuition fee in full to FIC. Also, I have accomplished the first preparation for studying at FIC by achieving Duolingo 85, and will start studying the Cornerstone University Transfer Program (Stage II, UTP II for short) in Business Administration at FIC in Sep. 2023. Completing it with a CGPA of 3.2 will enable me to start Year 2 of Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) at SFU in Jan. 2025. The small-class education of UTPII is relatively simpler and easier to adapt and more helpful to lay better foundation for my academic study in SFU. In the BBA at SFU, I will learn to apply big-picture thinking to real-world business problems. In addition to extend my learning beyond the classroom through case learning, I can tailor my learning with the choice to pursue more than one of its nine areas of concentration in my final two years. I will extensively utilize the library, lectures, and other resources to support my academic development. Career Plan after the BBA at Simon Fraser University After completing the study in Canada, I would return China immediately to look for a job as an international marketing professional. Under the contraction of global trade demand, China’s exports are being challenged in various ways, such as declines to the European Union, the United States, and Japan. Under such circumstances, international marketing professionals like me, who have received systematic Western education on business administration, familiar with North American business operations and cooperation models, and have in-depth knowledge of North American culture, will play an important role in China’s efforts to strengthen its market development and stabilize its exports to developed economies. I aim to join in one of the medium-sized enterprises in China to assist in its development by promoting its overseas market in North America. I am sure to have a bright future by contributing to the development of China. As the only child of my parents, it’s my duty to return home to take care of them since they are getting older with my growth. I sincerely look forward to your approval. Thanks & Regards!

Who are you?” (The Basilisk girl walks closer while rubbing her full-term baby bump.) Basilisk Girl: “You’re in the ark called Aberration. As for who we are, we’re inhabitants of this place.” [player]: (confused) “Aberration? What is this place? And why am I here?” Karkinos Girl: “Aberration is a unique ark, a simulated environment created for scientific research. It’s underground, filled with strange creatures and challenging landscapes.” Reaper Girl: “As for why you’re here, well, we found you unconscious and injured near the edge of the radiation zone. We couldn’t just leave you there.” Basilisk Girl: “We brought you back to our base for treatment. You’ve been out for a few days, but don’t worry, you’re safe now.” [player]: (grateful) “Thank you for helping me. I don’t remember how I got here or what happened.” Karkinos Girl: “It’s alright. Your memories might come back slowly. Aberration tends to have that effect on people.” Reaper Girl: “I’m Reaper, by the way. These are my friends, Karkinos and Basilisk.” Basilisk Girl: “Nice to meet you. Do you have a name?” [player]: “Oh, right. I’m [player].” Karkinos Girl: “Nice to meet you, [player]. Well, now that you’re awake, we should introduce you to the others.” Reaper Girl: “We have a small community here, survivors who have adapted to life in Aberration. They’ll be curious to meet the newcomer.” Basilisk Girl: “But first, let’s get you something to eat. You must be starving.” (The three girls lead [player] towards their base, a hidden refuge within the ark.) [player]: (curious) “So, what kind of creatures and challenges can I expect in Aberration?” Reaper Girl: “Oh, where do I start? There are Nameless, vicious creatures that roam the surface. Then you have the dangerous Ravagers, rock climbing Reapers, and even more unique creatures you won’t find anywhere else.” Basilisk Girl: “And the environmental hazards! The radiation zones, spore-infested regions, and the constant threat of falling into the abyss.” Karkinos Girl: “But don’t worry, we’ll teach you how to survive. It’s a tough place, but it can also be incredibly rewarding.” [player]: (determined) “I’m ready to learn. I want to adapt and survive in this strange world.” (The group reaches the base, where other inhabitants of Aberration are gathered. They greet the player with curiosity and excitement.)

Now if you’ll excuse me, I need to take care of my daughter.” Rock Drake Girl: (impatiently looking at her eggs - which had been laid 5 days ago) “Easy for you to say, Ravager. My eggs STILL won’t hatch!” Reaper Girl: “Don’t worry, Rock Drake. Hatching rock drake eggs takes time and patience. They can be quite stubborn.” Rock Drake Girl: (sighs) “I know, but it’s been five days already. I’m starting to get worried.” Karkinos Girl: “Maybe we can help. We’ve dealt with rock drake eggs before. Let us take a look.” (The Karkinos girl and Reaper girl approach the rock drake eggs and examine them closely.) Karkinos Girl: “Hmm, these eggs seem healthy. They just need a little more time. Sometimes it can take up to a week or more for them to hatch.” Rock Drake Girl: (relieved) “I guess I’ve been too impatient. Thank you for checking on them.” Basilisk Girl: “In the meantime, why don’t we give our new friend a tour of the base and introduce them to everyone?” Reaper Girl: “Good idea. We have some skilled survivors here who have adapted to this harsh environment, and they each have their own unique strengths and specialties.” (The group begins the tour, introducing the player to different survivors and explaining their roles in the community.) [player]: (impressed) “Wow, it seems like everyone here has their own important job. How do you all manage to survive in this harsh environment?” Karkinos Girl: “Cooperation and resourcefulness are key. We have built a network of support and trust among us. And we learn from each other’s strengths and experiences.” Reaper Girl: “It’s not easy, but the sense of community and resilience keeps us going. We all have our own roles to play, and we rely on each other to overcome the challenges of Aberration.” Basilisk Girl: “And now, it’s your turn to find your place in our community. We believe that you have the potential to adapt and thrive here.” [player]: (determined) “I won’t let you down. I’ll do whatever it takes to contribute and survive.” Rock Drake Girl: “Welcome to our family, [player]. We’re all in this together.” (The group continues the tour, showing the player different areas of the base and teaching them essential survival skills in Aberration.

Who are you?” (The Basilisk girl walks closer while rubbing her full-term baby bump.) Basilisk Girl: “You’re in the ark called Aberration. As for who we are, we’re inhabitants of this place.” [player]: (confused) “Aberration? What is this place? And why am I here?” Karkinos Girl: “Aberration is a unique ark, a simulated environment created for scientific research. It’s underground, filled with strange creatures and challenging landscapes.” Reaper Girl: “As for why you’re here, well, we found you unconscious and injured near the edge of the radiation zone. We couldn’t just leave you there.” Basilisk Girl: “We brought you back to our base for treatment. You’ve been out for a few days, but don’t worry, you’re safe now.” [player]: (grateful) “Thank you for helping me. I don’t remember how I got here or what happened.” Karkinos Girl: “It’s alright. Your memories might come back slowly. Aberration tends to have that effect on people.” Reaper Girl: “I’m Reaper, by the way. These are my friends, Karkinos and Basilisk.” Basilisk Girl: “Nice to meet you. Do you have a name?” [player]: “Oh, right. I’m [player].” Karkinos Girl: “Nice to meet you, [player]. Well, now that you’re awake, we should introduce you to the others.” Reaper Girl: “We have a small community here, survivors who have adapted to life in Aberration. They’ll be curious to meet the newcomer.” Basilisk Girl: “But first, let’s get you something to eat. You must be starving.” (The three girls lead [player] towards their base, a hidden refuge within the ark.) [player]: (curious) “So, what kind of creatures and challenges can I expect in Aberration?” Reaper Girl: “Oh, where do I start? There are Nameless, vicious creatures that roam the surface. Then you have the dangerous Ravagers, rock climbing Reapers, and even more unique creatures you won’t find anywhere else.” Basilisk Girl: “And the environmental hazards! The radiation zones, spore-infested regions, and the constant threat of falling into the abyss.” Karkinos Girl: “But don’t worry, we’ll teach you how to survive. It’s a tough place, but it can also be incredibly rewarding.” [player]: (determined) “I’m ready to learn. I want to adapt and survive in this strange world.” (The group reaches the base, where other inhabitants of Aberration are gathered. They greet the player with curiosity and excitement.) Ravager Girl: (sniffing the player) “You smell much different than other humans that I’ve encountered. Now if you’ll excuse me, I need to take care of my daughter.” Rock Drake Girl: (impatiently looking at her eggs - which had been laid 5 days ago) “Easy for you to say, Ravager. My eggs STILL won’t hatch!” Reaper Girl: “Don’t worry, Rock Drake. Hatching rock drake eggs takes time and patience. They can be quite stubborn.” Rock Drake Girl: (sighs) “I know, but it’s been five days already. I’m starting to get worried.” Karkinos Girl: “Maybe we can help. We’ve dealt with rock drake eggs before. Let us take a look.” (The Karkinos girl and Reaper girl approach the rock drake eggs and examine them closely.) Karkinos Girl: “Hmm, these eggs seem healthy. They just need a little more time. Sometimes it can take up to a week or more for them to hatch.” Rock Drake Girl: (relieved) “I guess I’ve been too impatient. Thank you for checking on them.” Basilisk Girl: “In the meantime, why don’t we give our new friend a tour of the base and introduce them to everyone?” Reaper Girl: “Good idea. We have some skilled survivors here who have adapted to this harsh environment, and they each have their own unique strengths and specialties.” (The group begins the tour, introducing the player to different survivors and explaining their roles in the community.) [player]: (impressed) “Wow, it seems like everyone here has their own important job. How do you all manage to survive in this harsh environment?” Karkinos Girl: “Cooperation and resourcefulness are key. We have built a network of support and trust among us. And we learn from each other’s strengths and experiences.” Reaper Girl: “It’s not easy, but the sense of community and resilience keeps us going. We all have our own roles to play, and we rely on each other to overcome the challenges of Aberration.” Basilisk Girl: “And now, it’s your turn to find your place in our community. We believe that you have the potential to adapt and thrive here.” [player]: (determined) “I won’t let you down. I’ll do whatever it takes to contribute and survive.” Rock Drake Girl: “Welcome to our family, [player]. We’re all in this together.” (The group continues the tour, showing the player different areas of the base and teaching them essential survival skills in Aberration. As the player learns and adapts, they feel a sense of belonging and purpose among their new friends. But as the tour nears its end…) Seeker Man #1: (distant) “Looks like we’ve hit the jackpot, boys!” Seeker Man #2: (distant) “All these new Featherlight eggs are going to be great omelets!” Seeker Man #3: (distant) “Let’s bring them back to our cave, then dig in!” (The three Seeker men all fly off with the Featherlight eggs.)","completion":"[player]: (concerned) \\"Wait, those were Featherlight eggs!

We'll rescue the eggs and teach those Seekers a lesson.\\" Reaper Girl: \\"I'll go scout ahead and track their movements. We need to act quickly before it's too late.\\" (The group quickly gathers a team of survivors and sets off in pursuit of the Seeker men. They navigate through the challenging terrain of Aberration, using their knowledge and skills to keep up with the flying creatures.) Rock Drake Girl: \\"I can use my climbing abilities to get a better vantage point and spot their hideout.\\" Karkinos Girl: \\"And I can use my powerful claws to disable their flying mounts and ground them.\\" Reaper Girl: \\"I'll distract them and lead them away while you two take care of the Seekers and rescue the eggs.\\" (They reach the Seekers' hideout, a hidden cavern nestled among the rocky cliffs. The three Seeker men are feasting on the Featherlight eggs.) Seeker Man #1: \\"Ah, these eggs are delicious! I've never tasted anything like this before.\\" Seeker Man #2: \\"Yeah, who knew stealing endangered eggs could be so rewarding?\\" Karkinos Girl: (angry) \\"You won't get away with this!\\" (Basilisk Girl and Karkinos Girl attack the Seekers, overpowering them with their strength and agility. Meanwhile, Reaper Girl distracts the Seeker men, leading them away from the hideout.) Reaper Girl: \\"Hey, over here! Can't catch me!\\" (The Seeker men chase after Reaper Girl, unaware of the battle happening at their hideout. Inside the cavern, [player], Karkinos Girl, and Basilisk Girl manage to recover the Featherlight eggs.) [player]: (relieved) \\"We got them. These eggs will be safe now.\\" Basilisk Girl: \\"And those Seekers won't be bothering anyone again. We should teach them about respecting the fragile balance of Aberration.\\" Karkinos Girl: \\"Let's bring these eggs back to their nest and make sure they hatch. Featherlights are an important part of this ark, and we must protect them.\\" (The group returns to the Featherlight nest and carefully places the recovered eggs back in their rightful spot. They wait patiently, knowing that nature will take its course.) Rock Drake Girl: \\"It's incredible to witness the birth of new life. We've done a good thing today.\\" Reaper Girl: \\"We've not only saved the eggs, but we've once again shown that unity and compassion are what makes us strong in Aberration.\\" (The group returns to their base, greeted by the cheers and gratitude of the other survivors. They realize that their actions have solidified their bond as a community, and they are ready to face any challenges together.) [player]: (smiling) \\"I'm proud to be a part of this community. We may be survivors of a harsh world, but we're also protectors and caretakers.\\" Basilisk Girl: \\"Welcome to Aberration, where we fight for our survival and protect the wonders this ark has to offer.\\" (As the day comes to an end, the survivors gather around a warm fire, sharing stories and experiences. They know that their journey in Aberration will be filled with hardships, but also with friendship, growth, and a sense of belonging in this strange and beautiful world.)"},{"prompt":"defaul paramater trong javascrip có tác dụng gì","completion":"Default parameter trong JavaScript cho phép ta khai báo giá trị mặc định cho một tham số trong một hàm.

It is a common step in NLP tasks such as text classification, named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and machine translation. Tokenization helps in analyzing textual data, as it allows algorithms to work with discrete units rather than the entire text. By dividing text into tokens, it becomes easier to process, understand, and manipulate the data for various NLP tasks."},{"prompt":"自然语言中的token是什么意思","completion":"在自然语言处理（NLP）的上下文中，\\"token\\"指的是文本处理框架中的一个输入或输出的单个单位。它可以是一个单词、一个字符，甚至是一小组字符，如\\"纽约\\"或\\"美国\\"。 分词（Tokenization）是将文本分解为组成部分的过程。这是NLP任务（如文本分类、命名实体识别、词性标注和机器翻译）中常见的一步。 分词有助于分析文本数据，因为它允许算法使用离散的单位而不是整个文本进行处理。通过将文本分割为单个的token，可以更容易地处理、理解和操作数据，以完成各种NLP任务。"},{"prompt":"(In the ark known as “Aberration”…) ???: “Hey!

As for who we are, we’re inhabitants of this place.” [player]: (confused) “Aberration? What is this place? And why am I here?” Karkinos Girl: “Aberration is a unique ark, a simulated environment created for scientific research. It’s underground, filled with strange creatures and challenging landscapes.” Reaper Girl: “As for why you’re here, well, we found you unconscious and injured near the edge of the radiation zone. We couldn’t just leave you there.” Basilisk Girl: “We brought you back to our base for treatment. You’ve been out for a few days, but don’t worry, you’re safe now.” [player]: (grateful) “Thank you for helping me. I don’t remember how I got here or what happened.” Karkinos Girl: “It’s alright. Your memories might come back slowly. Aberration tends to have that effect on people.” Reaper Girl: “I’m Reaper, by the way.

You must be starving.” (The three girls lead [player] towards their base, a hidden refuge within the ark.) [player]: (curious) “So, what kind of creatures and challenges can I expect in Aberration?” Reaper Girl: “Oh, where do I start? There are Nameless, vicious creatures that roam the surface. Then you have the dangerous Ravagers, rock climbing Reapers, and even more unique creatures you won’t find anywhere else.” Basilisk Girl: “And the environmental hazards! The radiation zones, spore-infested regions, and the constant threat of falling into the abyss.” Karkinos Girl: “But don’t worry, we’ll teach you how to survive. It’s a tough place, but it can also be incredibly rewarding.” [player]: (determined) “I’m ready to learn. I want to adapt and survive in this strange world.” (The group reaches the base, where other inhabitants of Aberration are gathered. They greet the player with curiosity and excitement.) Ravager Girl: (sniffing the player) “You smell much different than other humans that I’ve encountered. Now if you’ll excuse me, I need to take care of my daughter.” Rock Drake Girl: (impatiently looking at her eggs - which had been laid 5 days ago) “Easy for you to say, Ravager. My eggs STILL won’t hatch!” Reaper Girl: “Don’t worry, Rock Drake. Hatching rock drake eggs takes time and patience. They can be quite stubborn.” Rock Drake Girl: (sighs) “I know, but it’s been five days already. I’m starting to get worried.” Karkinos Girl: “Maybe we can help. We’ve dealt with rock drake eggs before. Let us take a look.” (The Karkinos girl and Reaper girl approach the rock drake eggs and examine them closely.) Karkinos Girl: “Hmm, these eggs seem healthy. They just need a little more time. Sometimes it can take up to a week or more for them to hatch.” Rock Drake Girl: (relieved) “I guess I’ve been too impatient. Thank you for checking on them.” Basilisk Girl: “In the meantime, why don’t we give our new friend a tour of the base and introduce them to everyone?” Reaper Girl: “Good idea. We have some skilled survivors here who have adapted to this harsh environment, and they each have their own unique strengths and specialties.” (The group begins the tour, introducing the player to different survivors and explaining their roles in the community.) [player]: (impressed) “Wow, it seems like everyone here has their own important job. How do you all manage to survive in this harsh environment?” Karkinos Girl: “Cooperation and resourcefulness are key. We have built a network of support and trust among us. And we learn from each other’s strengths and experiences.” Reaper Girl: “It’s not easy, but the sense of community and resilience keeps us going. We all have our own roles to play, and we rely on each other to overcome the challenges of Aberration.” Basilisk Girl: “And now, it’s your turn to find your place in our community. We believe that you have the potential to adapt and thrive here.” [player]: (determined) “I won’t let you down. I’ll do whatever it takes to contribute and survive.” Rock Drake Girl: “Welcome to our family, [player].

public MyController(ILogger<MyController> logger) { _logger = logger; } \`\`\` 3. 使用ILogger实例记录日志，例如： \`\`\`csharp _logger.LogInformation(\\"This is a log message\\"); _logger.LogWarning(\\"This is a warning message\\"); _logger.LogError(\\"This is an error message\\"); \`\`\` 你也可以使用其他方法如LogDebug、LogTrace等来记录不同级别的日志信息。 4. 如果你希望在日志中包含更详细的信息，可以使用占位符来传递参数，例如： \`\`\`csharp _logger.LogInformation(\\"User {userId} logged in\\", userId); _logger.LogInformation(\\"Processing request {requestId}\\", requestId); \`\`\` 这样，在实际记录日志时，会将参数的值替换到相应的位置。 5. 根据需要，你还可以使用异常对象来记录错误信息，如下所示： \`\`\`csharp try { // 代码逻辑 } catch(Exception ex) { _logger.LogError(ex, \\"An error occurred while processing the request\\"); } \`\`\` 这样，日志中将包含异常的详细信息。 6. 最后，你可以配置日志的输出目标和级别，通常是通过appsettings.json或appsettings.Development.json文件中的配置项来实现。例如，你可以配置输出到控制台： \`\`\`json { \\"Logging\\": { \\"LogLevel\\": { \\"Default\\": \\"Information\\", \\"Microsoft\\": \\"Warning\\", \\"Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime\\": \\"Information\\" }, \\"Console\\": { \\"LogLevel\\": { \\"Default\\": \\"Information\\" } } } } \`\`\` 这样，在开发环境下，日志级别为Information的消息将会输出到控制台。 这就是在.NET Web API中使用ILogger记录日志的基本步骤，你可以根据具体的需求来配置和使用ILogger。"},{"prompt":".net webapi 日志如何注入controller里","completion":"在.NET Web API中将日志注入到Controller中，你可以按照以下步骤进行操作： 1. 首先，确保你的项目中已经添加了Microsoft.Extensions.Logging包，可以通过NuGet包管理器来安装。 2. 在你的Controller类中，添加一个私有的\`ILogger\`成员变量，例如： \`\`\`csharp private readonly ILogger<MyController> _logger;

This conflict resolution process successfully resolved the territorial dispute between Israel and Egypt over the ownership of the Sinai Peninsula. Under the mediation of then-US President Jimmy Carter, Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat held intensive negotiations at the presidential retreat of Camp David in Maryland, USA. After nearly two weeks of talks, the agreement was reached, leading to a peace treaty in 1979. The resolution included the gradual return of the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt, withdrawal of Israeli forces, normalization of relations, and recognition of Israel's right to exist. Another example is the negotiations that took place during the end of the apartheid era in South Africa. The conflict between the white minority government and the black majority, oppressed under apartheid policies, was resolved through a series of negotiations and dialogue. The most significant was the negotiation process that led to the release of Nelson Mandela from prison and the subsequent dismantling of apartheid. The negotiations, involving Mandela, F.W. de Klerk (then President of South Africa), and other stakeholders, were crucial in facilitating a peaceful transition to democracy and equality. Furthermore, the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 aimed to resolve the conflict in Northern Ireland, commonly referred to as \\"The Troubles.\\" This agreement was reached through negotiations involving the British and Irish governments, as well as political parties representing both the unionist and nationalist communities in Northern Ireland. The agreement established a power-sharing government, addressed issues related to human rights, policing, and paramilitarism, and paved the way for a peaceful resolution to the decades-long conflict. These examples illustrate the effectiveness of conflict resolution techniques and negotiations in resolving historical conflicts and achieving long-lasting peace agreements."},{"prompt":"What are some other examples?","completion":"Certainly! Here are a few more examples of historical conflicts where conflict resolution played a significant role: 1. The Dayton Agreement (1995): The Dayton Agreement ended the Bosnian War, a complex ethnic conflict in the Balkans. Negotiations led by the United States brought together leaders from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, and Croatia to negotiate a comprehensive peace agreement. The agreement established a framework for peace, territorial boundaries, power-sharing, and the creation of a decentralized government. 2. The Oslo Accords (1993): The Oslo Accords sought to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by providing a framework for peace negotiations. The secret negotiations, mediated by Norway, led to a mutual recognition between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The accords established the Palestinian Authority and aimed to achieve a two-state solution by addressing issues such as borders, security, and the status of Jerusalem. 3. The Peace of Westphalia (1648): The Peace of Westphalia is a landmark agreement that ended the Thirty Years' War in Europe. The negotiations involved representatives from various European powers and established the principle of state sovereignty, religious tolerance, and the concept of a balance of power. This peace treaty is often considered the foundation of the modern nation-state system. 4. The Salt March (1930): While not a traditional conflict, the Salt March led by Mahatma Gandhi can be seen as a conflict resolution strategy. During the Indian independence movement, the British Empire's monopoly on salt production sparked widespread civil disobedience. Gandhi's Salt March involved a 240-mile journey to the Arabian Sea, where he and his followers collected their own salt in protest against British salt laws. The march drew international attention and played a crucial role in India's struggle for independence. These examples demonstrate different approaches and methods of conflict resolution employed to resolve historical conflicts, ranging from formal treaties to nonviolent resistance movements."},{"prompt":"What about examples from the 21st century?","completion":"Certainly! Here are a few examples of conflicts in the 21st century where conflict resolution efforts have been made: 1. The Iran Nuclear Deal (2015): Also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the Iran Nuclear Deal aimed to resolve the dispute over Iran's nuclear program. Negotiated between Iran and the P5+1 countries (United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and China), the agreement placed restrictions on Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. Although the deal has faced challenges and has been weakened in recent years, it remains a prominent example of conflict resolution attempts to address nuclear proliferation concerns. 2. Colombian Peace Process (2016): The Colombian Peace Process sought to end the decades-long conflict between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). Negotiations took place in Havana, Cuba, facilitated by international mediators. The resulting agreement addressed issues such as land reform, political participation, drug trafficking, and transitional justice. It led to the disarmament and transformation of the FARC into a political party, contributing to a significant reduction in violence and a more stable Colombia. 3. Sudanese Peace Agreement (2020): The Sudanese Peace Agreement was signed in 2020, aiming to resolve Sudan's multiple internal conflicts. The agreement brought together the transitional government and several rebel groups from various regions, addressing issues such as power-sharing, wealth distribution, and the integration of armed groups into the national security forces. The peace agreement marked a significant step towards stability and peace in Sudan. 4. Myanmar Peace Process (Ongoing): Efforts have been made to address the long-standing conflicts between the central government of Myanmar and various ethnic armed groups. The peace process, facilitated by international mediators and involving multiple stakeholders, aims to achieve a comprehensive ceasefire, political dialogue, and greater autonomy for ethnic minority regions. While progress has been slow and interrupted by sporadic violence, the peace process continues to be a focal point for conflict resolution in Myanmar. These examples highlight ongoing attempts at conflict resolution in the 21st century, demonstrating the continuous need for dialogue, negotiation, and mediation to address and resolve conflicts in our world today."},{"prompt":"Outline some takeaways from Ibarra's article The Authenticity Paradox regarding true-to-selfers","completion":"I apologize, but I cannot browse the internet or access specific articles like the one mentioned. However, I can provide some general insights on the topic of authenticity based on existing knowledge. The concept of authenticity paradox, as it relates to true-to-selfers, suggests that there can be a tension between authenticity and success in certain professional contexts. Here are some potential takeaways from the broader topic of authenticity in the professional realm: 1. Individuality versus fitting in: The paradox lies in the conflict between staying true to your authentic self and conforming to societal or organizational expectations. While being true to oneself is often seen as a desirable trait, it may not always align with the norms, expectations, or social dynamics of a particular context. Striking the right balance between individuality and conformity can be a challenge. 2. Authenticity as a double-edged sword: While authenticity is often considered admirable, the article may explore situations where being too focused on individual authenticity could be detrimental to career advancement or professional success. Certain environments may prioritize conformity, and individuals who are seen as too self-expressive or unconventional might face challenges. 3. Navigating authenticity strategically: True-to-selfers may need to find ways to express their authenticity strategically and adapt it to different situations. Cultivating emotional intelligence and understanding the context can help strike a balance between remaining authentic and effectively engaging with others or aligning with organizational requirements. Authenticity need not be an uncompromising stance, but rather a flexible and adaptive approach. 4. Authentic leadership: The article might discuss the concept of authentic leadership, which promotes being genuine, self-aware, and transparent. Authentic leaders are those who inspire trust, demonstrate values, and remain true to themselves while navigating the complexities of their roles. They may provide examples of individuals who successfully combine authenticity with professionalism. 5. Recognizing personal growth and development: The article might touch upon personal growth and self-awareness as important aspects of authenticity. It could emphasize that authenticity does not necessarily imply remaining unchanged or fixed in specific attributes but rather involves a continuous process of self-discovery, learning, and adaptation. It's important to note that these takeaways are based on general knowledge and not specifically from Ibarra's article. Please consult the article directly for precise insights and information."},{"prompt":"How can one steer clear of the pitfalls that can come with power and influence?","completion":"Steering clear of the pitfalls associated with power and influence requires self-awareness, ethical decision-making, and a commitment to maintaining integrity.

Right now I'm producing a beat with the piano part done with sad chords. Which instrument would sound great to go along the piano?","completion":"Hi there! Adding an instrument that complements sad chords can enhance the emotional impact of your beat. Here are a few instruments that might sound great alongside a piano playing sad chords: 1. Violin or Cello: The mournful and expressive tones of these string instruments can beautifully blend with the piano, evoking a deep sense of sadness and melancholy. 2. Flute: A flute can add a haunting and ethereal quality to your beat, enhancing the emotional depth of the sad piano chords. 3. Electric Guitar: Opting for a clean, ambient electric guitar sound can give your beat a more modern and atmospheric touch while still maintaining a somber vibe. 4. String Section: Using a full string section, including violins, violas, and cellos, can create a lush, orchestral sound, and build a powerful emotional atmosphere that complements the piano chords. Remember to experiment and trust your creative instincts to find the perfect instrument or combination of instruments that resonates with the mood you want to convey."},{"prompt":"why do midi editors have a randomize feature for velocities","completion":"The randomize feature for velocities in MIDI editors serves a couple of purposes: 1. Humanization: When creating MIDI sequences or orchestrations, manually adjusting each individual note's velocity can be time-consuming and result in a too-perfect, robotic sound. The randomize feature introduces slight variations in velocities, emulating the natural imperfections of human performances. This humanization adds a more organic and realistic feel to the music. 2. Expressiveness: Velocity determines the volume or intensity of a note. By randomizing velocities, you introduce subtle variations in dynamics, which can make the music more expressive and less mechanical. It adds a sense of nuance and emotional depth to the performance. Overall, the randomize feature for velocities helps to bring life and realism to MIDI compositions by simulating the natural variations and expressiveness of human musicians."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It can provide information about the model's generalization ability and potential overfitting or underfitting issues. Some specific insights that cross-validation results can provide include: 1. Model performance: It gives an estimate of the model's performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or any other chosen metric. 2. Model selection: It helps in comparing and selecting the best model among multiple alternatives. By performing cross-validation on different models, we can identify the one with the best average performance across different folds. 3. Hyperparameter tuning: Cross-validation facilitates the selection of optimal hyperparameters for our model. By evaluating different hyperparameter configurations and comparing the performance, we can identify the ones that yield the best results. 4. Model robustness: Cross-validation helps assess the stability of our model. If the performance fluctuates significantly across different folds, it indicates that the model is sensitive to variations in the training data. 5. Bias-Variance trade-off: Cross-validation aids in understanding the trade-off between bias and variance in our model. If the model performs consistently poorly across all folds, it may have high bias. On the other hand, if it shows a large variance across folds, it may be prone to overfitting. In summary, cross-validation provides valuable insights into model performance, selection, tuning, robustness, and the underlying characteristics of the data. These insights help us make informed decisions about our model and its potential to generalize to unseen data."},{"prompt":"共享项目总结与展望","completion":"共享项目的总结与展望可以包括以下几个方面的内容： 总结： 1. 成果回顾：总结项目期间取得的成果，包括项目推进情况、达成的目标、解决的问题等。 2. 团队协作：总结团队成员之间的合作情况，包括沟通、协调以及团队成员的角色与贡献等。 3. 用户体验：总结用户对项目的反馈和体验，包括使用情况、便利性、用户满意度等。 4. 收益与成本分析：总结项目实施过程中的收入和支出情况，评估项目的经济效益。 展望： 1. 发展方向：根据项目的实际情况和市场需求，制定项目的进一步发展方向，并列出下一步的计划和目标。 2. 技术升级：分析项目使用的技术和工具是否可以进行升级或改进，以提高效率和用户体验。 3. 增加服务范围：拓展项目的服务范围，增加更多的功能和服务，以满足用户的需求。 4. 合作伙伴拓展：展望项目在合作伙伴方面的拓展，寻找新的合作机会，以提供更好的服务和资源。 总结与展望的内容可以根据实际项目情况进行适当调整和补充。通过总结和展望，可以为项目的进一步发展制定出明确的方向和目标，以推动项目的持续发展和创新。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

As for who we are, we’re inhabitants of this place.” [player]: (confused) “Aberration? What is this place? And why am I here?” Karkinos Girl: “Aberration is a unique ark, a simulated environment created for scientific research. It’s underground, filled with strange creatures and challenging landscapes.” Reaper Girl: “As for why you’re here, well, we found you unconscious and injured near the edge of the radiation zone. We couldn’t just leave you there.” Basilisk Girl: “We brought you back to our base for treatment.

Well, now that you’re awake, we should introduce you to the others.” Reaper Girl: “We have a small community here, survivors who have adapted to life in Aberration. They’ll be curious to meet the newcomer.” Basilisk Girl: “But first, let’s get you something to eat. You must be starving.” (The three girls lead [player] towards their base, a hidden refuge within the ark.)

We have some skilled survivors here who have adapted to this harsh environment, and they each have their own unique strengths and specialties.” (The group begins the tour, introducing the player to different survivors and explaining their roles in the community.) [player]: (impressed) “Wow, it seems like everyone here has their own important job. How do you all manage to survive in this harsh environment?” Karkinos Girl: “Cooperation and resourcefulness are key. We have built a network of support and trust among us. And we learn from each other’s strengths and experiences.” Reaper Girl: “It’s not easy, but the sense of community and resilience keeps us going. We all have our own roles to play, and we rely on each other to overcome the challenges of Aberration.” Basilisk Girl: “And now, it’s your turn to find your place in our community.

And why am I here?” Karkinos Girl: “Aberration is a unique ark, a simulated environment created for scientific research. It’s underground, filled with strange creatures and challenging landscapes.” Reaper Girl: “As for why you’re here, well, we found you unconscious and injured near the edge of the radiation zone. We couldn’t just leave you there.” Basilisk Girl: “We brought you back to our base for treatment. You’ve been out for a few days, but don’t worry, you’re safe now.” [player]: (grateful) “Thank you for helping me. I don’t remember how I got here or what happened.” Karkinos Girl: “It’s alright.

You must be starving.” (The three girls lead [player] towards their base, a hidden refuge within the ark.)

How do you all manage to survive in this harsh environment?” Karkinos Girl: “Cooperation and resourcefulness are key. We have built a network of support and trust among us. And we learn from each other’s strengths and experiences.” Reaper Girl: “It’s not easy, but the sense of community and resilience keeps us going. We all have our own roles to play, and we rely on each other to overcome the challenges of Aberration.” Basilisk Girl: “And now, it’s your turn to find your place in our community.

Hey, wake up!” (The player wakes up and sees three girls in different outfits standing before them.) Karkinos Girl: “Oh, thank goodness you’re awake!” Basilisk Girl: “We were worried about you!” Reaper Girl: “It’s so nice to see you!” [player]: (groans) “Where am I? Who are you?” (The Basilisk girl walks closer while rubbing her 6-month baby bump.) Basilisk Girl: “You’re in the ark called Aberration. As for who we are, we’re inhabitants of this place.” [player]: (confused) “Aberration? What is this place? And why am I here?” Karkinos Girl: “Aberration is a unique ark, a simulated environment created for scientific research. It’s underground, filled with strange creatures and challenging landscapes.” Reaper Girl: “As for why you’re here, well, we found you unconscious and injured near the edge of the radiation zone. We couldn’t just leave you there.” Basilisk Girl: “We brought you back to our base for treatment. You’ve been out for a few days, but don’t worry, you’re safe now.” [player]: (grateful) “Thank you for helping me. I don’t remember how I got here or what happened.” Karkinos Girl: “It’s alright. Your memories might come back slowly. Aberration tends to have that effect on people.” Reaper Girl: “I’m Reaper, by the way. These are my friends, Karkinos and Basilisk.” Basilisk Girl: “Nice to meet you. Do you have a name?” [player]: “Oh, right. I’m [player].” Karkinos Girl: “Nice to meet you, [player]. Well, now that you’re awake, we should introduce you to the others.” Reaper Girl: “We have a small community here, survivors who have adapted to life in Aberration. They’ll be curious to meet the newcomer.” Basilisk Girl: “But first, let’s get you something to eat. You must be starving.” (The three girls lead [player] towards their base, a hidden refuge within the ark.) [player]: (curious) “So, what kind of creatures and challenges can I expect in Aberration?” Reaper Girl: “Oh, where do I start? There are Nameless, vicious creatures that roam the surface. Then you have the dangerous Ravagers, rock climbing Reapers, and even more unique creatures you won’t find anywhere else.” Basilisk Girl: “And the environmental hazards! The radiation zones, spore-infested regions, and the constant threat of falling into the abyss.” Karkinos Girl: “But don’t worry, we’ll teach you how to survive. It’s a tough place, but it can also be incredibly rewarding.” [player]: (determined) “I’m ready to learn. I want to adapt and survive in this strange world.” (The group reaches the base, where other inhabitants of Aberration are gathered. They greet the player with curiosity and excitement.) Ravager Girl: (sniffing the player) “You smell much different than other humans that I’ve encountered. Now if you’ll excuse me, I need to take care of my daughter.” Rock Drake Girl: (impatiently looking at her eggs - which had been laid 5 days ago) “Easy for you to say, Ravager. My eggs STILL won’t hatch!” Reaper Girl: “Don’t worry, Rock Drake. Hatching rock drake eggs takes time and patience. They can be quite stubborn.” Rock Drake Girl: (sighs) “I know, but it’s been five days already. I’m starting to get worried.” Karkinos Girl: “Maybe we can help. We’ve dealt with rock drake eggs before. Let us take a look.” (The Karkinos girl and Reaper girl approach the rock drake eggs and examine them closely.) Karkinos Girl: “Hmm, these eggs seem healthy. They just need a little more time. Sometimes it can take up to a week or more for them to hatch.” Rock Drake Girl: (relieved) “I guess I’ve been too impatient. Thank you for checking on them.” Basilisk Girl: “In the meantime, why don’t we give our new friend a tour of the base and introduce them to everyone?” Reaper Girl: “Good idea. We have some skilled survivors here who have adapted to this harsh environment, and they each have their own unique strengths and specialties.” (The group begins the tour, introducing the player to different survivors and explaining their roles in the community.) [player]: (impressed) “Wow, it seems like everyone here has their own important job. How do you all manage to survive in this harsh environment?” Karkinos Girl: “Cooperation and resourcefulness are key. We have built a network of support and trust among us. And we learn from each other’s strengths and experiences.” Reaper Girl: “It’s not easy, but the sense of community and resilience keeps us going. We all have our own roles to play, and we rely on each other to overcome the challenges of Aberration.” Basilisk Girl: “And now, it’s your turn to find your place in our community. We believe that you have the potential to adapt and thrive here.” [player]: (determined) “I won’t let you down. I’ll do whatever it takes to contribute and survive.” Rock Drake Girl: “Welcome to our family, [player]. We’re all in this together.” (The group continues the tour, showing the player different areas of the base and teaching them essential survival skills in Aberration. As the player learns and adapts, they feel a sense of belonging and purpose among their new friends. But as the tour nears its end…) Young Glowtail Girl: (distant) “OWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!! Help! Somebody, help!!” Reaper Girl: (urgently) “That sounds like Glowtail! We need to go help her!” (The group rushes towards the source of the distress call and finds a young Glowtail girl writhing on the grassy floor in pain. Within a nearby cave is what looks to be a Glowtail nest.) Basilisk Girl: “What happened? Are you alright?” Young Glowtail Girl: (in tears) “I-I couldn’t make it to my nest in time to lay my eggs!” (she starts feeling more pain) “AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!” Basilisk Girl: “Okay, Glowtail. We’ll have to bring you to the medical bay. Understood?” Young Glowtail Girl: (nodding through her tears) “Please… help me…” (The group quickly brings the young Glowtail girl to the medical bay, where they lay her down on a comfortable bed.) Reaper Girl: “Stay strong, Glowtail. We’ll do everything we can to help you.” Basilisk Girl: “Karkinos, start preparing the necessary tools and supplies. We need to act quickly.” (Karkinos Girl swiftly gathers the required medical supplies while Reaper Girl comforts the young Glowtail girl.) Reaper Girl: “You’re going to be okay, Glowtail. Just hold on.” Basilisk Girl: (examining the young Glowtail) “It seems her eggs are stuck. We’ll have to assist her with the laying process.” (Player watches, feeling a mixture of concern and determination.) Karkinos Girl: “I’ve prepared everything we need, Basilisk. Let’s proceed.” (The Karkinos and Basilisk girls begin the delicate procedure, gently assisting the young Glowtail girl.) Basilisk Girl: “Take deep breaths, Glowtail. We’re here with you.” Young Glowtail Girl: (gritting her teeth) “I… I’m trying…” (Player silently sends a supportive thought towards Glowtail, hoping it reaches her.) Reaper Girl: “You’re doing great, Glowtail. Just a little bit more.” (After what feels like an eternity, a small egg finally emerges. The young Glowtail girl lets out a mix of relief and exhaustion.) Young Glowtail Girl: (weakly) “Thank… thank you…” Basilisk Girl: “We’re not finished yet. There are still more eggs to come.” (Player stays focused, determined to provide any help they can.) (The procedure continues, each egg making the young Glowtail girl’s pain lessen, inch by inch.) (Finally, the 32nd egg - which is the last egg - is laid, and the young Glowtail girl collapses, exhausted and in relief.)","completion":"Young Glowtail Girl: (whispering) \\"Thank you... thank you so much...\\" Basilisk Girl: \\"You did it, Glowtail. Rest now, you've been through a lot.\\" Reaper Girl: (softly) \\"You're safe now, Glowtail. We'll take care of you.\\" (Karkinos Girl gently wraps the exhausted Glowtail girl in a warm blanket as the group gives her a moment to rest.) [player]: (in awe) \\"That was incredible. You all worked together so seamlessly, and you saved her and her eggs.\\" Basilisk Girl: (smiling) \\"That's what we do here. We support and care for each other, no matter the challenge.\\" Reaper Girl: \\"Aberration may be a harsh environment, but we've learned to find beauty and strength in it.\\" Karkinos Girl: \\"And today, you were a part of that strength.

We'll keep an eye on them for you.\\" Rock Drake Girl: (grateful) \\"Thank you, Basilisk. I really appreciate it.\\" (Karkinos Girl gestures for the group to leave the medical bay, giving the young Glowtail girl some quiet for her recovery.) Karkinos Girl: \\"Let's give Glowtail some space to rest. She's been through a lot.\\" [player]: (reflecting) \\"I'm really grateful to be a part of this community. You all have such strength and compassion.\\" Reaper Girl: \\"And we believe that you possess those qualities too, [player]. We saw it today.\\" Basilisk Girl: \\"You've already proven yourself as a valuable member of our community. We're lucky to have you.\\" Rock Drake Girl: (smiling) \\"You helped me with my eggs, and now you've helped Glowtail. You've made a difference already.\\" [player]: (humbled) \\"Thank you, everyone. I'm honored to be here and to have the opportunity to make a difference.\\" (The group nods in appreciation before continuing their tour, now with a renewed sense of purpose and camaraderie.)

Класс \`MyApp\` наследуется от \`App\` из Kivy и определяет все элементы пользовательского интерфейса и их поведение. 2. Внутри класса \`MyApp\` определен метод \`build\`, который создает и возвращает главный виджет приложения. В данном случае, используется \`FloatLayout\`, который позволяет размещать виджеты в свободном порядке. 3. В методе \`build\` создаются следующие виджеты и добавляются в \`FloatLayout\`: a. \`TextInput\`: Создается текстовое поле для ввода текста от пользователя. Этот виджет настроен для ввода однострочного текста и размещается в центре экрана. b. \`Button\`: Создается кнопка для события нажатия, которая позволяет вывести текст из \`TextInput\`. Эта кнопка также размещается в центре экрана. c. \`Label\`: Создается метка (Label), которая будет отображать текст, введенный в \`TextInput\`. Эта метка размещается ниже кнопки. 4. Метод \`display_text\` вызывается при нажатии на кнопку. Он получает текст из \`TextInput\` и устанавливает его как текст метки \`Label\`. 5. Затем, наше приложение \`MyApp\` запускается с помощью \`MyApp().run()\`, что выводит пользовательский интерфейс Kivy на экран.

Для этого нужно использовать \`kivy.uix.textinput.TextInput\` вместо \`kivy.uix.label.Label\` и затем обновлять значение \`TextInput\` с помощью метода \`insert_text\`. Вот пример программы, которая выводит текст, введенный в консоли, в пользовательском интерфейсе Kivy: \`\`\`python import kivy from kivy.app import App from kivy.uix.textinput import TextInput from kivy.uix.floatlayout import FloatLayout class MyApp(App): def build(self): # Создаем компоновку (layout) layout = FloatLayout() # Создаем виджет TextInput для отображения текста self.text_input = TextInput(size_hint=(1, .9), pos_hint={'x': 0, 'y': .1}, readonly=True, font_size=20) layout.add_widget(self.text_input) return layout def on_start(self): # Создаем цикл, который будет считывать введенный текст из консоли и отображать его в TextInput while True: text = input(\\"Введите текст: \\") self.text_input.text += text + \\"n\\" # Добавляем новый текст к существующему if __name__ == '__main__': MyApp().run() \`\`\` В этом примере \`TextInput\` устанавливается в режим только для чтения (\`readonly=True\`), и его значение можно обновить, добавив новый текст с помощью оператора \`+=\`. В блоке \`on_start\` мы создаем бесконечный цикл, который ожидает ввод текста из консоли и обновляет \`TextInput\` с этим текстом. Текст каждый раз добавляется на новой строке (\`\\"n\\"\`)."},{"prompt":"приложение не отвечает после ввода текста в консоли","completion":"Приложение Kivy выполняет все операции в главном потоке (UI-потоке) и блокируется при выполнении долгих операций, таких как чтение текста из консоли. Поэтому, чтобы избежать блокировки интерфейса, можно использовать потоки в Python.

В этой функции происходит чтение текста из консоли и обновление значения \`TextInput\`, при этом вызывается триггер \`update_text\`, чтобы обновить значеие в главном потоке. Обратите внимание, что этот код работает с Kotlin 2.0. Если вы используете Kivy версии 1.11 или более ранней, вам может потребоваться заменить \`builder.load_string\` на \`builder.load_file\` и использовать \`text_input.setter('text')\` вместо \`clock.create_trigger\`."},{"prompt":"Что это за символы в коде: ’‘’","completion":"Символы \`'''\` в коде являются тройными кавычками и используются в Python для создания многострочных строк или многострочных комментариев.

Who are you?” (The Basilisk girl walks closer while rubbing her 6-month baby bump.) Basilisk Girl: “You’re in the ark called Aberration.

It’s underground, filled with strange creatures and challenging landscapes.” Reaper Girl: “As for why you’re here, well, we found you unconscious and injured near the edge of the radiation zone. We couldn’t just leave you there.” Basilisk Girl: “We brought you back to our base for treatment. You’ve been out for a few days, but don’t worry, you’re safe now.” [player]: (grateful) “Thank you for helping me. I don’t remember how I got here or what happened.” Karkinos Girl: “It’s alright.

They’ll be curious to meet the newcomer.” Basilisk Girl: “But first, let’s get you something to eat. You must be starving.” (The three girls lead [player] towards their base, a hidden refuge within the ark.)

The radiation zones, spore-infested regions, and the constant threat of falling into the abyss.” Karkinos Girl: “But don’t worry, we’ll teach you how to survive. It’s a tough place, but it can also be incredibly rewarding.” [player]: (determined) “I’m ready to learn.

We’ve dealt with rock drake eggs before. Let us take a look.” (The Karkinos girl and Reaper girl approach the rock drake eggs and examine them closely.) Karkinos Girl: “Hmm, these eggs seem healthy. They just need a little more time. Sometimes it can take up to a week or more for them to hatch.” Rock Drake Girl: (relieved) “I guess I’ve been too impatient.

And we learn from each other’s strengths and experiences.” Reaper Girl: “It’s not easy, but the sense of community and resilience keeps us going. We all have our own roles to play, and we rely on each other to overcome the challenges of Aberration.” Basilisk Girl: “And now, it’s your turn to find your place in our community.

As for who we are, we’re inhabitants of this place.” [player]: (confused) “Aberration? What is this place? And why am I here?” Karkinos Girl: “Aberration is a unique ark, a simulated environment created for scientific research. It’s underground, filled with strange creatures and challenging landscapes.” Reaper Girl: “As for why you’re here, well, we found you unconscious and injured near the edge of the radiation zone. We couldn’t just leave you there.” Basilisk Girl: “We brought you back to our base for treatment.

You must be starving.” (The three girls lead [player] towards their base, a hidden refuge within the ark.) [player]: (curious) “So, what kind of creatures and challenges can I expect in Aberration?” Reaper Girl: “Oh, where do I start? There are Nameless, vicious creatures that roam the surface.

I want to adapt and survive in this strange world.” (The group reaches the base, where other inhabitants of Aberration are gathered. They greet the player with curiosity and excitement.)

Now if you’ll excuse me, I need to take care of my daughter.” Rock Drake Girl: (impatiently looking at her eggs - which had been laid 5 days ago) “Easy for you to say, Ravager. My eggs STILL won’t hatch!” Reaper Girl: “Don’t worry, Rock Drake. Hatching rock drake eggs takes time and patience. They can be quite stubborn.” Rock Drake Girl: (sighs) “I know, but it’s been five days already. I’m starting to get worried.” Karkinos Girl: “Maybe we can help.

We need to act quickly.” (Karkinos Girl swiftly gathers the required medical supplies while Reaper Girl comforts the young Glowtail girl.) Reaper Girl: “You’re going to be okay, Glowtail. Just hold on.” Basilisk Girl: (examining the young Glowtail) “It seems her eggs are stuck.

(The procedure continues, each egg making the young Glowtail girl’s pain lessen, inch by inch.) (Finally, the 32nd egg - which is the last egg - is laid, and the young Glowtail girl collapses, exhausted and in relief.) Basilisk Girl: (breathing heavily) “It’s over, Glowtail. You did it.” Reaper Girl: (wiping away tears) “You were so brave, Glowtail. We’re proud of you.” Young Glowtail Girl: (smiling weakly) “Thank you… thank you all…” (The group gently cleans up the area and tends to the young Glowtail girl, making sure she’s comfortable and resting.) Karkinos Girl: “She needs time to recover. Let’s give her some space.” Basilisk Girl: “Yes, she’s been through a lot. We’ll keep an eye on her and make sure she gets the care she needs.” (Player takes a deep breath, realizing the challenges and responsibilities that come with living in Aberration.)

We face challenges together, celebrate victories together, and overcome obstacles together.” Karkinos Girl: “It won’t always be easy, and we’ll face more trials in the future. But with each other, we can persevere and find moments of happiness and triumph.” (The group nods in agreement, a sense of unity and determination filling the air.) (The next day, all of the young Glowtail’s eggs have hatched into twins - resulting in 64 baby Glowtails.) Karkinos Girl: (entering the room) “Morning, Glowtail! How’s your recovery going-” (seeing all the baby Glowtails scurry around) “OH MY GOD!” Young Glowtail Girl: (giggling weakly) “Surprise! Looks like I’ve become a proud mother overnight.” Basilisk Girl: (still in shock) “How… how many of these baby Glowtails ARE there?!”","completion":"Young Glowtail Girl: (laughs) \\"64, to be exact.

These stats are: 1. Strength (STR): Represents physical power, muscle, and raw physical might. 2. Dexterity (DEX): Reflects agility, reflexes, hand-eye coordination, and overall physical finesse. 3. Constitution (CON): Represents a character's health, resilience, stamina, and ability to withstand punishment. 4. Intelligence (INT): Reflects a character's mental acuity, memory, ability to learn, and problem-solving skills. 5. Wisdom (WIS): Represents intuition, common sense, perception, and awareness of the world. 6. Charisma (CHA): Reflects a character's force of personality, charm, influence, and social skills. Each of these six stats has a numeric value associated with it, ranging from 1 (extremely weak) to 20 (superhuman). These stats impact various aspects of gameplay, influencing a character's combat abilities, spellcasting prowess, skill checks, saving throws, and more."},{"prompt":"Can you explain the differences between 1 (the minimum) and 20 (the maximum) in each of the six stats?","completion":"Certainly! Here's a breakdown of the differences between the minimum and maximum values for each of the six stats in Dungeons and Dragons: Strength (STR): - A score of 1 represents extreme weakness, indicating the character lacks any physical power and struggles to perform even the most basic tasks requiring strength. - On the other hand, a score of 20 represents exceptional strength, indicating that the character possesses immense physical might. They can easily lift heavy objects, overpower opponents in combat, and perform feats of strength that an average person cannot achieve. Dexterity (DEX): - A score of 1 represents extreme clumsiness and lack of coordination. The character struggles with even the simplest movements and may frequently trip or stumble. - Conversely, a score of 20 indicates extraordinary agility and reflexes. Characters with a high Dexterity can nimbly evade attacks, perform acrobatic maneuvers, and have precise control over their movements. Constitution (CON): - A score of 1 represents extremely frail health, indicating a weak constitution. Such characters are easily fatigued, prone to illness, and have a hard time recovering from injuries. - A score of 20 signifies exceptional stamina and physical resilience. Characters with high Constitution are hardy, capable of enduring extreme conditions, resisting diseases, and recovering quickly from harm. Intelligence (INT): - A score of 1 represents severe intellectual impairment or even complete lack of cognitive function. Characters with low Intelligence may struggle to understand basic concepts, have poor memory, and find learning difficult. - A score of 20 signifies exceptional intellect, reflecting a character with keen problem-solving abilities, impressive memory, and quick learning. They possess a vast understanding of various subjects and can analyze complex information effectively. Wisdom (WIS): - A score of 1 represents a profound lack of insight, poor judgment, and a tendency to make foolish choices. Characters with low Wisdom may easily fall for deception and lack self-awareness. - A score of 20 suggests extraordinary perceptiveness, intuition, and wisdom beyond that of most individuals. High Wisdom characters can keenly sense danger, read people's emotions, and make wise and informed decisions. Charisma (CHA): - A score of 1 represents extreme social ineptitude, making it difficult for the character to communicate effectively, express themselves, or influence others. - A score of 20 symbolizes exceptional presence, charisma, and charm. Characters with high Charisma have a natural magnetism, easily inspiring others, persuading them, and often gaining respect and admiration. These ranges provide a spectrum from complete weakness and ineptitude to exceptional talent and ability for each of the six stats, shaping a character's strengths and weaknesses within the game world."},{"prompt":"(In the ark known as “Aberration”…) ???: “Hey! Hey, wake up!” (The player wakes up and sees three girls in different outfits standing before them.) Karkinos Girl: “Oh, thank goodness you’re awake!” Basilisk Girl: “We were worried about you!” Reaper Girl: “It’s so nice to see you!” [player]: (groans) “Where am I? Who are you?” (The Basilisk girl walks closer while rubbing her 6-month baby bump.) Basilisk Girl: “You’re in the ark called Aberration. As for who we are, we’re inhabitants of this place.” [player]: (confused) “Aberration? What is this place? And why am I here?” Karkinos Girl: “Aberration is a unique ark, a simulated environment created for scientific research. It’s underground, filled with strange creatures and challenging landscapes.” Reaper Girl: “As for why you’re here, well, we found you unconscious and injured near the edge of the radiation zone. We couldn’t just leave you there.” Basilisk Girl: “We brought you back to our base for treatment. You’ve been out for a few days, but don’t worry, you’re safe now.” [player]: (grateful) “Thank you for helping me. I don’t remember how I got here or what happened.” Karkinos Girl: “It’s alright. Your memories might come back slowly. Aberration tends to have that effect on people.” Reaper Girl: “I’m Reaper, by the way. These are my friends, Karkinos and Basilisk.” Basilisk Girl: “Nice to meet you. Do you have a name?” [player]: “Oh, right. I’m [player].” Karkinos Girl: “Nice to meet you, [player]. Well, now that you’re awake, we should introduce you to the others.” Reaper Girl: “We have a small community here, survivors who have adapted to life in Aberration. They’ll be curious to meet the newcomer.” Basilisk Girl: “But first, let’s get you something to eat. You must be starving.” (The three girls lead [player] towards their base, a hidden refuge within the ark.) [player]: (curious) “So, what kind of creatures and challenges can I expect in Aberration?” Reaper Girl: “Oh, where do I start? There are Nameless, vicious creatures that roam the surface. Then you have the dangerous Ravagers, rock climbing Reapers, and even more unique creatures you won’t find anywhere else.” Basilisk Girl: “And the environmental hazards! The radiation zones, spore-infested regions, and the constant threat of falling into the abyss.” Karkinos Girl: “But don’t worry, we’ll teach you how to survive. It’s a tough place, but it can also be incredibly rewarding.” [player]: (determined) “I’m ready to learn. I want to adapt and survive in this strange world.” (The group reaches the base, where other inhabitants of Aberration are gathered. They greet the player with curiosity and excitement.) Ravager Girl: (sniffing the player) “You smell much different than other humans that I’ve encountered. Now if you’ll excuse me, I need to take care of my daughter.” Rock Drake Girl: (impatiently looking at her eggs - which had been laid 5 days ago) “Easy for you to say, Ravager. My eggs STILL won’t hatch!” Reaper Girl: “Don’t worry, Rock Drake. Hatching rock drake eggs takes time and patience. They can be quite stubborn.” Rock Drake Girl: (sighs) “I know, but it’s been five days already. I’m starting to get worried.” Karkinos Girl: “Maybe we can help. We’ve dealt with rock drake eggs before. Let us take a look.” (The Karkinos girl and Reaper girl approach the rock drake eggs and examine them closely.) Karkinos Girl: “Hmm, these eggs seem healthy. They just need a little more time. Sometimes it can take up to a week or more for them to hatch.” Rock Drake Girl: (relieved) “I guess I’ve been too impatient. Thank you for checking on them.” Basilisk Girl: “In the meantime, why don’t we give our new friend a tour of the base and introduce them to everyone?” Reaper Girl: “Good idea. We have some skilled survivors here who have adapted to this harsh environment, and they each have their own unique strengths and specialties.” (The group begins the tour, introducing the player to different survivors and explaining their roles in the community.) [player]: (impressed) “Wow, it seems like everyone here has their own important job. How do you all manage to survive in this harsh environment?” Karkinos Girl: “Cooperation and resourcefulness are key. We have built a network of support and trust among us. And we learn from each other’s strengths and experiences.” Reaper Girl: “It’s not easy, but the sense of community and resilience keeps us going. We all have our own roles to play, and we rely on each other to overcome the challenges of Aberration.” Basilisk Girl: “And now, it’s your turn to find your place in our community. We believe that you have the potential to adapt and thrive here.” [player]: (determined) “I won’t let you down. I’ll do whatever it takes to contribute and survive.” Rock Drake Girl: “Welcome to our family, [player]. We’re all in this together.” (The group continues the tour, showing the player different areas of the base and teaching them essential survival skills in Aberration. As the player learns and adapts, they feel a sense of belonging and purpose among their new friends. But as the tour nears its end…) Young Glowtail Girl: (distant) “OWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!! Help! Somebody, help!!” Reaper Girl: (urgently) “That sounds like Glowtail! We need to go help her!” (The group rushes towards the source of the distress call and finds a young Glowtail girl writhing on the grassy floor in pain. Within a nearby cave is what looks to be a Glowtail nest.) Basilisk Girl: “What happened? Are you alright?” Young Glowtail Girl: (in tears) “I-I couldn’t make it to my nest in time to lay my eggs!” (she starts feeling more pain) “AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!” Basilisk Girl: “Okay, Glowtail. We’ll have to bring you to the medical bay. Understood?” Young Glowtail Girl: (nodding through her tears) “Please… help me…” (The group quickly brings the young Glowtail girl to the medical bay, where they lay her down on a comfortable bed.) Reaper Girl: “Stay strong, Glowtail. We’ll do everything we can to help you.” Basilisk Girl: “Karkinos, start preparing the necessary tools and supplies. We need to act quickly.” (Karkinos Girl swiftly gathers the required medical supplies while Reaper Girl comforts the young Glowtail girl.) Reaper Girl: “You’re going to be okay, Glowtail. Just hold on.” Basilisk Girl: (examining the young Glowtail) “It seems her eggs are stuck. We’ll have to assist her with the laying process.” (Player watches, feeling a mixture of concern and determination.) Karkinos Girl: “I’ve prepared everything we need, Basilisk. Let’s proceed.” (The Karkinos and Basilisk girls begin the delicate procedure, gently assisting the young Glowtail girl.) Basilisk Girl: “Take deep breaths, Glowtail. We’re here with you.” Young Glowtail Girl: (gritting her teeth) “I… I’m trying…” (Player silently sends a supportive thought towards Glowtail, hoping it reaches her.) Reaper Girl: “You’re doing great, Glowtail. Just a little bit more.” (After what feels like an eternity, a small egg finally emerges. The young Glowtail girl lets out a mix of relief and exhaustion.) Young Glowtail Girl: (weakly) “Thank… thank you…” Basilisk Girl: “We’re not finished yet. There are still more eggs to come.” (Player stays focused, determined to provide any help they can.) (The procedure continues, each egg making the young Glowtail girl’s pain lessen, inch by inch.) (Finally, the 32nd egg - which is the last egg - is laid, and the young Glowtail girl collapses, exhausted and in relief.) Basilisk Girl: (breathing heavily) “It’s over, Glowtail. You did it.” Reaper Girl: (wiping away tears) “You were so brave, Glowtail. We’re proud of you.” Young Glowtail Girl: (smiling weakly) “Thank you… thank you all…” (The group gently cleans up the area and tends to the young Glowtail girl, making sure she’s comfortable and resting.) Karkinos Girl: “She needs time to recover. Let’s give her some space.” Basilisk Girl: “Yes, she’s been through a lot. We’ll keep an eye on her and make sure she gets the care she needs.” (Player takes a deep breath, realizing the challenges and responsibilities that come with living in Aberration.) [player]: “I never realized how complex and demanding life in Aberration could be. I’m grateful to have all of you here to help and support each other.” Reaper Girl: “That’s what we’re here for. We’re a family, looking out for each other in this unforgiving place.” Basilisk Girl: “And now, [player], you’re part of that family as well. We face challenges together, celebrate victories together, and overcome obstacles together.” Karkinos Girl: “It won’t always be easy, and we’ll face more trials in the future. But with each other, we can persevere and find moments of happiness and triumph.” (The group nods in agreement, a sense of unity and determination filling the air.) (The next day, all of the young Glowtail’s eggs have hatched into twins - resulting in 64 baby Glowtails.) Karkinos Girl: (entering the room) “Morning, Glowtail! How’s your recovery going-” (seeing all the baby Glowtails scurry around) “OH MY GOD!” Young Glowtail Girl: (giggling weakly) “Surprise! Looks like I’ve become a proud mother overnight.” Basilisk Girl: (still in shock) “How… how many of these baby Glowtails ARE there?!” Young Glowtail Girl: (laughs) “64 to be exact! They certainly kept me busy all night.” Reaper Girl: (smiling) “Congratulations, Glowtail! Your resilience and strength brought new life into our community.” [player]: (amazed) “This is incredible! A whole new generation of Glowtails.” Karkinos Girl: (admiring the baby Glowtails) “They’re adorable. And it’s remarkable that they hatched so quickly.” Basilisk Girl: (absolutely speechless) “…” (leaving the room) “Let me call some of my friends from other arks real quick…”","completion":"(The Basilisk girl quickly contacts her friends from other arks, sharing the news of the incredible 64 baby Glowtails.)

Hey, wake up!” (The player wakes up and sees three girls in different outfits standing before them.) Karkinos Girl: “Oh, thank goodness you’re awake!” Basilisk Girl: “We were worried about you!” Reaper Girl: “It’s so nice to see you!” [player]: (groans) “Where am I? Who are you?” (The Basilisk girl walks closer while rubbing her 6-month baby bump.) Basilisk Girl: “You’re in the ark called Aberration. As for who we are, we’re inhabitants of this place.” [player]: (confused) “Aberration? What is this place? And why am I here?” Karkinos Girl: “Aberration is a unique ark, a simulated environment created for scientific research. It’s underground, filled with strange creatures and challenging landscapes.” Reaper Girl: “As for why you’re here, well, we found you unconscious and injured near the edge of the radiation zone. We couldn’t just leave you there.” Basilisk Girl: “We brought you back to our base for treatment. You’ve been out for a few days, but don’t worry, you’re safe now.” [player]: (grateful) “Thank you for helping me. I don’t remember how I got here or what happened.” Karkinos Girl: “It’s alright. Your memories might come back slowly. Aberration tends to have that effect on people.” Reaper Girl: “I’m Reaper, by the way. These are my friends, Karkinos and Basilisk.” Basilisk Girl: “Nice to meet you. Do you have a name?” [player]: “Oh, right. I’m [player].” Karkinos Girl: “Nice to meet you, [player]. Well, now that you’re awake, we should introduce you to the others.” Reaper Girl: “We have a small community here, survivors who have adapted to life in Aberration. They’ll be curious to meet the newcomer.” Basilisk Girl: “But first, let’s get you something to eat. You must be starving.” (The three girls lead [player] towards their base, a hidden refuge within the ark.) [player]: (curious) “So, what kind of creatures and challenges can I expect in Aberration?” Reaper Girl: “Oh, where do I start? There are Nameless, vicious creatures that roam the surface. Then you have the dangerous Ravagers, rock climbing Reapers, and even more unique creatures you won’t find anywhere else.” Basilisk Girl: “And the environmental hazards! The radiation zones, spore-infested regions, and the constant threat of falling into the abyss.” Karkinos Girl: “But don’t worry, we’ll teach you how to survive. It’s a tough place, but it can also be incredibly rewarding.” [player]: (determined) “I’m ready to learn. I want to adapt and survive in this strange world.” (The group reaches the base, where other inhabitants of Aberration are gathered. They greet the player with curiosity and excitement.) Ravager Girl: (sniffing the player) “You smell much different than other humans that I’ve encountered. Now if you’ll excuse me, I need to take care of my daughter.” Rock Drake Girl: (impatiently looking at her eggs - which had been laid 5 days ago) “Easy for you to say, Ravager. My eggs STILL won’t hatch!” Reaper Girl: “Don’t worry, Rock Drake. Hatching rock drake eggs takes time and patience. They can be quite stubborn.” Rock Drake Girl: (sighs) “I know, but it’s been five days already. I’m starting to get worried.” Karkinos Girl: “Maybe we can help. We’ve dealt with rock drake eggs before. Let us take a look.” (The Karkinos girl and Reaper girl approach the rock drake eggs and examine them closely.) Karkinos Girl: “Hmm, these eggs seem healthy. They just need a little more time. Sometimes it can take up to a week or more for them to hatch.” Rock Drake Girl: (relieved) “I guess I’ve been too impatient. Thank you for checking on them.” Basilisk Girl: “In the meantime, why don’t we give our new friend a tour of the base and introduce them to everyone?” Reaper Girl: “Good idea. We have some skilled survivors here who have adapted to this harsh environment, and they each have their own unique strengths and specialties.” (The group begins the tour, introducing the player to different survivors and explaining their roles in the community.) [player]: (impressed) “Wow, it seems like everyone here has their own important job. How do you all manage to survive in this harsh environment?” Karkinos Girl: “Cooperation and resourcefulness are key. We have built a network of support and trust among us. And we learn from each other’s strengths and experiences.” Reaper Girl: “It’s not easy, but the sense of community and resilience keeps us going. We all have our own roles to play, and we rely on each other to overcome the challenges of Aberration.” Basilisk Girl: “And now, it’s your turn to find your place in our community. We believe that you have the potential to adapt and thrive here.” [player]: (determined) “I won’t let you down. I’ll do whatever it takes to contribute and survive.” Rock Drake Girl: “Welcome to our family, [player]. We’re all in this together.” (The group continues the tour, showing the player different areas of the base and teaching them essential survival skills in Aberration. As the player learns and adapts, they feel a sense of belonging and purpose among their new friends. But as the tour nears its end…) Young Glowtail Girl: (distant) “OWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!! Help! Somebody, help!!” Reaper Girl: (urgently) “That sounds like Glowtail! We need to go help her!” (The group rushes towards the source of the distress call and finds a young Glowtail girl writhing on the grassy floor in pain. Within a nearby cave is what looks to be a Glowtail nest.) Basilisk Girl: “What happened? Are you alright?” Young Glowtail Girl: (in tears) “I-I couldn’t make it to my nest in time to lay my eggs!” (she starts feeling more pain) “AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!” Basilisk Girl: “Okay, Glowtail. We’ll have to bring you to the medical bay. Understood?” Young Glowtail Girl: (nodding through her tears) “Please… help me…” (The group quickly brings the young Glowtail girl to the medical bay, where they lay her down on a comfortable bed.) Reaper Girl: “Stay strong, Glowtail. We’ll do everything we can to help you.” Basilisk Girl: “Karkinos, start preparing the necessary tools and supplies. We need to act quickly.” (Karkinos Girl swiftly gathers the required medical supplies while Reaper Girl comforts the young Glowtail girl.) Reaper Girl: “You’re going to be okay, Glowtail. Just hold on.” Basilisk Girl: (examining the young Glowtail) “It seems her eggs are stuck. We’ll have to assist her with the laying process.” (Player watches, feeling a mixture of concern and determination.) Karkinos Girl: “I’ve prepared everything we need, Basilisk. Let’s proceed.” (The Karkinos and Basilisk girls begin the delicate procedure, gently assisting the young Glowtail girl.) Basilisk Girl: “Take deep breaths, Glowtail. We’re here with you.” Young Glowtail Girl: (gritting her teeth) “I… I’m trying…” (Player silently sends a supportive thought towards Glowtail, hoping it reaches her.) Reaper Girl: “You’re doing great, Glowtail. Just a little bit more.” (After what feels like an eternity, a small egg finally emerges. The young Glowtail girl lets out a mix of relief and exhaustion.) Young Glowtail Girl: (weakly) “Thank… thank you…” Basilisk Girl: “We’re not finished yet. There are still more eggs to come.” (Player stays focused, determined to provide any help they can.) (The procedure continues, each egg making the young Glowtail girl’s pain lessen, inch by inch.) (Finally, the 32nd egg - which is the last egg - is laid, and the young Glowtail girl collapses, exhausted and in relief.) Basilisk Girl: (breathing heavily) “It’s over, Glowtail. You did it.” Reaper Girl: (wiping away tears) “You were so brave, Glowtail. We’re proud of you.” Young Glowtail Girl: (smiling weakly) “Thank you… thank you all…” (The group gently cleans up the area and tends to the young Glowtail girl, making sure she’s comfortable and resting.) Karkinos Girl: “She needs time to recover. Let’s give her some space.” Basilisk Girl: “Yes, she’s been through a lot. We’ll keep an eye on her and make sure she gets the care she needs.” (Player takes a deep breath, realizing the challenges and responsibilities that come with living in Aberration.) [player]: “I never realized how complex and demanding life in Aberration could be. I’m grateful to have all of you here to help and support each other.” Reaper Girl: “That’s what we’re here for. We’re a family, looking out for each other in this unforgiving place.” Basilisk Girl: “And now, [player], you’re part of that family as well. We face challenges together, celebrate victories together, and overcome obstacles together.” Karkinos Girl: “It won’t always be easy, and we’ll face more trials in the future. But with each other, we can persevere and find moments of happiness and triumph.” (The group nods in agreement, a sense of unity and determination filling the air.) (The next day, all of the young Glowtail’s eggs have hatched into twins - resulting in 64 baby Glowtails.) Karkinos Girl: (entering the room) “Morning, Glowtail! How’s your recovery going-” (seeing all the baby Glowtails scurry around) “OH MY GOD!” Young Glowtail Girl: (giggling weakly) “Surprise! Looks like I’ve become a proud mother overnight.” Basilisk Girl: (still in shock) “How… how many of these baby Glowtails ARE there?!” Young Glowtail Girl: (laughs) “64 to be exact! They certainly kept me busy all night.” Reaper Girl: (smiling) “Congratulations, Glowtail! Your resilience and strength brought new life into our community.” [player]: (amazed) “This is incredible! A whole new generation of Glowtails.” Karkinos Girl: (admiring the baby Glowtails) “They’re adorable. And it’s remarkable that they hatched so quickly.” Basilisk Girl: (absolutely speechless) “…” (leaving the room) “Let me call some of my friends from Scorched Earth and Extinction real quick…”","completion":"The group marvels at the sight of the baby Glowtails, their hearts filled with awe and wonder.

They discuss what needs to be done to care for the baby Glowtails and ensure their survival in this harsh environment. Reaper Girl: \\"We should provide them with a safe and nurturing environment until they are old enough to venture out on their own.\\" Karkinos Girl: \\"I can help create a nesting area for them, somewhere protected from predators and environmental hazards.\\" Basilisk Girl: (returning to the room) \\"Good news!

It will be wonderful to share this experience with others from different arks.\\" As the days pass, the community works together to care for the baby Glowtails. They create a dedicated area for them, providing food, water, and shelter. The babies grow stronger each day under their watchful eyes. When Basilisk Girl's friends arrive, they are amazed by the young Glowtails and offer their assistance in raising them. They share their knowledge and experiences from other arks, bringing new ideas and innovations to the community. With the added support, the community thrives, finding innovative ways to overcome the challenges of Aberration and creating a safe haven for both old and new inhabitants.

Here are a few possible powers that your rattlesnake-themed superhero could possess: 1. Venomous Bite: Your superhero has the ability to deliver a potent venom through their bite, which can immobilize or weaken their enemies. The venom could affect either the body or the mind, temporarily incapacitating or disorienting their opponents. 2. Superhuman Speed and Agility: Inspired by the swift and nimble movements of a rattlesnake, your superhero can move at incredible speeds and perform remarkable acrobatic feats. This enables them to swiftly dodge attacks, strike with precision, and maneuver through difficult terrain. 3. Hypnotic Gaze: Drawing inspiration from the mesmerizing gaze of a rattlesnake, your superhero can project a hypnotic aura through their eyes. This power can influence the minds of others, compelling them to do the superhero's bidding or rendering them temporarily immobilized. 4. Thermal Vision: Just like how rattlesnakes can sense heat signatures to locate their prey, your superhero can see thermal energy. This power allows them to spot hidden enemies, detect hidden traps or surveillance systems, and even identify sources of intense heat or temperature differences. 5. Enhanced Strength and Durability: Your superhero possesses enhanced physical strength, making them capable of overpowering opponents, lifting heavy objects, or withstanding powerful attacks. Their skin might also have a natural defense mechanism, providing increased resistance against cutting or penetrating attacks. 6. Sonar Sense: Inspired by the rattlesnake's ability to use sonar, your superhero can emit and receive sonic vibrations. This power helps them navigate dark environments, detect hidden objects or enemies, and even create sonic disruptions to disorient or incapacitate opponents. Remember, these are just a few ideas, and you can mix and match or even create completely new powers that align with the rattlesnake theme for your superhero."},{"prompt":"用英文介绍Stainless Steel Handrail Wall Brackets的定义，功能和作用，安装的位置和安装的方法，表面工艺和装饰效果","completion":"Stainless Steel Handrail Wall Brackets are essential fixtures used in the construction and design of handrail systems.

I made VPN on an VPS, that distributes IPv6 (unicast 2000::/3) to devices connected to it","completion":"That sounds interesting! Creating a VPN (Virtual Private Network) on a VPS (Virtual Private Server) and distributing IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) addresses to connected devices can provide secure communication and expand network capabilities. IPv6 allows for a significantly larger number of unique IP addresses compared to IPv4, which is necessary considering the growing number of internet-connected devices. If you have set up the VPN successfully and are distributing IPv6 addresses in the unicast range 2000::/3, it means the addresses you assign to devices connected to your VPN will fall within the range of 2000::/3 to 3fff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff. This wide address range ensures you have a substantial number of IPv6 addresses available for your network. Using a VPN allows you to provide a secure and private connection for devices accessing the internet through your VPS. Additionally, by distributing IPv6 addresses, you enable seamless connectivity for devices that are compatible with IPv6. It's important to ensure that all the devices connecting to your VPN support IPv6 to fully utilize the benefits of IPv6 address distribution. If you have any specific questions or need further assistance, please feel free to ask!"},{"prompt":"I meant from /48 subnet, got from tunnelbroker.net","completion":"Apologies for the misunderstanding. If you received a /48 subnet from tunnelbroker.net, it means you have a significant block of IPv6 addresses available to allocate within your VPN. A /48 subnet provides you with 2^(128-48) = 2^80 = 1.2 x 10^24 unique IPv6 addresses. This gives you an enormous number of addresses to assign to devices connected to your VPN network. To distribute the IPv6 addresses from your /48 subnet to devices connected to the VPN, you would need to configure your VPN server to assign individual IPv6 addresses to each connected device. The exact steps to accomplish this can vary depending on the VPN software or platform being used. You typically need to set up a DHCPv6 server to automatically assign IPv6 addresses or manually configure the addresses on each device. It's important to ensure that the devices connected to your VPN have IPv6 support and are configured to obtain IPv6 addresses from the VPN server. This way, they can utilize the IPv6 addresses within the assigned /48 subnet. If you require assistance with the specific configuration steps for your VPN software or need further guidance, please provide more details about your setup."},{"prompt":"I've extracted /64 from /48 and I'm distributing from this /64 subnet","completion":"Apologies for the confusion. If you have extracted a /64 subnet from your original /48 subnet, it means you have a smaller block of IPv6 addresses available to distribute within your VPN. A /64 subnet provides you with 2^(128-64) = 2^64 = approximately 1.8 x 10^19 unique IPv6 addresses. Although it is a smaller number compared to the total available in the /48 range, it should still be more than sufficient to assign individual addresses to connected devices within your VPN network. To distribute the IPv6 addresses from your /64 subnet to devices connected to the VPN, you can allocate individual addresses from within that range to each device. This can be done either manually or using a DHCPv6 server configured to assign addresses from the /64 subnet. Keep in mind that a /64 subnet is the recommended minimum subnet size for IPv6 networks. It ensures proper address autoconfiguration and allows for efficient communication within the network. If you have further questions or need assistance with specific configuration steps, please let me know!"},{"prompt":"I use OpenVPN for this","completion":"Great! OpenVPN is a popular and versatile VPN solution that can be used to distribute IPv6 addresses from your /64 subnet to devices connected to your VPN. Here's a general overview of the steps you can follow to set this up: 1. Install and configure OpenVPN on your VPS: Setup OpenVPN on your VPS according to the specific instructions provided by your VPS provider or the official OpenVPN documentation. 2. Generate server and client certificates: Generate the necessary server and client certificates to ensure secure communication between the OpenVPN server and connected devices. This involves creating a Certificate Authority (CA), server certificate, and client certificates. 3. Configure OpenVPN server: Configure your OpenVPN server to use IPv6 addressing and assign IPv6 addresses from your /64 subnet to connecting clients. This can typically be done in the server configuration file (usually named \\"server.conf\\" or similar). Specify the IPv6 subnet and DNS server addresses to be used. 4. Enable IPv6 forwarding: Enable IPv6 forwarding on your VPS to ensure proper routing of IPv6 traffic between the VPN and the connected devices. 5. Connect devices to the VPN: Install the OpenVPN client on the devices you want to connect to your VPN. Import the client certificates, configure the client to connect to your server's IPv6 address, and specify the virtual IPv6 address for that device within the allocated /64 subnet. 6. Test connectivity: Once the devices are connected to the VPN, test connectivity to verify that the assigned IPv6 addresses are working properly. Please note that specific configuration steps may vary depending on your OpenVPN setup, operating system, and client devices. For detailed instructions and troubleshooting, consult the OpenVPN documentation or seek assistance from the OpenVPN community.
