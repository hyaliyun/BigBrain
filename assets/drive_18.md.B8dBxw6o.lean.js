How do they compare to characters from Marvel or DC? What are some of their most impressive feats?","completion":"OK, I must get this out of the way first: Compared to the characters found in Marvel and DC, the Rangers don’t pass muster. There are no reality warpers, aside from Lord Drakkon. Maybe Dark Specter and Maligore, although we never got to see the extent of their abilities. And they’re enemies anyway, so immaterial to the question at hand. So, Drakkon was the most powerful Ranger ever, and he had reality altering ability. But even still, Drakkon got defeated, and it was his own fault. The Tommy that was defeated and haunted Drakkon had been quietly finding the Rangers that Drakkon defeated, and brought them back. With the help of the Emissaries, beings who act on behalf of the enigmatic Morphin Masters. So now it’s on again. For the final time. But now there’s a plan. They know what must be done. So Drakkon was defeated, all because at the end of the day, he was still Human. For all his power, he got selfish. He wanted adulation. He wanted ultimate power. He wanted to be seen as the savior. And he was willing to kill to get it, and rule with an iron fist. He had the arrogance of Namor or Dr. Doom, but had none of the wisdom. This was the strongest Ranger ever. With the Heart of the Master, he was able to destroy the multiverse, and rebuild it as he saw fit. Sure, you can say that Owen Reece is cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs, and you’d be right. But he alone would be more than enough to destroy Drakkon. He wouldn’t be enough for the Molecule Man, who made even Galactus fear for his existence. The same Galactus who can shrug off the most powerful attacks from the likes of Odin. Galactus, who was more than enough for Thor, who’s his Herald, and has the Thorforce. And speaking of the Rune King, arguably Thor’s most powerful form (can’t speak to Necro Thor, hence the arguably qualifier,) he was able to defeat Those Who Sit Above in Shadow, whom Odin couldn’t. Those Who Sit Above in Shadow were said to be the Gods to the Gods. Ancient beings older and considerably more powerful even than Odin and the other Skyfathers. They were responsible for the never ending cycle of Ragnarok, and Thor ended it right there, at that moment. He deafened TWSAIS, and destroyed Yggdrassil, the World Tree. If Drakkon had been a bit more imaginative, maybe, and that’s a strong maybe, he’d be on this level. But he was ironically weak. Weakness was the very thing he claimed to have shed. Yet for all his power, he sought adulation. “Pride goeth before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall.” Pride fell many before him, and he was no different. There are other Marvel characters who’d give him fits, such as the Marquis of Death, the Chaos King, and Jim Jaspers, for starters. DC have their own reality warpers, and they can defeat Drakkon, too. His problem was he lacked vision. Why bother rewriting reality itself, if all you’re going to do is have everyone bend the knee? That’d get real boring, after awhile. And it eventually foments chaos and rebellion. On another note, the BOOM! Comics are awesome. Too bad Saban didn’t wait and adapt them for the new movie, instead of creating that 2017 abomination. The comics make everyone competent. Babboo and Squat are menacing, Rita plays mind games with everyone, and the green chaos energy was brilliant. The mind warped Kimberly reminded me of Psycho Pink. The only Psycho Ranger who was actually able to kill a Ranger. As psychotic as Psycho Blue and Psycho Red were, it was Psycho Pink who ultimately completed her task. Drakkon’s Kim, aka the Ranger Slayer, reminded me of Psycho Pink. Even after she was freed from Drakkon’s control. That’s how great these comics are. The greatest Ranger feats are probably the following: • Defeating Ivan Ooze- Ivan Ooze was an ancient enemy that was far beyond any Power Rangers villain up to that point. Master Vile wouldn’t be as dangerous, and he was able to steal and temporarily the Zeo Crystal. The Machine Empire would be horrible, but even they wouldn’t come close to killing Zordon. Ooze did so with very little effort, showing just how dangerous he was. The Rangers were able to defeat him, something their predecessors couldn’t do 6,000 years ago. • Resurrecting Zordon with the Ninjetti powers- This was a power not shown in Power Rangers before, or since. The Great Power, which was only shown in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers The Movie, had the potential to do many things the Rangers couldn’t before. One such thing was the ability to resurrect Zordon, who’d passed while the Rangers were on their quest to get power to defeat Ooze. • Defeating Astronema during the Countdown- In the in Space season finale, which was supposed to be the series finale, Astronema had marshaled her truly massive forces, and spread them across the universe, striking any place that were part of the forces of light. Eltar, Edenoi, Aquitar, it didn’t matter where it was. There were Piranhatrons, Z Putties, Tengas, and Quantrons alike. There were warlords, like Divatox, Lord Zedd, King Mondo, and Rita, all attacking. Things were looking very bleak for Earth, which had been slated for destruction by Astronema, after she felt they were hiding the Rangers from her. But they showed up, and eventually defeated her. The Legendary Battle from Super Megaforce pales in comparison. These are the most impressive Ranger feats that come to mind."},{"prompt":"any way?","completion":"Yes self confidence helps a person very much and can a key role in the success of the person.

The tactics know as blitzkreig using masses of armor and mechanized troops to quickly out maneuver and cut off large portions of troops had only been used one other time against the poorly prepared and equipped polish army. Germany was now fighting the 2 most prestigious and powerful militaries in open combat on the offensive. Now during the preliminary planning period for the offensive many German generals came up with a reimagining of the shleifen plan of WW1. Attack through Belgium and strike at France hard and fast and hope they crumple. Heinz Guderien had other Ideas he presented these plans to Hitler and the German high command. The plan suggested feint attack into Belgium engage the British and French army in Belgium then thrust through the Ardennes region of Luxembourg then cut up towards Calais and surround the BEF and French armies. Now this plan was risky because blitzkreig had shown some deficiences it created very long supply lines and usually left support units scrambling to keep up with the tanks as most still used horse for transportation. With the plan if the British or French realized this move to early they could cut back and counter attack. Also the Ardennes is a very heavily forested region making it very hard for tanks to pass. Slowing the attack making discovery all the more likely. This plan allowed for the Germans to go around the maginot line and surround the entirety of the British army and a large portion of the French and despite its risks it worked. The attack was launched on the 10th of May 1940 the Germans had the BEF surrounded at Dunkirk by the 26th but the British were saved by the main flaw of blitzkreig, supply lines. The German units had run out of fuel and ammunition and ceased there attack long enough to allow near 400,000 men to evacuate back to England during the Dunkirk evacuations.

Falwell posts a ridiculous picture of himself for some parody project, and the moral guardians of the United States lose their collective minds. Now top GOP officials such as Mark Walker are demanding he resign. OK. Demand he resign. Where was all this outrage when Trump's “Grab ‘em by the pussy\\" remarks came to light? Or his claim that he's always trying to “fuck\\" married women? Or when he said his daughter was a “nice piece of ass\\"? Or when it came out he was paying hush money to porn stars? Or all those pictures of him pouring champagne on stretch limos and Playboy bunnies? Or when it came out he divorced wife #2 because he was having an affair with future wife #3?

Roe v Wade has made it so abortions have to be at least available. That said, each state can write laws restricting when an abortion becomes illegal and who can and cannot perform them. A resident of a state that restricts abortions is free to travel to a state where it is available."},{"prompt":"What headless CMS do you recommend using and why?","completion":"It is really difficult to recommend one CMS over another, as every CMS has some pros and cons. The first step is to understand what you need your CMS for and then select the best tool for the job. For example, if you want to create a blog, then WordPress would be a good choice. On the other hand, if you need a sophisticated website, then Kentico Kontent would be a better choice as it’s a headless CMS with various features.

So yes. Also, the accusation that the Bible supports abortion in the book of Numbers keeps coming up on Quora. It doesn’t: Numbers 5.11-31 says, in summary, that a pregnant woman suspected of unfaithfulness shall be subject to a test (drinking “bitter water”), and the people should call on God to bring about a miscarriage if she has been unfaithful. Abortion advocates insist the “bitter water” was an abortifacent drug. It doesn’t take much thought to work out that there is no point going through all the rigmarole of calling on God to perform a test if the outcome of the test is to be determined by a drug. It’s far more likely that the “bitter water” was just salty water, symbolising tears. If a miscarriage was to occur, God would induce it – no abortion by human hand was involved."},{"prompt":"w do I transfer a Word document to a PDF?","completion":"In this video, you are going to learn how to convert a Word file into a PDF.

How can I keep going along with my diet?","completion":"Most diets are designed to lose weight over the short term and have a focus on weight and not holistic health—as in nutrition and disease prevention/healing through whole plant foods. Consequently, most diets use caloric restriction and just eating less of the food that naturally leads to weight gain. Which will lead your body craving and needing more. Now, a caloric deficit is necessary to lose weight. Yet one can and ideally achieves this through actually eating more! The key to losing weight isn’t eating less, but actually eating MORE of the right foods. vegetarians, especially vegans, have consistently shown to have lower and normal BMI’s compared to omnivores or pescatarians for the main reason that they eat more fruits and vegetables which are naturally low in calories. By eating more fruits and vegetables you can eat more, fill up your stomach, and satisfy your hunger and nutritional needs, while still reaching your weight goals. a clear strategy can give us our best results. But diets often fail because they are meant to. When trying to maintain our weight it is best to approach it from an education and holistic health mindset then trying to punish ourselves just to lose a few pounds at any consequence. This is all of course easier said than done. Knowing that we should do something is NOT that same as understanding why we should do it or how to do it. But those answers are only for those who are willing to help themselves by asking for help and to Eat the Forbidden Fruit 🍎"},{"prompt":"What do you think about TVF's new show Kota Factory?","completion":"TVF’s KOTA FACTORY The Best of KOTA FACTORY !!

What is the difference in the usage in the context?","completion":"At first, let me explain the difference between present perfect continuous and past perfect continuous tense. Case I — Present Perfect Continuous Tense: Suppose, I started writing on Quora today at around 6:30 pm and I am still writing here now (at 8:19 pm). Therefore, I shall say: I have been writing on Quora today since 6:30 pm. Case II — Past Perfect Continuous Tense Suppose, I started writing here today at 6:30 pm and continued writing till 7:30 pm. However, I am not writing here now (at 8:19 pm). Therefore, I shall say: I had been writing on Quora today from 6:30 pm till 8:19 pm. Therefore, you can understand that: Present Perfect Continuous Tense:denotes an action that began some time in the recent past and is still continuing at present. Past Perfect Continuous Tense:denotes an action that had began some time in the past and continued for a certain period of time. It is not continuing now (at present). Also, we use since to denote a particular point of time and for to denote a certain period of time while using these tenses. Simple Trick — You can remember it using a simple trick. Both the tenses denote actions that began in the past but: Present perfect continuous: still continuing at present.Past perfect continuous: continued for a certain period in the past.

This is the easiest diet in the world; it is called \\"Eat-Less\\". I started a diet 18 months ago, but that fell by the wayside. I now have my head screwed on correctly, and I intend to lose the weight that I need to. From my personal experience, being obese has just become so much a part of me that I don't notice it that much any longer. The only time I may notice it is when I go to the Oversize section at clothing retailers to buy clothes. I think that the biggest mistake that society makes is type-casting obese people as being lazy which is the furthest thing from the truth. My personality dictates that what gets said behind my back is of no interest to me. If you cannot say something to my face, then \\"take it from whence it comes\\". The question \\"Why are you obese\\" never gets asked, as it has already been answered; you eat too much. There is no consideration that obesity may be a physiological problem. We cannot change how people think about the obese, but we can change the most important factor here; ourselves. We see how the thin get treated better, and we have it within our power to change our body shape so that we will be picked out in a crowd, instead of being marginalized. Luckily, we can go on a diet and lose weight, no matter how difficult that may be, but those that have preconceived ideas of the obese, or anything for that matter, are destined to remain a**holes until they die."},{"prompt":"What happened to the Balkh and Badakshan Subahs established by Shah Jahan?","completion":"It doesn’t make much sense to refer to these regions as the Balkh Subah and Badakhshan Subah given that the Mughal Empire was never able to consolidate its hold over these regions. The Blue Mosque or Masjid-i-Kabud in Mazar-i-Sharif in Balkh (Afghanistan). It was initially constructed by Sultan Husayn Bayqarah Mirza, the Timurid ruler of Khorasan, in the 15th century. The Hindu Kush mountains had served as the traditional boundary between the spheres of influence of the Mughal Empire of Hindustan to the southeast and Uzbek Khanates of Central Asia to the northwest, since the reign of the Mughal Emperor Akbar (1556 – 1605). The Mughal Empire would launch an ambitious military campaign during the reign of Shah Jahan (1628 – 1658) to expand north of the Hindu Kush towards Central Asia. The Mughals, under the pretence of bringing law and order to the region during a period of internal strife amongst the Uzbeks, invaded and captured the regions of Balkh and Badakhshan in 1646. The forces of the Mughal Empire - under the command of Aurangzeb (initially Murad Baksh) - were able to defeat the Uzbek forces in direct confrontations. However, they failed to consolidate their hold over the region. The Uzbeks resorted to raiding and harassment; that is to say skirmishing and guerrilla tactics to weaken the Mughal forces in the region. The conflict devastated the region, which was costing the Mughal Empire far more than the two provinces were worth in revenue. The large Mughal army, unable to live off the land, had to resort to expensive supply lines from Kabul. The Uzbeks were unwilling to concede the region. This stalemate of a military campaign would go on for about two years (1646 – 1647). Aurangzeb, upon orders of Shah Jahan, would lead the Mughal retreat towards Kabul. The regions of Balkh and Badakhshan were returned to the Uzbeks once more. The Mughal Empire, despite massive losses in the military and heavy financial costs, had nothing to show for it at the end. This is why I said that it doesn’t make much sense to refer to these regions as the Balkh Subah and Badakhshan Subah. The Mughal Empire captured these regions from the Uzbek Khanates for about two years (1646 – 1647) in total, before being forced to return it. Even during this small time period, the Mughals were never able to consolidate their hold over the region. These regions were Mughal provinces only in name.

But if you are an 8th grader who just enjoys playing around with math, then I might recommend the next level in your school.

But my Dad found a math test that IBM used when picking new hires. That was fun because it touched on all high school math, and I was able to complete that in a couple of hours. My Dad took it back to his friend who ran the answer sheet through the reader and I scored a 96. (This was early 1969.) So, that might be fun for you!

It masks whether there is true compatibility that can see you through the long term and isn’t sustainable so you may end up trapped with a mortgage and family a couple years in with a complete stranger you no longer love let alone like and a hell of a lot of work to do trying to keep it together for the sake of the kids, it’s unfair to everyone. Those that put on the act after the cheating, rebuilding on a bunch of lies and half truths are keeping their spouse/partner from the genuine love they deserve by keeping them in the relationship subjecting them to a life of phony reality, trust issues and triggers are usually the fate and more often than not repeat infidelity instead of setting them free so they find a genuine love.

The US may be in a recession now since we have had 2 quarters of declining GDP. We’ll see what happens. I recommend the book, Capitalism the Unknown Ideal, by Ayn Rand, a former Russian. It contains an essay, \\"What is Capitalism,\\" because the author rightly holds that most people don't know what it is.

What will be the consequences?","completion":"You would get Iphone just at 650 INR…😂😂 If 1 Rupee = 1 Dollar Pros Now Pros of the situation. 1. Buying Goods will be cheaper for Indians in the International Market. Because this will make imports cheaper which is good for a developing country. 2. Buying luxurious goods will be cheaper. For example, an iphone will cost just INR 650 which is cheaper than the current market rate. 3. As import prices are cheaper, then petrol prices will be cheaper resulting in cheaper transportation cost of goods around the country. Cons Now Cons of the Situation 1. Exports will be expensive if value of Indian rupee and dollar are the same. Because Indian products will be expensive compared to other competing nations. Indian exports have been booming well in recent years. If it is expensive, why would any country buy from India when other competitors can offer the same at cheaper price. 2. There would be no foreign Investment if Rupee equals dollar. The primary reason for a foreign investment in India is the cheapest labour cost. Foreign companies will not be investing in India when the cost of labour is higher compared to other countries. 3. Service sector contributes almost 60% in GDP and give 27% employment in India. Investment in IT Sector and Service Sector which contributes huge amount for the Indian Economy will be gone if 1 Dollar is equal to 1 Rupee. Now as 1USD= 1INR why any company will pay to an employee USD 75,000 or Rs.75,000 per month if they can hire someone outside who will do the same work for USD 3000 or Rs.3000. Eventually people will loose job which will increase unemployment. 4. When money does not come into India, it will result in complete economic slowdown. 5. Outsourcing of job in India will be stopped. 6. Companies which are presently in India will start to move out as it will not be profitable for them. Similar situation happened in India during 2007-08 when dollar was strong around Rs.40, the imports were good. But the BPO and IT Sectors suffered a lot. Verdict The situation of 1 Rupee = 1 USD is just not affordable for a growing or developing country. Thank You….😄😄"},{"prompt":"lost my email password.

With no nutrients and tons of calories, it is probably the most hazardous ingredient in the modern diet, responsible for millions of deaths. Exactly what is it? What I’m talking about here is a disaccharide, the combination of glucose and fructose. It offers zero nutritive values and no health benefits. We feel comfortable with it because most of us grew up loading it on our breakfast cereal because mom said it was OK. We can give mom a break; she didn’t know any better back in the day. When we got a bit older, we ended up shoveling it in our coffee. I remember I used to add four of five spoonfuls to one mug. How I’ve avoided diabetes, I’ll never know. Refined sugar became a daily part of our lives, and we didn’t think twice about eating it. I mean, how could something sold in five-pound bags in the grocery store be so dangerous to our health? What are some common health hazards associated with sucrose? There are several: Heart Disease - Adding extra sugar to our diet can put you at higher risk of heart disease by leading to obesity, high blood pressure, and tissue inflammation. Fatty Liver Diseases - Sucrose (and other sugars) are broken down by the liver. Consuming sucrose in excess could lead to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.Diabetes - The incidence of insulin resistance has doubled in the last 30 years. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that regulates blood sugar levels. Insulin resistance is associated with high sucrose intake and significantly increases your risk of diabetes.Obesity - Sugar can act to trick your brain into making you still feel hungry when you would otherwise feel full. Don’t believe me? Stop all excess sugar for several weeks, then eat a donut or two. After that, you’ll become ravenously hungry.Accelerated Skin Aging - The way we age is largely due to our genetics, but our diet plays a role as well. Advanced Glycation End Products(AGEs) are the compounds stimulated by a reaction between sugar and protein inside your body that also damages collagen and elastin, the agents that provide your skin with elasticity and youthfulness. The good news is that if one wants to, it is relatively easy to eliminate added sugars from our diet.

To my knowledge, there were not any election sites that predicted a 100% chance for a Clinton win. Even if they predicted 99%+ odds for a Clinton victory, that wouldn’t prove them wrong, as things with less 1% chance of happening, happen all the time. Of course, while this fact demonstrates their possible accuracy, it also demonstrates a pretty serious flaw. Probability predictions for presidential elections are fundamentally unfalsifiable. If someone had predicted that Trump had a 99% chance of winning, I’d say they were probably BSing and got lucky. But the election results didn’t prove them wrong, nor would it have proved someone predicting a 99% chance for Clinton wrong. If the results cannot prove who was right between those two extremes, they certainly cannot prove who was right between 538’s 70% chance for Clinton, and other sites giving Clinton 90%. It’d be tempting to say the results showed 538 was closer to the truth, but for all we know something with a 10% probability happened. And with presidential elections only happening once every four years, one could be making predictions for decades and still have a very small data-set. And most of the time were talking about prediction numbers in the weeks and months before a election, rather than on election day itself. These tell us that there is X percentage that Y candidate would win if the election was held on that day. But since the election is not held on that day there will be zero results to prove or falsify the prediction. Some of these sites seem really smart because they throw lots of numbers at you. But ultimately, they could be total BS and there would little way to prove it."},{"prompt":"w should I save my money?

Their century-old fight for rights, autonomy, and even an independent Kurdistan that admittedly don’t have an all Kurdish support has been marked by persecution Assyrian Christians — often simply referred to as Assyrians — are an ethnic minority group whose origins lie in the Assyrian Empire, a major power in the ancient Middle East. Most of the world’s 2-4 million Assyrians live around their traditional homeland, which comprises parts of northern Iraq, Syria, Turkey and Iran. The first Eurasian populations were established on the The Arabian Peninsula, the initial site of the out-of-Africa migrations that occurred between 125,000 and 60,000 yr ago, leading to the hypothesis that Arabs are direct descendants of these ancient peoples. According to both Judaism and Islam, Ishmael was the ancestor of the Ishmaelites and of the Arabs. Ishmael was the elder son of Abraham and the forefather of many prominent Arab tribes. Currently it gathers 22 Arab countries: Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria*, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Around 93% of Arabs are Muslims, while the rest are mainly Arab Christians. There are two major branches of Islam – Sunni and Shia. The overwhelming majority (87-90%) of Muslims are Sunnis; about 10-13% are Shia Muslims. Most of the ancient Persian empire is in modern-day Iran. The Persians are the predominant ethnic group of Iran who comprise over half of the population of Iran. They share a common cultural system and are native speakers of the Persian language (Farsi), which belongs to the Indo-Iranian group of the Indo-European language family. Medieval Persian incorporated more Arabic loanwords, had a more complex grammar, used the Arabic script with modifications, and had slightly different pronunciation compared to Modern Persian."},{"prompt":"w much money can you make online?","completion":"Hey there! So you want to know how much you can earn with a blog, huh? Well, the truth is, it really depends on various factors. Let me share my own blogging journey to give you a better idea. I started my blog a few years ago, writing about my passion for travel and adventure. At first, it was just a hobby, and I didn't make much money. But as I kept consistently putting out valuable content and building a loyal audience, things started to change. I began to collaborate with travel companies and hotels, receiving sponsorships and freebies for promoting their services on my blog. This opened up a new stream of income. Additionally, I dived into affiliate marketing, recommending products and services I genuinely believed in, and earning a commission for every sale made through my affiliate links. As my blog gained popularity, I even started selling my own digital products, like travel guides and photography presets. All these efforts combined led to a substantial increase in my blog's income over time. Remember, blogging isn't a get-rich-quick scheme, and it takes time, dedication, and a lot of hard work. But if you're passionate about what you write, stay consistent, and focus on providing value to your audience, you'll likely see your earnings grow steadily.

Do we observe the objects that comprise reality, receiving the meaning inherent to the objects? Or do we interact with reality and observe that interaction allowing us to make distinctions about reality that are meaningful to us? That is to say, do we create the idea of the the objects we observe as a consequence of our interaction with reality? If the objects meaning is inherent to the object, then identity problems become very stick. In fact, all definition becomes a problem, but it’s just most obvious in the cases of identity. In this was of seeing reality, the ship’s Theseusness is being observed by us. The question becomes what is it about the ship that’s inherently Theseusish. The paradox demonstrates that this is not easy to answer. Maybe there is an answer, but I’m not so interested in finding it. If we decide that the meaning of objects arises out of the subjects interaction with reality, then the problem is easier to solve. The answer is that Theseus’ ship is his ship when it’s meaningful to us for it to be his ship. This allows us to hold the seemingly contradictory opinions about when it’s Theseus's ship. This answer seems to be compatible with Joshua Engel’s answer. but we took different approaches to it.

The easiest for me is aluminum. I have my favorite which is 7075T6 mainly because the chips break better than all the rest of the aluminum series. Magnesium is very easy to machine but doesn\`t dissipate the heat very well and you cannot let chips build up in the pan or scrap barrel because those fine cuts will catch fire and cannot be put out…sustained…yes, but not out until it burns itself out. Copper is not bad and tricky to get a really good finish if you have to use inserted carbide tool with factory rake and clearance angle…if you happen to have a tool & cutter grinder the angles can be to perfection. Yes, I had access to several grinders. I love machining brass because the chips will break without special tools, however, drilling brass requires a negative hook angle on the drill bit to prevent it from grabbing when breaking through a hole. All the materials mentioned can be machines with high speed or cobalt tools. Carbide can be used if sharpened right. Titanium (not mentioned) is a pleasant material to machine, and it can be machined with high-speed steel as long as the cutting angles are correct. (Actually, just plain tool steel machines titanium with aluminum angles better than carbide negative rake inserted tools.)

I have been in management and leadership positions in the military and business world for forty years and I often get asked what the best lessons I have found. Surprisingly (or not) my list of lessons probably have varied to a degree, depending on when in my career it was constructed. The following lessons represent my favorite lessons on business management that I believe could make the biggest impact. If I was starting my career over and could take leadership lessons back in time with me, these are the ones I would choose: Create an environment of continuous learning It is absolutely necessary that business people be good learners. They need to instill this in all their team. They must learn from their mistakes. To be most successful, managers must acknowledge, understand, and improve on their shortcomings. And they must encourage their team to also focus on continuous learning. Be a multiplier Multiplier business managers know that at the apex of the intelligence hierarchy is NOT the lone genius. Rather, it is the genius who knows the importance of bringing out the smarts and capabilities in everyone on the team. Related material: [LINKED_TEXT: Lessons Learned in Life … Class Continues Daily] [URL: http://digitalsparkmarketing.com/employeeslessons-learned-in-life/] Build connections Both managers and leaders know their job with their teams is about building lots of connections. They make people feel they have a stake in common problems. Encourage feedback It is vital that you let your team know you are interested and will listen to their concerns and ideas and contribute to solutions to any and all problems. Offer recognition and always share success Focus on building team confidence by publicly recognizing their efforts and achievements. Think of it this way; anything is possible if you share the glory. Giving others a chance to claim credit is an easy, and effective, way to magnify results. Be decisive One of the key jobs of a manager is to be an effective decision-maker. Employees are never comfortable with managers who make slow decisions and frequently change their minds. Quality managers make decisions quickly and stick with them. Building and maintaining trust Always do what you say and set good examples. Demand from yourself the same level of professionalism and dedication that you expect from others. Trust, once broken, is seldom restored to its original state. It is the most fragile yet essential attribute of leadership and management.

They both have advantages over one another in terms of appearance, durability, etc. Marble vs. Granite Durability: [LINKED_TEXT: Granite] [URL: https://rynestone.in/collections/granite-manufacturers-and-suppliers-in-india] is more resilient and long-lasting than marble. The hardest natural stone is frequently compared to marble. Due to its heat resistance and ability to easily handle hot cookware, it is perfect for kitchen tops. Marble is also susceptible to color fading and dulling over time. Unlike stains, which may be recovered, a stone that has lost its brightness cannot. The fundamental problem with marble is that this process is ongoing. Both natural stones are reactive to acidic substances, although marble is more porous due to its metamorphic features. As a result, spills, especially those involving acidic liquids like fruit juices and wines, can quickly harm marble. Granite and marble have quite different appearances from one another. Due to the inclusion of feldspar, mica, and amphibole in the granite, the stone's color variation appears as speckling all over. Marble, on the other hand, has a greyish or cream color and has veins running through it. Contaminants like iron oxide are frequently to blame for marble veining. Applications: Granite is more appropriate for kitchen counters and hallways where there is heavy foot traffic while marble is more suitable for locations with lesser foot traffic, such as restrooms. Since marble has a distinctive, bright appearance, it is perfect for surfaces that see less traffic. Cost: Professional installation of granite and marble is required due to the weight of the slabs. While high grade granite is less expensive than marble, both materials typically cost 50 to 100. The type of tile utilized, the difficulty of the job, and the stone's quality, however, all affect the final price. Maintenance: Sealants are applied to both marble and granite to prevent etching and stains. Professionals recommend sealing marble twice a year, although granite only needs it done every two years. Marble requires sealing much more frequently. Depending on how frequently the stone was cleaned and how frequently it was used, it may or may not need to be resealed."},{"prompt":"Why aren't bullets sharp?","completion":"Ever put your finger through a wet paper towel?"},{"prompt":"WW2?

My problem with the Avengers has been they obviously had Scarlett Johansson in a tight catsuit for eye-candy. She didn’t have super powers, and she looked nothing like the Natasha from the comics, but she was always there. Note: Natasha wasn’t an original Avenger in the comics, nor was she ever with them for very long. Wasp and Wanda were the OG female Avengers. Neither Liz Olson nor Brie Larson is hootchie-mama hot (although they maintain a low-cut bustier on Wanda.) Thank God. These two women are certainly lovely, but they are serious actors first.

The modern elements are much less disruptive and far smaller volumes than in the past. And for every panic-stricken article written about lithium shortages there are ten articles on the back pages of publications most people don’t read about alternative technologies which allow storage without lithium at all. Same for all the other rare elements. And there are some stories about new production in other countries. You may not know that Australia, not Africa and not China, is presently the world’s largest source of lithium. These elements are found many places. Humans just tend to go where the concentrations are highest and the formations are easiest to exploit first. I’m not in any way a fan of extractive industries. But if we want a sustainable world we have to build one that people will accept. They aren’t going to accept going back to horse and buggy days, as much as the Republicans talk about that in their failed effort to slow progress. So we might want to tolerate an electric car which needs between five and 165 pounds of lithium, as a pleasant alternative to a car which burns that much weight and volume of gasoline every couple of days for the entire time it is on the road.

A theme is a pre-designed template that determines your site's layout, colors, and overall appearance. There are thousands of free and paid WordPress themes to choose from. You can browse themes from the WordPress theme directory or purchase a premium theme from a marketplace such as ThemeForest. Look for a theme that is responsive, easy to customize, and matches your brand's style and tone. Step 4: Install Plugins Plugins are add-ons that extend WordPress's functionality. There are over 50,000 free and paid plugins available, so you can find one for almost any feature or task you need. Popular plugins include Yoast SEO for search engine optimization, Jetpack for website security and performance, and Contact Form 7 for creating contact forms. To install a plugin, navigate to the Plugins section in the WordPress dashboard and search for the plugin you want. Click \\"Install\\" and \\"Activate\\" to activate the plugin on your site. Step 5: Create Content Once you have a theme and plugins installed, you can start creating content. Content can include pages, posts, images, and videos. To create a page, navigate to the Pages section in the WordPress dashboard and click \\"Add New.\\" You can add text, images, and videos to your page and customize its layout using your theme's options.

Step 7: Launch Your Site Once you've created content and optimized your site for SEO, you're ready to launch your site. Before launching, make sure to test your site's functionality, responsiveness, and speed on different devices and browsers. To launch your site, simply make it live on your hosting provider.

Here are a few suggestions to maximize the positive and minimize the negative: In your scenario, the VC is packing up. Odds are good they have to get someplace, so do not engage them in a way that will take a lot of time.Tell them your name, odds are they'll ask what you do. Describe your business in ONE SENTENCE only. If they ask for more, great. If not, move on to...Pithy exchange idea #1: if you know that you and they know someone in common, reference that person (\\"Mary Jones says great things about you. She recently signed on to my startup's advisory board\\")Pithy exchange idea #2: if they are an active blogger and you liked something they wrote, let them know.Pithy exchange idea #3: if you know something about investments they've made that you think are great businesses, let them know, esp. if you have some valuable perspective on that business (\\"You've invested in SaaSCo, right? I've got a friend at Acme Corp who's trialing their service, and is finding it valuable\\").DON'T try to pitch them your business unless they ask you to. Instead, just let them know that you'd love their perspectives on the business you and your team are building, and ask if you can send a follow-up e-mail with information about it.Then let them go. Short and sweet, leave a good impression, build in follow-up activities.

His eyes were gooey and he was limping. He was already 2 years old so I knew this day was coming. With small animals, they can go downhill quickly. So I called my mom and asked if I could take him to a vet. Unfortunately, the only vet with an opening who also treated small animals was an hour drive away. I didn’t want my little friend to suffer for possibly days, waiting for him to pass. Now, I don’t drive for medical reasons and my mom had a prior appointment so her boyfriend offered to take me. They’ve been together for 20+ years, so he’s basically my step-dad. I’ve always loved him and respected him, he’s been nothing but wonderful to my family. But that day I was humbled by his actions, and discovered an even deeper respect and appreciation for him I didn’t know was even possible. He drove me and my hamster to the emergency vet an hour away and never complained once. We got there at 11am and didn’t get home until 8pm. My hamster was considered low-priority so they called me shortly after admitting him and told me that while he was stable, they still wanted the vet to look at him but would be a few hours of waiting. When I asked my step-dad if he would rather just go home, he told me he would do whatever I wanted to do. He told me to not worry about him because he knows how important my animals are to me. I apologized and he insisted there was nothing to apologize for. We waited in the car for hours and eventually they called me again to say it would be even more of a delay. Again, I asked him if he would rather leave and again, he told me “It’s completely up to you, if you’d like to stay then I will stay with you”. I decided to stay because I knew it was time for my hamster to go, and didn’t want to bring him home only to slowly suffer. My step-dad then took me out to dinner wherever I wanted to go and of course, insisted on paying for everything. When we called my mom to tell her we would be there for awhile, she urged him to take me home to which he replied “she wants to stay so I’ll stay with her. I don’t mind at all.” I kept apologizing, and he would just say “there’s nothing to apologize for. This is important to you.” He never complained once. Not at having to drive an hour away, not for having to wait for 8 hours in a car, not for feeding me, nothing. He never said I was wasting his time or that he had other plans for the day. He never said it was a hassle or silly of me to care so much about a 10 hamster. To him it was just the same as if I had asked him to take me around the corner to the drive thru. Later on he even took me to a gas station to get snacks (which of course he paid for). When I finally got the news that my hamster was on the way out and I needed to make a decision, he started to tear up because he saw me crying (he wasn’t really an animal person, he never had a pet until a few years ago). Of course I made the decision to let my little friend cross the rainbow bridge peacefully. When we got home, I went upstairs to get a sturdy box to bury him in our yard. Without prompting, my step-dad got a shovel and a flashlight and dug a deep hole in the dark right next to where I buried my other hamster years ago. I was fully prepared to do the work myself but he did it for me ahead of time. He patiently waited while I cried and said my goodbye, and let me throw the first pile of dirt over the box. When I told him I wasn’t sure if I was strong enough to fill in the rest, he took the shovel and filled it in for me, packing it down better than I would have been able to so that animals wouldn’t dig him up. He hugged me and asked me if there was anything he could do for me. But he had already done so much, probably more than he even knows. I realized that day that he did so much for my family and I and has never asked for anything in return. He treated me with respect and understanding even though he probably didn’t understand my attachment to such a small creature. He handled it all with patience, strength, and care. It was the most masculine, upstanding thing I have seen and I could not be more grateful for such a wonderful father-figure. In a month he will be attending my college graduation when my own father will not be there (who suddenly claims he doesn’t like driving out of town). Even at my high school graduation, when I waited and waited for my dad to show so I could get a picture with him in my cap and gown, my step-dad made sure to be there. We have a picture of us together outside the ceremony. He’s done so much for a child that’s not even his and I feel so lucky that my mom hit the jackpot. Here he is laughing at the World’s Largest Pencil Sharpener Collection he happened to find on a trip a few years ago."},{"prompt":"What are the best ways to invest money?","completion":"Determining the best ways to invest money depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, investment timeframe, and personal circumstances. Here are some general investment strategies that are often considered: Diversify your portfolio: Spreading your investments across different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities, can help reduce risk. Diversification can be achieved through mutual funds, ETFs, or by investing directly in various assets.Invest in low-cost index funds: Index funds are designed to replicate the performance of a specific market index, such as the S&P 500. They offer broad market exposure, low fees, and are suitable for long-term investing. This approach aims to capture the overall market's growth rather than trying to beat it through active stock selection.Consider dollar-cost averaging: Instead of investing a lump sum at once, dollar-cost averaging involves investing a fixed amount regularly over time. This strategy can help mitigate the impact of market volatility by purchasing more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when prices are high.Invest in tax-advantaged accounts: Take advantage of tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s, IRAs, or ISAs (depending on your country), which offer tax benefits and can help grow your investments more efficiently. These accounts may provide tax deductions, tax-free growth, or tax-free withdrawals, depending on the specific account type.Consider your risk tolerance: Understand your risk tolerance and invest accordingly. Riskier investments, such as stocks or venture capital, can potentially provide higher returns but also come with greater volatility and the possibility of losses. If you have a lower risk tolerance, you may prefer more conservative options like bonds or stable dividend-paying stocks.Educate yourself and consider professional advice: Stay informed about investing principles, market trends, and economic factors that may affect your investments. Consider seeking advice from financial professionals, such as financial advisors or wealth managers, who can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances and goals. Remember, investing always carries some level of risk, and there are no guaranteed outcomes. It's essential to do your research, evaluate your financial situation, and consider seeking professional advice to make informed investment decisions.

Made with tender coconut pulp mixed with condensed milk, this quick version of kheer is a brilliant addition to your daily meals. Ashok halwa (or Asoka halwa) is a delicious dessert from Tamil Nadu that is made on special occasions. One can call it a south Indian version of moong dal halwa, but the difference is that moong dal halwa is crumbly and dry while ashoka halwa is more watery with a glossy, shiny look. Muskoth halwa is prepared using Maida milk / All purpose flour milk and coconut milk. It can be called as coconut milk halwa too. Highlight of this halwa is its made without adding a drop of ghee or oil. The oil releases from the coconut milk makes the halwa glossy and flavorful. Thoothukudi macaroon is a type of macaroon from the port town of Thoothukudi, in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, influenced by Portuguese.

I want them as companions for humans.","completion":"For companion animals, I would recommend getting goats as long as you have the proper fencing and facilities. This is very important as goats are escape artists. They are also very smart and can be trained to be as friendly and companionable as dogs. That said, you need to be aware of natural goat behavior. They are escape artists and that lovely rose bush on the other side of the fence is usually just the right enticement to make them think about escape. They also are very good at working out how gate latches work so you need to be creative in your gate latch. A sliding one is best as they are very good at figuring out the hook and eye ones. Also you will need at least a 5 foot fence or electric. This fence needs to be sheep fencing so they cannot wiggle through it. A wire strung at their eye level is a good deterrent. Also, goats will tend to get on anything that is higher than the ground. It is a natural instinct to be able to look for predators. Old wooden cable rolls are very fun for them to play on and fun for people to watch as well. Goats are browsers so while they can do well on a grass pasture, they do better on a weedy field with lots of brush. They are masters at clearing out blackberry vines. Anyway, goats are characters as you can see from the photo below.

To begin with, there’s a 20-minute wait, the speed is much slower and one can actually find a place to sit without six people standing on your foot, while a seventh tries to steal your wallet. The proverbial south Indian efficiency (and courtesy) is on display at most places from booking clerks who genuinely try to help you out and call you “sir” to medical specialists who diagnose your ailment correctly without recommending a battery of tests. (In fact, the concept of a corporatised hospital was first mooted in the south.) By way of conversation, most statements begin with “Can you do me a favour?” and end with “is it?” Sometimes they include, “Are you a north Indian/ Punjabi/ Muslim etc?” added unabashedly, without batting an eyelid. Needless to say, the term north Indian includes anything from Kutch to Kohima. Although this is unlikely to find any (Pic-Movie posters often leave you questioning who is the hero!) mention in the Lonely Planet or any of the politically correct discussions on national integration, there has always been an unsurmountable schism between the north and south; even a covert sense of hostility. Quite simply, the south thinks that the north consists of a bunch of pushy, garrulous types with more money and clout than what’s good for them, while the north feels that the south comprises a bunch of gibberish speaking, clerical techies whose sole aim is to come up north for work and subsequently get their entire clan to join them. The IT factor is of course extremely prevalent down under. It’s believed that you can’t throw a rock anywhere without hitting a techie. Then again, there are those who will actually attempt to verify the hypothesis. Don’t even attempt pronouncing the full names of people or you’ll end up missing your train. Fortunately, most names have a shorter version. (Long before Jurassic Park came up with the T-Rex, Madras came up with T-nagar and RA Puram.) Years of practice has honed the cognitive skills of local kids who, now settled in the US, regularly win spelling bee contests. (Let’s face it, for any kid who’s grown up having Thiruvalluvarnagar for a zip code, anything would be a cinch.) If there’s one thing that epitomises the city, it’s the huge cardboard cutouts of political figures like Puratchi Thalaivi “fat lady” amma and other assorted appas, bearing gargantuan hernia-inducing garlands. After several attempts at trying to unsuccessfully convince a telephone operator to talk in English, I realise that what she’s been saying, rather exasperatedly is actually, “I am talking in English!” (In fact, the credit for the original expression, “I yam what I yam,” wrongly attributed to Popeye the sailor, actually goes to Parasuram the tender coconut vendor.) Movies are big business in the south, though going by the handlebar moustaches, drooping eyelids, glazed retinas and glaring looks, it’s often difficult to tell the heroes from the villains on the posters. The south Indian heroine (whose thighs have for long been the envy of north Indian wrestlers) has come a long way. From a generously endowed, conservative, Kanjeevaram-clad amma with half the Botanical Gardens in her hair, who looked like she tucked away a good six tins of asli ghee daily; she has morphed into this demure, diminutive, Demi Moore type. What’s next — Humphrey Bogart in Casablancapuram saying, “Here’s looking at you, Kutty?” Play it again, Sambaswami! ————————————————————————————————————- One Reader’s Reply for the above article Is it fair for Ammirror to publish columns which hurts millions of people? If it is so, the below is 360 degree feedback to a column written by Mr.Dastoor \\"Play it again, Sambaswami\\" in page 24 on May12,2010. This feedback will also hurt others. 1.South India: The term south India includes atleast four states, Tamilnadu, Kerala, AP and Karnataka. Unfortunately for Mr.Dinyar, Madras is south India. It is like a blindman describing elephant, by touching hair of its tail. Whether Mr.Dinyar is aware that, Madras is Chennai now. 2.INR or NIR : INR is Indian Rupee. What is that North Indian Rupee making its appearance - while affluent South is counting remittances in of US, Singapore and Australia and Euros. In which decade he lives? Whether he is aware, there are atleast three currencies carry Tamil - there is no north Indian Rupee. 3.Blessing in Disguise:Thanks to Hindi agitations, which restricted tamilians to migrate to north due to langauage and now they emerged as global citizens spreading their wings. 4.Think Different: In chennai if anyone is speaking, shudh rashtrabhasa, untoubtedly he would have migrated from north India. [again hair of an elephant tail] 5.Recent Think Tanks: Quite simply south thinks that the north consists of a bunch of kandhu vatti [lazy people who thrive by lending money at 60 to 96% interest] joint families, who stay with their entire clan for generations and wash their sins by visiting holy places. South clerical techies often wonder how dirty these north Indian towns are - where is the question of migrating with kith and clan. Am I dreaming Butterfly or Butterfly dreams of me: 9% of people in Tamilnadu speaks telugu and 1 out of 39 elected MP from Madurai since independence is a saurashtrian representing about 2% of people. The telugu speaking descedents came from Vijayanagar protected our Temples from Muslim attacks. Saurashtra is a language similar to sweet Gujarati written with tamil alphabets and their contribution to Silk weaving is commendable. Indians are mainly farmers as majority of the people mentioned farming as a profession during last census. In this census, it will not be surprising, if freelancing will emerge as a major proffesion in North. 6.Classical Language: Ofcourse they are proud about their langauge -one of classical two languages of our holy land; unadulterated language of Lord Kartik; grammered by Agasthiya rishi to create certain vibrations; still spoken by over 60 million people - though others who cannot understand may tell gibberish. It is a simple fact that north Indians don't even attempt pronouncing the south Indian names - is it fair to expect south Indians to master so called adulterated rashtrabhasa representing our slavery. We need to accept, that we cannot straigten dog's tail. 7.Owners Never Complained: English is a foreign langauge - why to expect a female telephone operator to talk in English. [again hair of an elephant tail]. English nationals have no problem in understanding south Indian accent but NI do have. 8.Crazy :Education is a biggest business [evil] in the south, not the movies. South Indians are crazy people in seeing movies, music... A vibrant cutout industry, music & film industry of their own mother tongue are symbols of developed state - this next generation Dastoors can only grasp. 9.Still More Difficult :Mr.Dinyar find it difficult to tell the heroes from the villains on the posters. South Indians find it difficult to tell the heroes from heroines in hindi movies as both have \\"no moustaches\\". How one generation watched all \\"kapurs\\" and present generation \\"khans\\"? Can we find any nativity in hindi - all urdu dialogues again representing our slavery. In one talk show, it is recorded that, north Indian males are not looking \\"manly\\". 10.Thigh Thakka Thigh:Whether Mr.Dinyar aware that 90% of south Indian heroines are from north India. Like super Star Rajnikanth, MGR, Khusboo South Indians like all talents. Now Mr.Dinyar should understand, that those thighs are from north Indian wrestlers and it is a pity they have not seen their thighs before mirros. 11.Revisitng Organic Way:Wearing flowers and applying oils is south Indian culture. It is an organic way and better than applying deodarant all over the non-bath body; and doing a spa. Nothing wrong in attempting to become Demi moore!!!

On more than one occassion I've parked at a gas station and I've witnessed a car just empty all there trash onto the ground, within inches of a waste bin and drive off.

This had laxer safety regulations which made building like that cheaper to build. One of those regulations meant that they needed a thinner layer of fireproofing around the shafts for key services, such as fire escapes and the central building supports. Also they could get by with fewer fire escape staircases than would be required elsewhere. (Particularly significant in the North Tower as people above the floor of impact had no way down as the staircase was blocked). The main support of the building was steel. Any Blacksmith from the dawn of the Iron Age will know that iron and steel get softer and malleable at high temperatures. When that steel is supporting twenty or thirty floors of a building above the point where it starts to get soft, it will soon cease to support. As floors come crashing down, each floor adds to the impact on the next floor down and it collapses like a series of pancakes. The planes hijacked were planes which were going to cross the Continent and had a lot of fuel on board. Jet fuel burns hot, more than hot enough for the steel supporting the building to soften enough to lost the ability to support the weight above the impact site. Appalling thogh the crime was, they were very well informed. Other tower blocks in New York would have lasted longer due to more fireproof protection, giving more people time to get out due to the additional escape routes. The World Trade Centre gave those on the upper floors next to no chance of survival."},{"prompt":"What will happen if 1 will be equal to 1 rupee? What will be the consequences?","completion":"If one dollar will get equals to Rs.1 you can not even imagine what would be the conditions of indian economy. Our economy will completely destroyed. India is import oriented country where we Imports more compared to export. So in order to pay our high import oil, gold and other items bill we need to pay them in dollor and for it we required foreign currency reserve and to get the foreign currency we need other international market to import our good ( Export for us) for this our goods should be cheaper for this our currency value should also be lower. But suppose if one dollor is equal to one rupee then who so ever will buy the products from india same things they will buy from other country where currency rates are cheaper or else he would buy the same product from USA only. Thus our export will be lower and Import will be higher. Thus the current account deficit of our country will be no longer positive and than how we will be in the condition which we cannot even think about it. Lot of international companies and industrialists are coming and investing in India just beacuse of cheap availability of labour and factory setup. And this investment is very much required for a country like India to develop its infrastructure. Here if one rupee is equal to one dollar than why foreign companies would coming to India and will invest here instead of it they will prefer to invest in USA only or else they would go to more chepar country. For more clarity of your concept lets take an exapmle of bpo kpo services. Millions of Indians people are working in this BPO companises i.e. Genpact, Accenture, Wipro, Infosys etc. So what these companies are doing they are working for companies based on UK and USA. so why these companies in UK and US are giving jobs to india. Is it that they dont have the people to work for them? Is it, If you are thinking like that then you are wrong because If a USA company hiring a US employee than they will have to at least pay them for 4000–5000 per month whereas they get the same work done by outsourcing them to Indian BPO at low labor cost of around 300-400. So you can think how much they are saving. But the fact is that we are getting employment for millions of people for them. But the income is relevant here 300–400 is sufficent for a you g graduate.

I fail to see how taking the gender neutrality present in every single other general dating app and shelving the responsibility on women to make the first move is feminist or empowering. If a woman wants to message a man on Tinder, she can. She also has the option of waiting until a decent man messages her. Bumble literally takes away her options under the guise of feminism. Granted, there are benefits to Bumble’s approach in that women can’t just get unsolicited dick pics from anyone she herself hasn’t messages, but it’s still a loss in functionality. Requiring women to make the first move isn’t really empowering. It’s a requirement if anything is to get done. It’s like making volunteer work a graduation requirement. It’s not really volunteer work now, is it? It’s a fun little reversal though since it means that women get the fun experience of coming up with interesting openers while the guy gets a taste of the expectation of her not being boring (as said in the article.)

But you have to read to the end of the chapter and read carefully to catch it. Lot’s story ends with these same daughters raping him in a cave. So the man who went to Sodom and Gomorrah because he was driven by money, dies penniless; being raped by the same daughters that he carelessly offered up for rape. It's a powerful illustration of how important it is to interpret moments of stories in their context. Especially in Genesis which often makes it's points through subtle, dramatic irony rather than large pronouncements from on high. To further this point: Abraham is often viewed as a hero for bargaining with God in Chapter 18- seemingly making sure that God will not destroy innocent people in Sodom and Gomorrah. But Abraham's real motivation is to try and rescue his nephew Lot. And the resulting narrative proves again and again that Lot (and family) is far from innocent. Abraham's preoccupation with Lot is part of a much larger narrative, where Abraham seeks to establish his own heir rather than trusting in God’s promise of son through Sarah. The specific result of Abraham's mistrust is that the descendents of the rape of Lot are the Amonites and Moabites- who will have significant conflicts with the Israelites."},{"prompt":"What was your reason for leaving a tremendous tip at a restaurant?","completion":"Not me but the late, great Kerry Packer who was a very wealthy Australian businessman.

In India, for example, an SME is defined as a company with annual revenues of up to Rs. 250 crore (~US34 million) and a net worth of up to Rs. 100 crore (~US13.5 million). The SME IPO market in India is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and is designed to provide a platform for smaller companies to raise capital from the public and enable them to achieve greater visibility and credibility in the market. However, it's worth noting that the annual revenue threshold for SMEs can vary depending on the country and the industry.

This is more of a cult internet phenomenon than an actual real clinical thing. If you read actual case studies done on real psychopaths this becomes abundantly obvious. Their motives are much different because of the way their brain thinks so they just don’t understand what drives or motives normal people. They can manipulate because they know people will respond certain ways to emotional manipulation which may have been the way they were able to get their needs met as a child. This isn’t mystical witchcraft, there are real and logical reasons these coping mechanisms happen, it’s not because you are born with a certain type of brain or genetics, this obviously plays a role but there are usually psychological reasons maladaptive behaviors emerge and it’s usually because of maladaptive parenting and poor environments. I learned to read moods, not read people like some sort of fucking detective Sherlock Holmes or whatever but I was sensitive to moods because I was raised by a highly volatile and manipulative father who would rip your head off if he was in a bad mood or maybe let you get away with whatever if in a good mood, he also like to fuck with you by pretending to do nice things or be nice just to pull the rug out from under you to “teach you a lesson” to trust people which has obviously led to me not being able to trust people having good intentions and suspect anterior motives in everyone.

They are described with precise physical accuracy long before science ‘discovered’ in the 1830s these “terrible lizards”. For example, a dragon is described breathing fire in Job 41:19, and a brontosaurus is depicted in Job 40:15 with a tail which would remind viewers of the cedars of Lebanon, similar to our Redwoods and Giant Sequoias. A tail like that isn’t found on a hippo or elephant! Today, one can find photos and videos of live dinosaurs like Mokele Mbembe. Leonardo Da Vinci (15 April 1452 – 2 May 1519) painted a dinosaur (1517–18’) identified as the Lessemsauridae (in the prosauropods / sauropodomorphs category). On the same sheet of paper he depicts a cat and a lion (which he drew in an Italian zoo). All must have been drawn from direct observations for how could he have otherwise drawn a Lessemsauridae so anatomically accurate?

Till now no media house has provided compensation to them. 3)Media personalities with agenda:Every media house has its agenda.And I hate them most who keeps their agenda above their country.Examples of such persons are Miss Burkha Dutt,Mr Rajdeep Sardesai.Seldonm will you find Miss Burkha Dutt xspeaking for country.She even went to the extent of saying that “Army is there as they get salaries”.Rajdeep sardesai has an anti Hindu agenda.They are selective in their [LINKED_TEXT: reporting.] [URL: http://reporting.to/] To them secularism equals appeasement.Rajdeep Sardesai is so biased that he will not even praise the good things of Modi Government.

So long story short, I’m a student or say GATE Aspirant going forth and back from Library to Home. Mind noticing ‘Library to Home’ not ‘Home to Library’. So during the whole time in library sometimes it makes me uncomfortable on my seat and also ya uncomfortable mind with opposing task of it’s choice which is - STUDY. Not reading but study. I love reading but not just the disciple I’m assigned with. Haha, true with everyone. So accordingly I change place for a change, Somewhen in separate cabin for better lighting, sometimes near a opening by gate for natural light. So the second place I described open upto like balcony, not proper but yeah. So there’s some extra stuffs has been lying around as typical Indian habits. But that’s not the thing, the thing which caught my attention some couple days back was- not a thing but a creature who’s gonna bring some other creatures in this balcony, I mean World. You got that- a Pregnant Pigeon, of course female. So everyday it had been routine for me to check her before going home and after coming here. Sometimes when I go at that seat I put some edible things which I am sure it has not even touched yet, coz I see those item still kept there. So now I has stopped putting extra item coz they will go waste, as Mother Pigeon hasn’t trusted me yet. Ah tough Mothers. So 1–2 days ago, since it has started rainy season here, Mother Pigeon got in some trouble. For my daily check up at it, I checked it and saw Mother Pigeon was soaking wet. But that’s not only thing which made my inner instincts googly but that my MOTHER PIGEON HAS REALLY BECOME MOTHER BY NOW!!! And was soaking wet, also notice. I went all googly, left my Maths class very fastly writing, went in Office and asked bhaiya for some cardboard and so. As it was raining heavily and I don’t trust myself with these emergency moments. I didn’t want to ruin all for her. Bhaiya said me to wait for a little. After a while he returned with two wooden pieces and I becoming anxious took duty on me. And started putting in guard. Till then Mother Pigeon flew away but still keeping an eye on me. Told you, trust issues with Mothers. I tried to put them in all different ways. All dangerous coz they might fall on Baby Pigeons. Also I was thinking Mother Pigeon now would not come to them as I read a story like this in my 9th class Hindi Book. Bhaiya instructed me to put an Advertisement Hoarding lying there. Indian Habitual elements such like also helpful sometimes. I thought this at that very moment. And shifted everything. And came back to my seat. And checking and praying for Mother Pigeon to come as I didn’t want New born Baby Pigeons to be abandoned coz of my stupidity. And guess what, Mother Pigeon didn’t flew away in while being in rain but still keeping an eye on me. Uff, these Mothers’ trust issues. Look, You can watch the water falling from roof through pipe (rain is unnoticeable in photo). But to my safe heart, Mother Pigeon returned to Baby Pigeons. Hihi, what a relief. But still checking surroundings after landing. Hshhh, These Mothers, WITH TRUST ISSUES. Look, But finally, Mother Pigeon met My baby Pigeons. OfcOuRsE my Pigeons, dude you owe me a good treat. I saved your newborn body from water. You were shivering like ewyuyuhu. Huhh, little ones. Haha. Here’s final picture of Family together. It’s not clear. Bye. To be honest, this didn’t make me happy. This just made me smiley for some of time being. I don’t know how these silly things make people happy for whole day.

If so, what did you do and did you stay in the child’s life?","completion":"This was a story from the news many years ago and was even the basis for an episode of one of those lawyer-based TV shows. This guy finds out his wife is cheating after many years of marriage and three kids. He dumps her. Due to her cheating he gets full custody. You can guess where this is going. I’ll skip the details but during the course of lengthy divorce and battle, he comes to find out that none of the kids are his. We’re talking about a teen, a pre-teen, and the youngest maybe 7 or 8; and none of them knew the truth. He tried his best to continue being their dad but he just couldn’t do it. And the ex refused to reveal the identity of the father. Anyway he manages to get the kids moved back in with the ex. But the courts ruled he still had to pay child support on all three until they turned 18. In the old days he could have gotten out of it and maybe been able to sue her. But over time the courts have shifted toward doing whatever is best for the kids. In this case the thinking is that since he bonded with them as the father, he accepted that responsibility; paternity irrelevant. Laws vary from state to state but in many cases this paternal bond only takes as little as a few months to form. So gents, it just might be worth it to privately and quietly verify that you are indeed the real daddy as soon as the baby is born. I know it sounds drastic but 50% of marriages end in divorce. DNA tests are cheap and easy to do; and well worth it to alleviate any shred of doubt you have or may come to have over the years. FWIW"},{"prompt":"What is Bootstrap?

Now let (2) = [[2]], (3) = [[[3]]] and so on. But consider (2). That is [[2]], and we saw a moment ago that [2] was <4>, that turns out to be 256.

That is <..<[math]256^{256}[/math]>..> with 255 sets of angle brackets, and already the number is massively bigger than a Googol (a mere [math]10 ^{100}[/math]) so we are going to have to build a “tower of exponents” to even try to write this down. At the next level this is <..<[math]256^{256}^{256}^{256}[/math]>..> and there are still 254 iterations to go. So we end up trying to write a tower of exponents [math]2^{256}[/math] elements high, and even in this form the Universe itself isn’t large enough to contain it, never mind writing the number out longhand. (2) rejoices in the name of mega, not to be confused with the “mega-” prefix we generally use for large units and just meaning “million”. Instead we could begin with a bigger number than 2; (10) is called megiston, “biggest” (although of course you can easily conceive of a bigger one) and you’ll soon find that even getting as far as evaluating [10] leaves you with an unwieldy number, never mind [[[[[[[[[[10]]]]]]]]]]. But we’ll keep megiston in as part of our thought experiment. Okay, so now draw a number line one hundred million miles long, with zero at one end and infinity at the other. Where does megiston belong? —Why, it belongs so close to zero that you can’t position it correctly even with an electron microscope. (And you can’t tell the difference between it and the still larger Graham’s Number, either.)"},{"prompt":"What are your late growth spurt stories?","completion":"This seems to be a very interesting question, the moment I saw this in my feed I clicked the answer later option. Now almost after a time of more than a week I am here seated alone in my room and remembering those beautiful days of my life. Each and every day is different, it teaches us or the other thing. Yes 5 Years is a long time and I am thankful to the almighty and the people around me who made it happen. I love memories as they wont change. I have all of my photographs from last eight years. I would post the first one from 2008 and then we will start from 2012 to 2016. This is me on the very first new year celebration night away from home. The picture itself says a lot, simple, sensible guy with poor dressing sense. Knew nothing about dressing sense, fashion. Was there at my college to pursue my dream. I didn’t even knew how to pose for a click I guess! This was clicked by one of my college friend i our Hostel. Two things from this picture which I love about me is ?? Any guesses ?? Yes my Hair :( and ?? Simplicity. 2012 Life was fun. I was on the top of the world. It was my first year of the post graduation. Used to go for trips, nearby site seeing, exams, college. Husshhhh I miss those days. The life here was so easy. Use to work at college, play, eat and sleep. Unaware of the responsibilities. This phase of life taught me about the importance of friends in our lives. Those are nothing but our extended family. We use to spend our days together. Those kamineys are awesome. This was one of the awesome phase of life. We didn’t had lots of money to spend but we had enough time for each other which we hardly have these days. Adding an extra picture of our group at college. We named it KAMINEY, :P 2013 This was the worst period of my life. I was looking for a job. I used to keep dreaming about a good job. The only thing on my mind was to get placed in one of the best companies as I always dreamt about. This phase taught me to handle life lightly/easily. During this period I got to know about my real friends and friends who are for namesake. My family never asked me about my efforts for getting a job but my distant relatives and family friends didn’t kept any question in their mind. These were the list of questions. What sort of job will you get? What would be the salary? My son works in US, Do you have any scope of going abroad? Get a job ASAP and get married. You are turning bald? Such questions and advises kept coming. I didn’t lost my cool. Enjoyed a lot with my family, had lots of photo shoots, chit chats with my mom. That was the best part along with mom made food which I always craved for when I was at hostel. I always answered them with a smile on my face, because somewhere I knew that its their topic for gossiping. They don’t even care for me. Why should I care about their questions? What this phase of life taught me? Patience. Yes I came back with a bang. 2014 Smiling with confidence Joined in one of the reputed pharma company that too in the department of my choice. Was the happiest man on the earth when I got the confirmation call. This phase too was full of challenges. I got a temporary job here, which was on a contract basis. I worked hard enough to convert the same to a permanent job, that too 6 months before the time. This phase taught me about managing life. I was in Hyderabad with a salary of 10K. I managed in that salary for 6 months and also learned practical skills to properly utilize money. I found it difficult to ask for any extra money from my family. But these awesome people kept showering their blessings along with the financial support whenever I went to see them. Family is always there in our good as well as bad time. 2015 Cool, Composed, Confident. Accomplished my goal, went on travelling to places. Life taught me enough. Enjoyed this phase, Worked hard. Fulfilled my dream of getting a good job. The smile says it all. Bought gifts for all my loved ones. Saw their beautiful faces glowing with happiness. That was the real pleasure. 2016 Shifted the gear, after making all of them happy it was the time to gift myself for the awesome job :P Gifted myself a brand new bike in the last week. Few months before gifted myself with a brand new mobile. My dream mobile. I phone. Awesome time with colleagues. I started reliving my college life. Getting prepared for the upcoming responsibilities now. Started giving time for my hobbies which includes writing. Compared to what I was in 2008, I have enough confidence to grow and life has made me mature enough to deal with most of the things. Thanks for stopping by! Happy Reading!!"},{"prompt":"Could you dig a tank turret or a battleship turret in the ground and the turret sticking out of the top? Wouldn't that be more effective than having an open bunker on top of a hill?","completion":"If you need a quick fix solution, yes. And it has been done before, e.g. during WWI and WW2. An example is the use of the heavy guns (initially naval guns) in coastal batteries. Coastal battery in Belgium (WWI) Nevertheless, from a tactical perspective it is far better to have a purpose-build system (including fire control) and protection than simply copy-paste from another application. That is why this type of solution has always been a quick-fix until better solutions can be found. E.g. taking a turret of a battleship seems a straightforward thing, but many battleship turret systems extend several floors into the ship’s hull (typically to accommodate the reloading equipment/facilities. This is something which is not easily possible in a bunker position, especially if the ground water level is close to the surface.

What are the job prospects?","completion":"Among my work responsibilities, I served as CEO of a large Benture Zcapital Fund and Chair of the Zbosrd and Investment Committee of a 2billion investment fund. CimpSci introduces students to algorithmic thinking, numeracy, programming, ways of thinking and the role of information, all useful in many kinds of professional work. So, it’s a good basis for life, likely to become more important. In my opinion, entreorreneurshio is best learned in practice; CompSci is a good adjunct. International business should be attractive if you ever intend to operate internationally, and CompSci is relatively culture-free and so is portable.

The party has faced a string of defeats in elections. There was a brief interlude in December 2018 — when the party triumphed in three state elections – Rajasthan, Chhatisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. In the 2019 LS elections, the Congress could improve its tally of 2014 by only 8 seats and failed to secure the leader of opposition slot in the Lok Sabha yet again. The end of 2019 was not bad electorally, though it is the allies of the grand old party which actually deserve credit.

When critiquing, you are reading for more than pleasure or to learn something. It goes well beyond pointing out typos and misspellings, although those are important to note. Your goal is to help the author find what’s missing or wrong with their work so they can improve. As you learn to do that, you will find that you are able to read your own work and find many of your own mistakes in the same way. For example, you are reading and following the story. The author suddenly switches to another character’s point of view, and it stopped you cold. The next time you’re reading your own work, you may realize you did the same thing. Because critiquing someone else’s work is a big responsibility, take it seriously. If you’re not sure of a word’s spelling or meaning, look it up. Lots of people write the wrong word when two sound alike but have different meanings. Are there too many run-on sentences, and you felt as if you had to rush to keep up? What made the work easy or difficult to read? Sometimes you won’t know exactly what’s wrong, but you can convey that you got stuck at point A, or had to go back and reread several paragraphs before you could move on, etc. Do critiquing well, and you will develop better skills in grammar, sentence structure, and overall flow or writing as a result. When you focus on detecting mistakes, recognizing that something is missing, or knowing when the pace (or cadence or rhythm) of the story isn’t flowing well, you’ll become a better writer. One part of critiquing, too, is the importance of acknowledging when something is written well, the scene they just described was terrific, or you enjoyed how they made you feel the characters joy or pain through they way they wrote it."},{"prompt":"What are the best freelancing sites?","completion":"Upwork, Fiverr, Freelancer, Toptal, and Guru."},{"prompt":"Do the pheromones plugins really relieve a cat’s stress?

If good people want to have an effect on climate change, we cannot lose competitive advantages to destructive people. To do so would be suicide for good people. If we are to have an effect on climate change, we must begin to understand the behavior of destructive people. And we must change the rules, change the rules to take away advantages from destructive people who use the destruction of our environment to compete against good, productive people, people who have empathy for others, and for their children and grandchildren.

The entire point of a wind turbine is that it generates electricity by capturing some of the energy from the wind, no ‘fuel’ needed. But perhaps you've heard of more specialized applications, where wind turbines are used in remote locations not on the main grid. In those locations, when the wind's not blowing, the turbines aren't generating electricity. And large scale energy storage still isn't very mature, so they can’t just store excess electricity to use later. So, a lot of remote locations will use wind diesel systems. Set up a few wind turbines to generate the bulk of the electricity, and then turn on the diesel generators when the wind's not blowing. Here's an example of one such system: [LINKED_TEXT: Hybrid wind-diesel plant meets Batan Island's total power needsThe Philippines inaugurated its first hybrid wind-diesel power plant in December. The installation, on Batan Island in the country's central Batanes province, comprises three 60 kW turbines from the French small turbine manufacturer Vergnet, and two 500 kW diesel generators. The wind turbines meet the island's total power needs from late afternoon to early morning, when the winds are at their strongest, after which the generators take over. The system is designed so that additional turbines can be added as demand increases. This is the first time Batan has had round the clock power. First Philippine Energy Corp developed the project in collaboration with Advanced Energy Systems of Australia on behalf of state-owned National Power Corps (Napocor), which also operates the plant. Napocor expects to save around PHP 2.5 million (EUR 34,000) a year in fuel costs. Energy Secretary Vincent S Perez said at the inauguration ceremony that the project was \\"a strong showcase of the government's commitment to renewable energy\\" and hoped it would be replicated elsewhere in the Philippines. \\"Amid the rising cost of fossil fuels,\\" he continued, \\"it signals the beginning of our independence from imported oil.\\" Vergnet says there is strong interest from public and private organizations to implement additional wind energy projects.https://www.windpowermonthly.com/article/962025/hybrid-wind-diesel-plant-meets-batan-islands-total-power-needs] [URL: https://www.windpowermonthly.com/article/962025/hybrid-wind-diesel-plant-meets-batan-islands-total-power-needs]Previously, a lot of these communities relied solely on diesel generators. The wind turbines help save them a lot on the cost of electricity by greatly reducing the amount of diesel fuel they need to import – more than enough to be worth the cost of installation. And from a tree hugger perspective, it helps reduce carbon emissions. On larger grids, the shear number of power plants helps make up for the shortfall when the wind's not blowing at any one wind farm. But even then, there are other sources besides wind like hydro, natural gas, and coal that can be ramped up when needed."},{"prompt":"What high protein Indian vegetarian food sources are available for people that go to the gym and want to bulk up while also losing fat?","completion":"If you are vegetarian, hitting the gym and want to build muscle and be healthy and fit, then you should consider adding the following food items in your diet- Peanut ButterGreen gram (Moong Beans)Bengal gram (kala chana/black chana)Health mix (search on Flipkart/Amazon)BananaPomegranateDatesAlmondsCashewsWalnutsOatsPaneerSoya chunks (Read about ideal daily quantity first)Green veggies (overall very important)Sweet PotatoesSeeds (Sunflower/Hemp/Pumpkin)Skimmed milk powder (Amul Sagar would be my recommendation) Some important tips: We are not what we eat but what we digest.

Here are some tips to help you achieve this: Plant in the right location: Pansies prefer full sun to partial shade, and well-drained soil. They can tolerate colder temperatures, so they can be planted in the fall and will bloom until late spring.Provide proper watering: Pansies need consistently moist soil, but be careful not to over-water as this can lead to root rot.Fertilize: Pansies benefit from regular fertilization, use a balanced fertilizer every 4-6 weeks.Deadhead: Deadheading, or removing spent blooms, will encourage the plant to produce more flowers.Provide support: Pansies have a tendency to become top-heavy with blooms, so they may need support to keep them from falling over.Keep them clean: Regularly check the leaves and remove any yellow or diseased leaves, this will help the plant to focus on blooming.Provide adequate spacing: Pansies need space to grow and bloom, so make sure to plant"},{"prompt":"[math]x^2 + y^2 + 1 = z^2[/math]","completion":"Expression evaluates to [math]4xyz[/math] if [math]x=y=z[/math] or [math]xyz = 0.[/math] Considering [math]x,y,z neq 0[/math] , divide the expression by [math]4xyz.[/math] [math]therefore dfrac{(1-y^{2})(1-z^{2})}{2ycdot2z} + dfrac{(1-z^{2})(1-x^{2})}{2zcdot2x} + dfrac{(1-x^{2})(1-y^{2})}{2xcdot2y} = 1.[/math] Substitute [math]x = tan(alpha)[/math] , [math]y = tan(beta)[/math] and [math]z = tan(gamma)[/math], where [math]alpha,beta,gamma[/math] are the angles of a triangle.

How?","completion":"Yes and no. Both techniques have their pros and cons, and for some situations NMR is the better option, for others X-ray crystallography. I’ll break them down into a list so it’s easier to understand. NMR: Pros: In a liquid form; thus mimicking bodily conditions (many use phosphate buffer and a pH of 7 to get as close to body conditions as possible). Or in other words “native” conditions of the macromolecule You can observe multiple conformations, and can even determine what ratio a protein flips between one conformation to another. Non-destructive technique. This same sample can then be used for a variety of other analysis/tests. Dynamic analysis. You can observe allosteric interactions, observe protein-protein interactions, and even folding. Real time experiments. A combination of all the above allows you to observe actual reactions happening in real time at a molecular level. Cons: Size limitation. This is the main drawback for NMR. If your protein is too big, you can’t analyze it via NMR. There are stronger magnets that are coming out, and better labeling schemes coming out that allow you to use NMR on bigger proteins. But most protein complexes are still too big for NMR. Solubility in regards to the concentration required. NMR requires a concentrated sample for decent resolution. Many proteins simply aren’t soluble at those concentrations, or tend to dimerize at those higher concentrations. Either of which is bad for NMR. Price. NMR is incredibly expensive to maintain. Crystallography: Pros No size limit. You want a massive transmembrane protein with 10 domains, go ahead. Resolution is as good as NMR Cons: Solid structure. This is not a good representation of native conditions. Your protein will never be in a solid crystallized structure in your body. Due to the above, you’ll usually only be able to see one conformation. Proteins have multiple conformations, and some of those conformations might be crucial to their interactions/reaction with other proteins or small molecules. You cannot observe this with crystallography. Destructive. Your sample is gone once it’s crystallized. Got the crystal structure? Good, can’t use it for anything else. Difficult. It is very difficult and time consuming to crystallize proteins. While NMR has solubility issues, those are a lot easier resolved than attempting to crystallize a protein. Resolution: If your protein is small enough and solubilizes well at the concentrations required for good resolution data, then NMR is the way to go. If your protein is too big for NMR, then there are other methods (i.e. cryo-EM, SAXS, X-ray Crystallography, even IR). So to answer your question personally: I don’t like the term superior, since that implies one technique is better than the other. Both are valid techniques used for structural analysis, and both provide atomic resolution data."},{"prompt":"Social Science","completion":"Long ago I concluded social science is a jobs program for digits.

Anyone working in the arms industry would be the last to be sent to the frontlines. How else are you going to make your guns? University students are also generally exempt, at least until they’ve completed their studies. This is doubly so for those whose skills are going to be valuable to the war effort, like engineers and doctors. “Intellectuals”, stereotypically professors, are often way too old to be fighting anyway. Nobody in a rifle platoon wants to babysit a 50 year-old scientist who never held a gun before. Even if they are enlisted, somehow, they will always end up in non-combat positions like logistics, engineering, medical corps, propaganda, intelligence, or cryptography (and today, possibly cybersecurity). Their war will be fought in front of a computer and behind a desk even if they were, theoretically, fit enough to serve in the frontlines. The only way they get sent to the front is if they volunteer. Some did, some were comfortable where they were. Forcing any of them to hold a rifle and man the post is a waste of valuable resources. There are so many potential riflemen and very few computer specialists in a country. When the war ends, these people won’t take very long to adjust to the new peacetime economy; their skills can be put to use just as well with different subjects.

Is life easier? What are the advantages you feel you have over others? Are there any disadvantages?","completion":"I couldn’t entirely tell you what my IQ is, but from the various tests I’ve taken, I know I’m at least in the 150+ range. Here it goes, I’ve literally never had to try — not in grade school, not in college. I never felt challenged. Growing up, this was a big disadvantage because the teachers would give the class work, but I’d finish it too quickly and then I’d just pester other people for entertainment. Needless to say, I got in LOTS of trouble at school. As I grew, this never-ending thirst for information lead to me women, conflicts a-plenty, and one whole bunch of fun. Going on to high school though gave me a different battle. I literally ran out of information. I became immensely interested in history and writing. I would watch hours and hours of documentaries, and I would read the hell out of biographies and practically anything I could get my hands on. Typical literature though bored me. If I could use the literature as a means of analyzing the author’s thoughts, I’d enjoy that, but that never really took more than a five minute glance at the book’s contents to figure out… especially with modern writing. Because of this eventual ‘end of information,’ my latter years in high school scared me. I started becoming disconnected from reality. Life felt like it had no substance. The conversations of my peers had no meaning. I often found myself in ‘auto-pilot’ as I went throughout my day. I would go in and out of five to ten minute lapses of consciousness — my stare fixed straight ahead. Despite not experiencing a thing, I still aced my tests, and even the word study never so much as glanced past my vocabulary. I graduated, and I didn’t even attend my ceremony. It seemed like a waste of time because I truly felt that no effort was dispensed. It was like I was incubating. Afterwards, I briefly entered the workforce and then I enrolled in college. While working, I had an EXTREMELY solitary job. There was not a single soul to interact with. I worked in the oilfield, 12 hour night shifts in the middle of nowhere, and I lived in a trailer with one stranger who worked the day shift for 12 hours. We rarely ever spoke to each other, and the vast majority of my job involved waiting. I still contemplate whether or not the job was healthy for me, but it had its quirks. I decided to keep a journal of literally EVERY thought that crossed my mind. There was no phone reception and my only source of electricity was the cigarette lighter in my truck, so the end result lead to me spending probably 11 hours a night just recording my thoughts for three months. I learned about myself, and judged my future, and recorded my successes, compared lives with others, and everything in between. I stared at the huge gas-flare lighting up my surroundings and I pondered all the physics and geography that has to do with oil drilling. I was always fascinated by physics, but my time in the oilfield gave me a fixation with geography as well. Though I still felt disconnected, this was the ‘self’ I took to college. Having new information finally grounded me back to earth. I had to learn a new rhythm. High school was easy, but I knew college only seemed hard — there was a method to the madness. I definitely tried the hardest I ever tried in the first semester of college, and needless to say, I made A’s in everything. Christmas break came around and I felt disconnected again, but then school came rushing back in and everything was okay for a bit. By this time, I was back to my old high school self. I put forward no effort and excelled in classes. That became a problem. Higher education was like a drug. I took my first hit and it sated my thirst for knowledge a bit, but the second time around, its effectiveness plummeted. I needed something else. It was at this time that I started pursuing different, more romantic, goals in life. Up until my fall freshman year in college (age 18) I never bothered getting romantically involved with women. I literally never cared. I found myself more than content watching porn, beating it to help me sleep, and then going about my everyday life. Perhaps it was just a numbers game. My graduating class only had 26 kids, so the dating pool was already small, and in was infinitesimally smaller given that I only found one other woman even remotely date-able, but even she was in a long-term relationship that she wasn’t going to leave for another 3 years after graduating. My dating experience went fast and in a blaze of glory. I probably talked to a total of ten women, kissed five, had sex with three, and then married one — all in the course of only a couple of years from beginning the whole deal. As a relatively smart person, I found dating to be very interesting. It was almost like a puzzle to me… it still is with my wife. To this day, I’ve probably figured out more emotional problems with women than at least a few psychologists. In a way, I guess, I turned to women as my new source of information. I got to know them, played around in bed with them, learned their bodies, learned their minds, and then I connected it all together. It was the first time in which I really experienced my emotional self, and up until this point, I don’t think I’d ever tapped into it before. Even to the most strong willed person I meet, I’ll still tell them to this day — you never know what you’ll do when you’re in love. I found myself doing some incredibly stupid shit, and I can guarantee that you will too. Don’t ever doubt it. My college work after I started dating became far more efficient too. It was a mixture of me having absolutely no money and not seeing it as a necessity, but I started taking my classes without even buying the books. I depended entirely on the lectures, and then took the tests. At first I kept a few notebooks and wrote down key topics, but after a few months, even that stopped. I remember one girl I was involved with at the time, Maegan. Maegan and I took an upper level history class together with a professor who graduated from Yale, wrote well over ten books, and gave the BEST lectures ever. I would stroll into her classroom with a paper plate with two pepperoni pizzas on it that I got for free from whatever seminar happened on the campus that day, and I would just listen to the professor as if she was an episode of Scooby-Doo or some other cartoon. From onlookers, I paid a child-like attention. Before she met me, Maegan thought for sure that I was bombing the hell out of that class. After our first few conversations, Dr. Hinton’s class came up, and she suddenly recognized me. I was ‘that guy who didn’t pay attention and just sat there rudely eating pizza while I [Maegan] was diligently taking notes.’ For one, I didn’t even remember what the hell time she was talking about because my days more or less ran together by this point, and for two, I really thought nothing of it. This was the first time someone gave me a true ‘outside the window, looking-in’ view of how I acted in the classroom and how particular it was. She asked how I could ever do that. Flabbergasted, she said ‘but she has so much information in her lectures! Do you just remember all of that?’ Flabbergasted as she was, not much compared to her reaction after I told her that I don’t even use, or buy, the books. For the most part, college stayed this way, but every now and then, I had a bone to pick with the professors. I’ve always been real keen on a bullshitter when I see one. If someone’s just stringing me along, I’m quick to realize it, and I have two steps to that — the same two steps I have with my entire life. Fool me once, and it’s on you to fix the problem. Fool me twice, and I’ll fix the problem, and neither you or I will probably like the outcome. I’ve always stood up to people who messed with either me or the few close friends I had, and as an educator (which was what I went to college for), I got real fuckin’ pissed if a teacher created a system in which it graded kids on an uneven scale. It almost sounds hilarious, but I ended up taking a ‘Literary Fairy Tales’ class over the summer. The class sounded like a good place to meet girls, and in fact, I knew for sure of a girl that interested me who was in that class. I soon found out though that the Disney character of a professor that I was expecting to see was an awful person who was hell bent on convincing all her students that all fairy tales were secret feminist cries for help, and if you didn’t think that way it meant your grade. Oh, and did I mention that if you missed ONE day of class, you dropped an ENTIRE LETTER GRADE??? Classes are supposed to gauge the amount of information one knows about the topic. If I write a proper paper that has its facts and reasoning all in a pretty little line and you can’t find any faults in it, that’s called an A. If I already know your bullshit spiel and and I ace your papers, don’t be magically offended when I’m not motivated enough to hear you blow your regurgitated story out of your ass on yet another ‘literary fairy tale.’ I called her out in class twenty-four seven. I challenged her logic, and I left her without a comeback everytime, and she kept lowering my grades on my papers again and again. I finally had enough of it and I told her off for good. I told her that she was more concerned with teaching her students what to think instead of presenting them with the facts and actually allowing them to think, and not only did she not do this, but that she reinforced it by having a ridiculous borderline-Nazi styled attendance policy that was only compounded by the fact that she docked off points for not thinking like her. I told her that ultimately we, as the students, were responsible for her paycheck and that she’d better have some damned respect for her pupils if she ever wants to have any degree of success with less-than-brainwashed kids. This bitch actually tried laughing this off. She denied the fact that the students are responsible for her paycheck via tuition. I looked at her and said “how about you go teach your fairy tales to the four walls of an empty room and see how much you get paid. Oh, and by the way, I’m going to be a teacher, and I’m going to make damn sure that the next thousand kids I come in contact with know how shitty of a human being you are” She started threatening me and telling me to leave the classroom, so I did. I was finished with what I had to say anyhow. I later learned that despite all the tough talk she gave me, she immediately ran to the dean in a tattle-tale-like fashion just so she could get her story in first to save her job. She knew she was in the wrong and she still has her job, but man it feels fuckin’ amazing to know you’re in the right and put that stain on their memories like that. Sometimes I feel like teachers like that don’t get the cue that some kids know exactly what they’re doing. I’ve even done that to a lot of bosses, which brings me to my employment. Getting a job and keeping a job has always been hard for me. I get bored far too quickly, and though I’ve written a practical essay at this point and I could go on much further, I wind this down to an end. tl;dr Advantages, In the realm of information processing, you don’t have to try. School is easy. You get to understand much more than the average person due to the ability to critically think. Disadvantages, Because school is so easy, you tend to have a pretty shitty work ethic (if it’s not challenging, you drop it quickly) Because you understand much more than the average person, living in the world can be very frustrating, especially since few people are capable of bouncing back your ideas which can sometimes be necessary for you to vent frustrations.

Recent years, due to the increasing trend towards Natural Botany Solutions, Western societies have only been made aware of its impressive medicinal benefits. The anti-hyperglycemic potential of Berberine has been confirmed by multiple human studies. This highlights the ability of Berberine to support blood sugar and cholesterol levels. The growing numbers of research papers published in various prestigious journals, including the Journal of Metabolism , evaluated and confirmed the anti-diabetic potential of Berberine. (To read the full studies, follow the links at the bottom of this page.) 5 Specific Ways Berberine Can Stabilize Your Blood Sugar Berberine has been prized for centuries for its healing properties. Now this potent herb is naturally balancing blood sugar levels by helping your body: Decrease insulin resistance, making the blood sugar lowering hormone ‘insulin’ more effective Berberine may activate the ‘metabolic master switch’: An energy-stabilizing enzyme found inside cells, AMPK (adenosine monophosphate kinase), is known as a ‘metabolic master switch’ due to its positive influence on metabolism.[*] It’s believed that this helps improve insulin sensitivity at the cellular level. Decrease sugar production in the liver Berberine helps slow the sugar factory: According to studies, berberine may stimulate glycolysis, the metabolic pathway by which sugar is broken down and converted to energy, and may inhibit gluconeogenesis, the creation of glucose.[*] In effect, these activities decrease insulin sensitivity and help to balance blood sugar levels. Slow the breakdown of carbohydrates Berberine supports the liver: Plant compounds are thought to help improve insulin sensitivity in the liver by reducing its production of glucose. Additionally, berberine is thought to boost thermogenesis. These activities help suppress the liver’s tendency to make new glucose when liver cells become insulin resistant. Increases the number of beneficial bacteria in the gut. ¹ Several studies have shown that berberine may modulate the gut microbiota through enriching short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria and reducing microbial diversity. This in turn inhibits dietary polysaccharide degradation and decreases caloric intake in the gut, which may improve energy metabolism and intestinal health; anti-inflammatory effects; and immune regulatory effects. Removes deep body fat that accumulates around the belly and organs There’s a strong correlation between blood sugar and weight loss. Research on berberine for weight loss and fat-burning activity is limited but promising. In one 12-week study, subjects lost about 2.3% body weight — or 5 pounds — and lowered BMI and body fat percentage by 3.6% with a dosage of 3,500 mg per day.[*] Another 3-month study revealed a drop in BMI, from 31.5 to 27.4, in obese indivhttps://www.digistore24.com/redir/352613/ghuffran/] [URL: https://www.digistore24.com/redir/352613/ghuffran/]"},{"prompt":"ve you left California and if so, why?","completion":"For 5 years to New Mexico.

The concept Black Hole is derived from that same total lack of knowledge of the GTE.

Lots of people will want to make this about “not if you have good technique,” but technique is only a small piece of it, and rest is important for all voices. Put another way: if you were running a marathon every day of your life, would that be bad for you? Sure, if you had bad running technique you’d be even more prone to injury, but even if with perfect technique, 26 miles takes a huge strain on your body. There’s an amount of running, say a few miles a day, that’s not just not-bad, but actively good for you, but there’s also a limit. The same is true for speaking, but there are many professions for which that limit is not observed in the lifestyle. If you’re talking all day long, you will probably develop injuries at some point. This is part of why school teachers famously develop vocal trauma: they have no choice but to speak all day (and sometimes yell), which is very, very hard on the voice regardless of technique."},{"prompt":"What are some short stories about wives?","completion":"“ Arjun, please tell your mother not to make changes to anything in the house!

This upset Seema even more, and she rushed into the bedroom, like a train whizzing past a station without stopping. Arjun knew he was in trouble, so he delayed going to the bedroom, instead hanging out in the hall until the time he thought she would cool down. Just as he was about to start working on something, his mother stormed into the house,” You wife is so cruel!

She changed all of those to their original position, and started banging things while she was doing those, how insensitive!” saying that, his mother chugged on into her room. Now Arjun was angry at Seema, so he rushed to his bedroom and saw Seema crying, face down on the bed. “You know, you shouldn’t have undone what mom had taken pains to correct” he said. Seema looked up momentarily, in disgust, and said “You’ll never understand, isn’t it? It’s always the wife’s fault.” and returned back to crying on the bed. Arjun tried to reason what Seema had just said, and reflected on his mother’s words. All the things his mother talked about, the vase, the TV, the chair, were placed by him, and he had told once to Seema that he liked the chair in that position, he liked the TV in that awkward position, even though Seems tried to correct it, and he had placed the vase in the vulnerable position, because he just liked it there.

But if repairs are not your forte’, or you absolutely hate that kind of work, I’d suggest you hire the man. While you save money by doing it yourself, you save time and sanity by having a contractor do it. And if you develop a good relationship with a certain contractor, you can often work out discounts.

And finally the terrorists were able to get into Hotel Taj Palace and Nariman House making people hostage having access to Television and Indian news channels. Now comes the real hero of our country, the Indian media.. You thought I would say Indian Police, Indian Army or our Commandos. No chance… You just see our real heroes here, “Indian Media Houses”. So let's see what our super hero did here.. . They were showing live that Indian commandos have landed on the roof of Nariman House. And don't forget Terrorists were having access to these footages directly or indirectly through their people outside. . Then they were showing live the footages outside the Hotel Taj Palace. Sadly terrorists were having direct access to these footages as well. . They kept on showing the position of army and police officers live on TV everytime. This heroic feat of Indian media went on and on until all the terrorists were killed and 166 innocents died in one of the biggest terrorist attack of all time. Still the most heroic award goes to Indian Media. Huge round of applause. 👏👏 Now you know both, our media is not biased and they are smart as well.

However there are some things that are easier from the command line. Commands can be useful and in some circumstances they can more easily perform some tasks. One area where commands really shine is if you want to do several tasks without needing to perform each one in the GUI. You can set up a bat file to automate backups that need several steps to complete. And with powershell you can do a lot of interesting things that are difficult or impossible in the GUI. As an example of the above, I have a bat file that uses a powershell command to list all the installed programs I have, and then runs a command to gather my data files together and back them up to a zip file. This way I don’t have to worry about the parameters for the zip command and can launch the backup and then go on to other things."},{"prompt":"w do I get rid of lower back pain?","completion":"The best solution for back pain depends on the underlying cause and severity of the pain.

Among them, coir based mattresses are fabricated using the fibers from outer husk of a coconut. Due to their organic nature, they are very well suited for the people who are allergic to synthetic substances. The greatest advantage of such mattresses is that they are very well ventilated and thus provide enhanced hygroscopic properties, i.e., they impart great air circulation and moisture absorption characteristics. Spring mattresses make use of either one of the [LINKED_TEXT: bonnell, offset, pocket-spring and continuous coils] [URL: https://shoppinaire.quora.com/The-extensive-guide-to-purchasing-a-new-Mattress] as the core/support material on top of which a comfort layer is attached. it is meant to provide adequate comfort and cushioning to the user’s body. When lying/sitting on a spring mattress, the body does not get sunken into the mattress like in case of foam mattress, but stays above it. This facilitates easier turning movements during sleep. On the other hand, foam based mattress makes use of either PU or Memory foam as the core/support layer, on top of which the comfort layer is built. Among the two, Memory foam provides better all-round comfort to the body as compared to a PU foam and is well suited for people who suffer from neck/spine issues or others who prefer body hugging comfort. In fact, due to their therapeutic properties, memory foam mattresses are commonly known by their secondary name - Orthopedic Mattresses. While, mattresses built with PU foam provide better temperature regulation and the user sleeps cooler than in case of memory foam mattress. They also tend to be marginally more ‘bouncy’ than their memory foam counterparts. So, those who prefer less sunken sitting/lying experience would find PU foam mattresses a great choice. A great advantage of PU foam mattresses is that they are relatively light in weight as compared to the other two configurations. In addition to the insights shared above, factors such as the dimensions of the mattress one should opt for relative to the dimensions of the bed, and awareness about the ways by which some brands resort to cutting production costs by using low-grade materials in the fabrication of the mattresses, that cause several neck and spine issues, too play crucial roles in determining the product one should opt for. I gained in-depth knowledge about them from the post - [LINKED_TEXT: Vibhor Shergill's answer to The extensive guide to purchasing a new Mattress.] [URL: https://shoppinaire.quora.com/The-extensive-guide-to-purchasing-a-new-Mattress] So, today, i.e., 1st November, 2021, at 2:57 PM, I placed the order for my mattress, keeping the insights gained in consideration.

The place was Orpington, a fairly nondescript suburb on the edge of South East London, which just happens to be where I grew up. The restaurant was McDonalds, newly opened as a chain in the UK, and certainly not what we had been used to on the British High Street. The customer was Elsie. Now, no-one really knew how old Elsie was. At the time, she was probably in her 70s, but she might have been in 60s or 80s. Elsie had the bad luck to be born, with a cleft palatte, in an era where the country’s response to such children was to separate them from “normal people.” By time the events of this answer took place, she was well-established in what would now be called a “care home” in a village in rural area a few miles outside of Orpington. It was clear that she’d never had any formal education, at least she couldn’t read or write, and not obviously do any maths. In fact, she couldn’t really string much of a sentence together. Mostly three or four words was her limit. She did, however, have a strong sense of what she wanted, and the kind of willpower you could break rocks on. She managed to regularly get people to drive her into Orpington. I’m not just talking about care home workers, but people from local churches, teenagers from the village who’d got their first cars… you name it, people knew her, and did what she asked. In the case of McDonalds, her entire order was “cup of tea.” The first times this happened, there was a bit of confusion. Attempts were made to explain that McDonalds, despite expanding into England, didn’t serve cups of tea. Her reply was the phrase “cup of tea.” Further attempts were made to advise her that this wasn’t on the menu. “Cup of tea”, was her considered response. Finally, one of the staff worked out what was needed. (S)he (local legend didn’t relate the gender of the person in question) went up to the staff room, got some cash, walked out of McDonalds, into a local Pizza restaurant, bought a cup of tea, and brought it back to McDonalds for Elsie. Elsie now had proof that her strategy worked. For the next five years, she was a regular in Orpington McDonalds, accustomed to getting her cup of tea. After the first couple of months, the service speed increased, since whoever was on the tills would inevitably recognise her before she made her way to the counter, and someone would be en route to the restaurant a few doors down the high street to make the purchase. As far as I know, McDonalds officially never knew of this. It just became the norm for the minimum-wage staff to go and buy this elderly lady her unvarying beverage of choice."},{"prompt":"here been an increase in UFO activity since the Voyager satellite left our solar system?","completion":"In addition to [LINKED_TEXT: Viktor T.

Only two were manufactured, with one of those now on display at the Gateway Auto Museum. Purchased for 3.24 million, the two-seat roadster with a fiberglass body is the collection’s crown jewel and possibly the world’s rarest automobile. BMC Mini Proof that necessity is the mother of invention, the Mini was created by the British Motor Company in a period of drastic gas rationing in Great Britain in the late ’50s and early ’60s. Despite being just 10 feet long to achieve better gas mileage, the earliest Mini comfortably sat four people thanks to an engine that was mounted transversely, instead of front to back, allowing for more interior room. Since then, the Mini has been the inspiration behind later generations of small and smart cars. Ford Mustang In the first six months of production in 1964, the Mustang was the fastest-selling car in history. It has since become an icon of style and performance among American automobiles, escorting in the “pony car” class of affordable sporty coupes with long hoods and short rear decks. Competitors raced to release their own versions, such as the Chevy Camaro, the Pontiac Firebird, and the Dodge Challenger. In 1964 alone, the Mustang was the pace car for the Indianapolis 500 and won both first and second in class at the Tour de France international rally.

Money Pairs In forex exchanging, monetary forms are recorded two by two, like USD/CAD, EUR/USD, or USD/JPY. These address the U.S. dollar (USD) versus the Canadian dollar (CAD), the euro (EUR) versus the USD, and the USD versus the Japanese yen (JPY). There will likewise be a cost related with each pair, for example, 1.2569. Assuming this is the USD/CAD pair, it implies that it costs 1.2569 CAD to get one USD. On the off chance that the cost increments to 1.3336, it currently costs 1.3336 CAD to get one USD. The USD has expanded in esteem against the CAD, so it presently costs more CAD to get one USD.

Numerous speculation organizations permit people to open records and exchange monetary forms through their foundation. This isn't similar to an excursion to an unfamiliar trade booth. The cycle is altogether electronic with no actual trade of cash starting with one hand then onto the next. Rather, dealers are taking a situation in a particular money with the expectation that there will be some vertical development and strength in the cash that they're purchasing (or shortcoming in the event that they're selling) so they can create a gain. Forex Market versus Different Markets There are a few crucial contrasts between unfamiliar trade and different business sectors. There, first of all, are less guidelines, and that implies financial backers aren't held to severe principles or guidelines like those in the stock, fates, and choices markets. There are no clearing houses and no focal bodies that direct the forex market. Second, since exchanges don't occur on a conventional trade, there are less charges or commissions like those on different business sectors. Then, there's no end with regards to when you can and can't exchange. Since the market is open 24 hours every day, you can exchange whenever.

Not terribly long after their civil war came the Glorious Revolution and the right of all Englishmen to be armed “suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by law.” The modifiers, of course, were stretched to the point that in April 1775 the military governor of Massachusetts, Thomas Gage, felt perfectly justified in ordering the confiscation of guns, ball and powder from the local citizenry. This was resisted in the Battles of Concord and Lexington, the first military actions of the Revolutionary War. In some states, there’s a Patriots’ Day holiday, and the Boston Marathon is run then. That’s how important the tradition is: Without the right to bear arms, we’d still be British colonies along the east coast, and the remainder of the US is anybody’s guess."},{"prompt":"What are some of the shrewdest, smartest military maneuvers ever seen?Was it a significant point in history?","completion":"My personal favorite is George Washington’s movement into the British rear at Princeton — the old leave the camp-fires burning trick, 2 Jan 1777 “ The main army of Americans, about five thousand strong, were encamped on the south side of the Assanpink Creek at Trenton, when, toward evening on the 2nd of January (1777), Cornwallis approached from Princeton with a superior force of British regulars. They had engaged in a series of skirmishes on the way, and followed the Americans, who had attacked them, to the margin of the Assanpink. After trying to pass the guarded fords of that stream, they halted and lighted fires; and Cornwallis rested that night with the full assurance that he would make an easy conquest of the republican army the next day. \\"I will catch the fox in the morning,\\" he said the Earl to Sir William Erskine, who urged him to make an attack that night. Washington's army were now in a very critical situation. A council of war was held, when it was decided to withdraw stealthily, at midnight, take a circuitous route to Princeton, gain the rear of the British and beat up their quarters there, and then fall upon their stores at New Brunswick. But the ground, on account of a thaw, was too soft to allow an easy transit for their forty pieces of cannon. This gave Washington much anxiety. While the council was in session, the wind turned to the northwest, the temperature suddenly fell, and by midnight the ground was frozen as hard as a pavement. Along the front of the American camp, fires had been lighted, and the British supposed the republicans were slumbering. Great was their surprise, multiplication and alarm, when, at dawn, they discovered that the American camp-fires were still burning but the army had departed, none knew whither. All was silent and dreary on the south side of the Assanpink, when suddenly there came upon the keen wintry air, from the direction of Princeton, the low booming of cannon. Although it was a cold winter's morning, Cornwallis thought the sound was the rumbling of distant thunder. The quicker of all, Erskine, decided that it was the noise of artillery, and exclaimed: \\"To arms, general! Washington has outgeneralled us. Let us fly to the rescue at Princeton!\\" [LINKED_TEXT: George Washington - Battle of Trenton] [URL: http://www.publicbookshelf.com/public_html/Our_Country_vol_2/georgewas_je.html] [LINKED_TEXT: Battle of Princeton] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Princeton] In the modern era, this is akin to the WW2 Western Allies ‘creating’ through false signal traffic and dummy vehicles and camps, a large, army fake army opposite the Pas d’ Calais .This fake formation so captivated German attention (Hitler’s) that the high command refused to release reserves to Normandy that might have held the allies on the Cotentan peninsula. By the time the Germans changed their mind, it was too late. I also like Hannibal’s trick at lake Trasimene. Here, he noticed that a dense early morning fog rose from the lake. He army was camped at the end of a defile bordered by a wooded hill on one side and the lake on the other. Leaving hiss camp-fires burning, he left a small part of his force visibly guarding the camp (as if the main force had left), but moved the bulk of his army up the hill opposite the lake. As planned, his forces were hidden by the thick morning mist. The Romans took the bait. Hannibal caught their army in march formation as they approached his camp. they charged down as soon as the mist cleared.

The EU say Novavax is dragging it’s heels. Novavax say they are wary, following the AZ vaccine program. Who is telling the truth?","completion":"I have replied to a Similar question before but now to try and put it from the view of a vaccine supplier : Supply contracts are complicated to negotiate and rely on good faith on both sides. If we take the Oxford/ AstraZeneca interaction between the U.K. and the EU. They were negotiated under different legal systems. The U.K. can work under a memorandum of understanding which declares an intent on a future transaction snd often happens in large contracts to allow the work to continue ahead of a formal sign off which is at the end of negotiations. Apparently the Belgium law that the EU used in its contract does not recognise this method of working. In the U.K. the government facilitated the development of plant by increasing capacity and paying upfront for the factory upgrade and some vaccine doses, the firms subcontracted by AstraZeneca to fulfil the contract failed to meet the agreed delivery request, but as the vaccine also experienced delays there was no come back by the U.K. government. The teething troubles in setting up the plants were resolved and when the U.K. did finally approve the vaccine for use while pushing for greater qualities , as one might expect in a pandemic the variability of batches was accepted as something that happened, an annoyance, but something that could be worked on in partnership. In the case of the EU they negotiated on the ‘at cost ‘ price to get a better deal, they expected production to be carried out in the EU, but allowed the U.K. plant to be included as authorised facilities; they paid on signing of the contract which payment went into building/ enhancing existing EU facilities that AstraZeneca subcontracted to carry out the work. They expected first class service while paying super economy pricing and a full servicing of their demands. After the contract was signed, and before the EU had approved the vaccine AstraZeneca informed them that the plants were not producing the expected yields and they would be unable to meet the first quarters expected deluvery quantity. Rather than trying to resolve the issue or to go to law the EU commission escalated to include a third party country was was distributing vaccine to its population as it had approved the vaccine some weeks previously. They demanded that this other country reduce its production of vaccine by diverting supplies to the EU, who at this time had still not approved the vaccine so could not have used it with their member states. Contract details that are normally confidential were published with parts redacted , which was easily circumvented and placed on the internet. While the EMA supported the decision to approve the vaccine, individual states decided to persue their own path at this point and applied their own restrictions , and there followed a campaign of sending the companies integrity and reputation, the EU even instigated dawn raids , the factory in Belgium was raised and no action was taken, rather fill and finish plant in Italy was raided and 250,000 doses destined for Australia which under new regulation the EU had just implemented was not a sanctioned export. So Australia was denied their supply by the EU. A few days ago the same plant was raided again, and some 30 million doses , or equivalent were found. For those who are unfamiliar with the term fill and finish it refers to the plant that takes the bulk vaccine batch, and transferred it rmto the vials for distribution and then labels and packages the vials for distribution to its intended destination. A production batch can be 1–2 million doses. U.K. the midst of a pandemic this plant would be working to capacity so a large amount of vaccine is to be expected. The initial rumour was that this was an undeclared stock heading towards the U.K. investigations showed that 16 million doses were destined for Belgium and the rest was a shipment destined for developing nations under the COVAX agreement. Both deliveries were allowed under the new EU regulations. Those in the EU will provide a different story of irregular deliveries and less than promised number of doses. The Politicians in the EU member states have politicised the vaccine to their own ends and stoked the already significant anti vaccine movement in the EU. And they have painted AstraZeneca as the villain of the piece. the EU has probably learned from its mistakes and will have updated their contract to avoid the issues they have experienced with the AstraZeneca contract, so the trend from the EU’s point of view will be one that will favour them at every point. From the Point of view of Novavax, they are dealing with a bloc of countries that at some points negotiate as a unit and at others each country will break away putting their own interests first. The contract will probably lock down delivery volumes and dates while offering novavax the ‘privilege’ of taking all the risk and carry the full burden of the costs if anything goes awry They have a good order book with countries that just want to be vaccinated. They will have to weigh up the options provided in the contract agains the risks they are going to take. They are aware of the treatment meted out to AstraZeneca, whether deserved or not. They have to decide if the profit is worth the potential pain the EU could inflict on them. They are probably weighting up their options and negotiating with their lawyer paying particular care to each clause in the contract. if they wish the U.K. has already offered to build managed plant for them, before their vaccine has even been agreed. In the U.K. they will be close to high quality research centres and there a major centre of genomic sequencing so they can gain from early access to new variants if they wanted the information. these are my readings of the situation, they could of course be wide of the mark.

Hakeem was the most dominate big man coming out of college at the time. Houston made the right choice in picking Hakeem.

It made sense because they just drafted another guy that played in Jordan’s position in Clyde Drexler, Hakeem’s college teammate in the Phi Slama Jama Houston team. Also Bowie had so much potential coming out of college as a big man. Michael was a tramendous basketball player coming out, however nobody knew he would be the player that he would become because Dean Smith limited his play style while at North Carolina.

Things you should be aware of while hiring a mover For an expert packer and mover, the staff’s attitude and their job ethics decide the overall performance and infrastructure. If the shifting service provider fails to attract you with its attitude of expertise, you can determine that the packer is not the apt one to select for your moving requirement.When looking for reliable packers and movers, it is important to ensure the registration details and their license documents. This act confirms that the moving service provider has a trustable team of good resources to provide all the needed help for home shifting services.Always it is not true, but in most cases, a reliable shifting company will have its place for official duties rather than hiring a rented place. Also, if it is a rented office area, that does not mean it is a fake mover and packer. However, owning an office space almost confirms the moving company would be genuine.Before selecting any packer and mover, it is necessary to read reviews from the reliable sources of those relocation companies like doing market research and verifying neutral websites. Get references from your friends or relatives who have already experienced the services of those companies.When you are looking for shifting companies, it is apparent that we would look for the top moving company.

Everything else is stealing."},{"prompt":"Social Science","completion":"Politics and economics are sometimes called ‘social science’ or ‘political science’ by higher education institutions even, but as Cambridge economist and adviser to The World Bank Ha-Joon Chang evinces, the rules of these are arbitrary value-judgements, mostly based on precedent. For example, the value of screen digits (that can be deleted) or bills (that can be burned) does not exist objectively in the way oxygen or the recurrent presence of the occipital lobe at the back of the average living skull, do. Politics as political science and economics as a social science are mostly not real science because what Thomas Kuhn called the “theoretical assumptions” are too changeable by culture to be considered objective enough for science. Rights and capitalism were made-up (during the 1700s) and caught on; they were not discovered like ordinary science but made up and (often implicitly) agreed upon. But then there are some very generalisable theories like Game Theory that come closer to more objectivity (the ideal of science), because they can be applied again and again. Considering the subject and observer relationship in anthropology is very interesting. The reason for a community that does Rain Dance is to the dancers their belief it could well bring rain - it is a false belief that is the explanation of the cause: that their moves could affect precipitation. The real cause, in anthropology called the functionalist explanation, is that the rain dance provides social cohesion in times of drought and distress. But ‘social cohesion’ is again not very objective because it does not explain why, in a comprehensive enough way, there is a need for social cohesion that plays out in that way, when it could play out another way, say by leaving for wetter land. Nor does it explain who came up with rain dancing, and why? But because it is the best explanation available it earns the social science title. The danger is that people trust in the generalising of social sciences as much as natural sciences just because they share ‘science’ in their titles. Mix X of hydrochloric acid with Y sodium chloride you will get Z sodium chloride and water. Mix X a female observer with Y a male in different coloured shirts you will get Z a very vague, changeable and insignificant enough data-set for ranking responses, making sense of them then applying the relations of colour and apparent biological sex to the rest of the populations. More of X (female) and more of Y (males in different shirts) and more recorded responses can increase probability of a very generalisable conclusion for how females respond to males in different shirt colours, but never totally. You can dress it up in percentages made up of recording many responses from say, “from 1–10 how do you like this colour on this male, 0 being awful, 10 stunning?”, but to those unversed in the different sciences, this can be misleading ‘dressing up’ of the qualitative as quantitative substance. “80% of females prefer green on a male”: 80% how? Which females and males? What criteria? What colour hue? Creating valid meta-analyses for that is implausible, perhaps impossible. Social sciences can not predict as much natural but does have some predictive principles (rather than laws) like Pavlov effect or the acquisition of language. In more material neuroscience there is Hebb's law. In the real world there is too much interference and variability going on per the Duhem-Quine problem. And social science more than other science suffers from ethical limits. In the prior shirt example the answers depend too much on the subjectivity of the male and the female - to ever make it a law, or even a substantially corroborated theory e.g. “green is preferred on males compared to beige”. Intuitively that clain is probably correct for the majority (green occurs more than beige and that is inferably for a reason), but it is unsubstantiated therefore failed science. The method resembles science, but there is no over-arching explanation that would make it rigorous science. It does not answer this is the nature of judgements of colour and opposite sex wearer; but that this is maybe the relationship of this for an extrapolated majority. As philosopher of science Carl Hempel argued science is essentially arguments with premises and conclusions, with ultimate laws and particular facts. For example, a hypothetical plant dies: “Because there are no windows in its room this plant has not get enough sunlight. Without enough sunlight a plant cannot create carbohydrates through photosynthesis, so will eventually die. Hence the plant died.” In this case two true laws and a particular fact are present. The law 1. that the plant needs light to photosynthesise and 2. the plant need photosynthesis to survive and the particular fact 3. that the plant was not exposed to sunlight. The most trusted - because reliable and consistent - science is of this kind. A lot of what passes for science in social science is not of this kind, therefore, is less trustworthy science than the physical but is the the best we have going for us. Social sciences has a difficult job to because of the limits and lack of generalising in ‘human nature'. But what alternative to probabilistic behavioural science is there? None that I know, and better to generalise and have probable (a spectrum of often mistaken to sometimes mistaken) knowledge than none, or the worse state-of-affairs that is complete pseudoscience. I have written relevant pieces like The Need For Bias and Why Economic Theory Hurts Us that explain further.

But, I believe an honest man is not at all affected by Demonetisation, GST and RERA. I have stopped believing on false, unfolded and fabricated news syndicated by paid media especially those by NDTV, Firstpost and Huffpost and Bloomberg Quint. These reforms are necessary so that our next generation will see less of corruption, financial frauds and tax stashing. I have personally worked in BFSI industry extensively in past with banking giants in Mumbai and today I work as independent financial consultant. All my friends who still work as product managers in major banks have told me the demand for savings account and credit cards have increased drastically. Post Demonetisation there was flood of housewives outside banks for opening their very first savings account. Construction tycoons have agreed to offer you homes in 100% white money. They are now afraid of the words like ‘black payment’ or ‘down payment’. Traders have actually welcomed GST. Stock brokers are happier than ever. Media will never report this. I Google searches are taken as indicator than only 1,200 people searched for word ‘saving account’ per month before Demonetisation.

What is expected from Government and what should people do on their part?","completion":"Chennai is currently facing water crisis, what are the short term and long solutions? What is expected from Government and what should people do on their part? Thanks for A2A Bring regulations to get approval for building new constructions. Because it is a known fact that most part of Chennai sits on waterbodies. And most new buildings are built by destroying the water bodies that are otherwise a catchment area for rainwater.Bringing regulations is the easy part of it. The toughest part is implementing the regulations from the government. This is a careful top-down approach that can work well if properly implemented. But I highly doubt any of these happening because the building industry and the cartels around it are the darker sides of this business that the public might not be aware of. It is tough to bring them under any kind of regulations. Even the public who bought the houses won’t really care about the ethics of living in a building built on a waterbody. #FLOP #FAIL Chennai alone is not facing this crisis. The rest of Tamil Nadu is equally water scarce. It is just that the population density of the Chennai city is making the water problem worse. For another question similar to this, I have answered how the entire Tamil Nadu is slowly becoming a desert. [LINKED_TEXT: Umesh Ramamoorthi's answer to Where do you see Tamil Nadu in the next 5 years?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/Where-do-you-see-Tamil-Nadu-in-the-next-5-years/answer/Umesh-Ramamoorthi-1] [LINKED_TEXT: Umesh Ramamoorthi's answer to What will happen to Chennai (India) next with the current water crisis?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/What-will-happen-to-Chennai-India-next-with-the-current-water-crisis/answer/Umesh-Ramamoorthi-1] Depopulation of Chennai: There are so many organizations and corporations in Chennai. And the city is getting crowded year by year. Because of a lack of investment in the rest of the cities and rural areas of Tamil Nadu, people flock Chennai from their native places for work. Hence, it is important to depopulate Chennai to ease its burden by bringing jobs in the other parts of Tamil Nadu. There is also a huge population of North Indians in Chennai who recently migrated to doing unskilled jobs. They would also migrate and spread instead of concentrating on a single location if a sustainable infrastructure is developed in the rural areas of Tamil Nadu. Take care of the existing water bodies at least: There are many lakes and ponds in Chennai that are in an improper shape. The public and the government can take care of it so that they have a catchment area prepared for the next rain. There need not be much explanation required for this, as many in Chennai are already working towards it. But the question is, whether that would be enough to feed water to the existing population? Or in Inspite of maintaining them, do Chennai have to steal water from nearby villages and districts?Urban Sewage and rainwater management: Many in started to become aware of using water properly after the crisis. Still, it is not enough. There is a lot of things to be done. Right now the greywater from houses and the rainwater are channeled to flow together underground. Instead, we have to build a proper rainwater management system in the city to harvest it. And also the sewage water must have to be managed better. If possible, recycled. Rainwater Collection: All the above-mentioned points are a top-down approach where the help of the municipality and the local government is essential. Individuals living in Chennai can also take measures at their homes to save enough rainwater. This is a bottom-up approach. There is already enough awareness among the people about the importance of rainwater. It is just that people are really lazy to build another tank and facilitate catching rainwater in it. When they get over it, they can catch rainwater. (Just a picture I found on google. I am not endorsing any party here. :P ) Greywater Treatment at houses: There are many technologies available to treat the greywater that houses let out. These technologies with membranes in it can help us regenerate 40 to 60% of the greywater to be used again. Using proper nozzles: At a microscopic level, if one wants to reduce the water usage of their homes, then one can go for the water-saving nozzles to be fitted in their pipes."},{"prompt":"Why is there so little trash on the streets of Vancouver, British Columbia, relative to any other city, such as San Francisco?","completion":"Just a guess, a good bit more pride of their surroundings.

While some bloggers may generate substantial income from their blogs, others may struggle to make any significant revenue. However, let's dive into some of the common ways bloggers can potentially earn money: 1️⃣ Advertising: Many bloggers opt for advertising as one of their primary sources of income. They can display banner ads or use pay-per-click (PPC) advertisements such as Google AdSense. The revenue is generated based on the number of clicks or impressions these ads receive. 2️⃣ Affiliate Marketing: Bloggers can promote products or services through affiliate marketing programs and earn a percentage commission on each sale that comes from their referral link. This requires building trust with your audience and promoting relevant products that align with your blog's niche. 3️⃣ Sponsored Content: Bloggers may collaborate with brands or companies to create sponsored content where they feature or review products in exchange for compensation. These partnerships often require disclosure to maintain transparency. 4️⃣ Digital Products: Bloggers can create and sell digital products like e-books, online courses, templates, stock photos, or premium content subscriptions. This allows them to leverage their expertise and provide value to their audience while earning revenue. 5️⃣ Freelance Services: Some bloggers use their blog as a platform to showcase their skills and attract freelance clients for services like writing, graphic design, social media management, or consultation. 6️⃣ Donations or Subscriptions: If your readers appreciate your content and want to support you directly, you can give them the option to donate or subscribe to premium memberships. This relies on building strong relationships with your audience and providing exclusive benefits. It's worth mentioning that the success of monetizing a blog depends on attracting and engaging a substantial audience. This requires consistent creation of high-quality content, effective promotion through social media, search engine optimization (SEO), and building an email list to nurture relationships with your readers. Regarding web hosting, HostGator is a popular choice for bloggers due to its affordable pricing plans and reliable services. They offer various hosting options like shared hosting, dedicated servers, and WordPress hosting. HostGator provides 24/7 customer support, a user-friendly control panel, free website migration, and a 45-day money-back guarantee. Remember, blogging success doesn't happen overnight; it requires dedication, continuous learning, flexibility in adapting to industry trends, and perseverance.

Think of how many times you’ve walked across the floor of a store, touched a shelf (metal), and received a slight shock. Same thing. Your walking across the floor builds up an electric charge by the friction of your feet walking across the floor or carpet of the store. When you touch the shelf, it’s discharged. You rub on a balloon and it creates friction, slide across the old-fashioned bench seats in older cars and get a shock when you touch the door. I remember once thinking I would defeat the shock I got to my lips when I drank from the building water fountain, so I took my coffee cup to catch the water without the shock.

This is not only fast to download but also leaves a positive impact on SEO and user experience. 2) The components of vue.js are actually stored in separate files, i.e a file for each component, which makes the code easier to read and understand. 3) Since it depends on the JavaScript framework, it makes easier for integrations to happen. 4) Apart from the technical aspects, a separate hurray for the documentation is essential. The documentation actually helps personas ranging from newbies to tech say people and much more. Cons of Vue.js: 1) Language barriers become a big challenge when it comes to English speaking engineers. 2) Sometimes many features can make it look overwhelming, thus making it difficult for developer teams to choose the right option. 3) Lack of community becomes quite a lag, this is simply because it is the newest of technologies and needs more time to evolve & adopt more techies."},{"prompt":"here been an increase in UFO activity since the Voyager satellite left our solar system?","completion":"I think UFO sightings sort of come and go, back in the 60’s and 70’s there were many stories about these sightings then they seemed to just go away; my assumption is that if these are real then they have been around a long time and so having sent vehicles from Earth to a point beyond the Solar System will make no difference at all. Now it is believed that these Unidentified Aerial Phenomena go back to the ending of World War Two and in particular to the detonation of atomic devices. We cannot be sure if these things even exist, they may be something that our science cannot explain and not aliens but I digress, so we are now seeing these things again and some governments are now more open that there are things that they cannot explain using normal science. Lastly; who says we have sent probes beyond our Solar System? The Oort Cloud reaches out half way to the nearest star system meaning that none of our devices like Voyager have yet left our star system."},{"prompt":"Are atoms observable? If not, can you explain atomic theory and the history of its inception?","completion":"Well The answer would, of course, depend on your definition of \\"observe.\\" With our eyes? Obviously not. Using a microscope? Still no, as others have pointed out. I'm not sure when the theory came about. Allegedly some philosopher once was given credit for coming up with the idea, but it's a fairly common thread and I think he had the right idea. There probably is some level of indivisibily (that things can't be broken down after a certain point) but we now know this isn't the atom. At the time and for quite a while after we proved their existence we still thought that to be the case, but later realized there was some underlying mechanics to how they behaved and that led to the realization that there were more components and so forth. We now are beginning to (I believe) arrive at the conclusion that at the end of the day there is no real matter at all and that it's merely a set of purely abstract rules that... Perhaps only exist in theory, not materially. But never the less, in the same way we view our reality to be real, we can account for atoms, if not through direct observation, then by inference as is typically the case with all scientific discoveries, at least nowadays that science is far exceeding our grasp as mere mortals. We must use things far beyond our senses to obvserve the universe. In the case of the images people displayed those were done with electron microscopes, thus contradicting the idea of the atom in their existence, but allowing us to observe something so small we once thought there could be nothing smaller. Since light literally can't be resolved any further than the frequency of the wave (otherwise it's a shot in the dark that you will even detect anything since its all empty space anyway) we had to find another way to make an image and this was done by firing electrons (presumably in a particular way at different angles (I'm guessing) in order to react with some kind of photographic plate of a larger size) that we can detect with optical instruments and ultimately our eyes). Anyway, so to answer your question, can we see them? Idk, can we really see anything for sure? Hehe. How can you be sure you're not just crazy and imagined everything like a brilliant genius God mastermind trapped with no real world, lost in thought alone? Welcome to my world...

One notable current example is the ISS, which has been in a unchanged orbit for many years and, more importantly, is quite large compared with other satellites with a distinctive profile making it easy to observe and identify. Astronomical observatories or academic departments often publish schedules listing available times for space station overflights visible from their local areas. A more notorious current example has been the frequent launches into orbit of Spacex Starlink satellites, which appear as so-called “trains” of dozens of satellites moving like man-made stars across the pre-dawn or post-dusk skies all over the world. These have been frequently observed and much appreciated by enthusiasts all over the world as they make their way towards their ultimate orbital destinations, forming a global network of thousands of communications satellites. Astronomers have been less appreciative, finding the satellites to leave streaks of unwanted light across their carefully composed astronomical photographs. Spacex has responded by redesigning the more recent generations of satellites to make them less reflective, a still-ongoing project. First demonstrations of their communications capabilities are coming out as of autumn 2020, delivering the excellent communications performance for which they were designed. It seems that the project will be a huge success and a huge money-maker for Spacex, and a great benefit to people around the world who have been cut off from internet and other communications services by obstacles from geography and terrain, not to mention ships at sea or aircraft in flight.

It lost the 2010 election because of perceived mismanagement of the economy. And I think that perception was correct. I think that they spent far too much money propping up banks and while it was right to support Lloyds, I think that Royal Bank of Scotland should have been put into a managed liquidation, much the same way as Northern Rock and Bradford and Bingley were. It was said that Royal Bank of Scotland was too big to be allowed to fail but it was also the case that it had debts that were too large to be supported. It was a bit of a Catch 22 but I do think that managed bankruptcy would have been the lesser evil, as far as the economy was concerned. One way that it could have been done is to sell off NatWest with only viable debts and then sell the personal and business current accounts of RBS, leaving a hulk that could go bankrupt. Even now, the company is somewhat zombified. It might eventually recover but at a huge long-term cost to the country. The elections of 2015, 2017 and 2019 were lost because Labour lurched further and further to the left and created less and less believable manifestos. In 2017, the apparent revival of Labour was wholly fuelled by the Conservatives’ disastrous campaign. In 2019, the Conservatives slightly improved their vote share from a high base and Labour slumped back to just above where it was in 2015. Labour’s outgoing leadership is made up of Marxists and Trotskyites. Such extreme views do not appeal to the British public and however much the manifesto was window dressed, the far-left views of the leadership showed. Momentum likes to present itself as an ordinary group of left-wing people that collectively acts to influence Labour but it is actually the most successful entryist movement that I am aware of in history. It has usurped Labour from centrists (within Labour, actually quite left-wing) and moderates. Momentum has managed to discredit Tony Blair and his entire New Labour movement, despite the fact that he was Labour’s most successful leader in the party’s history. Yes, Tony Blair made some serious errors and led the UK into the Second Iraq War in support of the US and the judgments he made leading up to that were seriously flawed. Few people dispute that. But, set aside that the good he did both for his party and the country. Like most leaders, he was neither all good nor all bad but Momentum make him out to be the devil! Even the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats acknowledge the good he did in some areas but the Labour left see him as all bad. Momentum is a significant reason why many people won’t vote Labour for the foreseeable future, even if they’re Labour’s natural constituency. To win again, Labour needs to embrace the political centre, as it did under Tony Blair."},{"prompt":"w did a plane crash on the upper floors of the World Trade Center result in the entire building collapsing?","completion":"Physics.

SAS is a Stats programming language that is widely used by data scientists and statisticians to perform data manipulation and analysis. It is an easy-to-use data analysis software and has a large support community and huge number of third party add-ons, which makes it highly customizable to meet business needs. On the other hand, R is a programming language that has become the data science programming language of choice among data scientists. R is a very flexible language that is able to do complex analysis, visualization and create elegant reports. R is very powerful, but can be a little tricky to use and can have a steep learning curve.

The tempo and Rhythm of the band is the biggest difference from the Caribbean style. In Vietnam the dances are called what the French named them, for example: Salsa, Rhumba, Hop, Swing, Waltz, and Bolero.

When I was about 12 or 13 I started having pain in my right thigh/hip (which would gradually move toward my back) after a couple days my mom took me to a walk in clinic kinda thing incase it was something more than growing pains. According to research I did, it kinda felt like a DVT (deep vein thrombosis) I just didn't have many of the other symptoms. Doctor checks me out, nothing seems out of the ordinary. Tells me to take advil, which I had tried (but it didn't help) and see my GP if the pain persists. The pain got worse and began moving to my back so I went to my GP (who was awful) who checked me out, didn't really find much because my only symptoms were pain and fatigue and he gave me a prescription for basically Aleve (which I had tried, it didn't help), and tells me to try that, go do some lab work (which I did promptly) and send him if the pain persists. Pain gets worse yet. The time of day was right and my mom was fed up enough that she just took me to the ER. They checked me out, did some bloodwork, I think did some kind of scanning/imaging. Couldn't find anything. Gave me a prescription for tylenol-3 (tylenol with codeine) which I had already tried, it didn't help. And told me to come back or see my GP if the pain persists. One night it got really bad and my mom took me to the ER, I wrote an answer to a question here on quora about that night. At this point it's starting to sound odd because a GP, walk in clinic, and another ER hadn't found anything. They however give me a shot of some much more powerful painkiller and that was the first night I wasn't in pain for months, but of course they can't give a prescription for that drug, however they can give me a very small prescription of a similar drug but a very small one and I'd have to see my GP to get more. Well the pain is still bad. I went back to my GP, he wouldn't even keep up with the now used up Tylenol-3 the first ER trip got me. My bloodwork and scans were clean. That was when he decided to ‘talk’ with me and heavily suggest that losing weight would solve all my problems. He implied that not only was I in pain because I was overweight (by about 20-30 pounds), but he also implied that the weight was causing me to not have friends and maybe if I lost weight, I'd get friends, and I wouldn't be in pain anymore because my friends would pay attention to me. He sent me away with more knock-off and more expensive Aleve-drug prescription and the suggestion to see a nutritionist and another doctor at a different clinic. I go see this other doctor because my GP made an appointment for me with this woman. She listened and decided my pain would go away if I drank more water. So at this point I'd been in pain for 3 months, had tried every other the counter pain medication out there with no relief, and was being told my problems would go away if I drank water, lost weight, or made friends. I was frustrated and this was making me feel more depressed then I already had been. I gave up and suffered in silence, I told my mom the pain disappeared even though it lingered for another month before gradually disappearing. I later found out that clinical depression can manifest it's self as physical pain. I had been depressed before, during, and after. So I really was in pain, but there was no injury or physical illness to cause it. My GP, the other doctor, and multiple ER docs and nurses, all thought I was faking, looking for attention, and/or looking for drugs because no one thought to ask me during this how I felt mentally and emotionally. Looking back, I'm mad at myself for not figuring it out sooner, and I'm mad at the GP and other doctor who barely knew me, saw me as a 12–13 y/o girl who was probably just looking for attention and wrote my pain off as nothing. I won't say it was a ‘when you hear hooves pounding, assume horses not zebras’ kinda thing, but it wasn't an obvious answer that medical professionals never figured out."},{"prompt":"When is the right time to hire a virtual assistant for your Amazon Fba business?","completion":"when your business is at his peak and its difficult to manage so you can hire a VA who can tackle all the things for or if you have investment but dont have a time to work so you can also hire a virtual assistent one of the most brillant VA is giving his services on Fiver so you can contact him if you want here is a link [LINKED_TEXT: https://bit.ly/3MgWqhy] [URL: https://bit.ly/3MgWqhy]"},{"prompt":"there anything about the Kobe Bryant helicopter crash that just doesn’t add up?","completion":"In the helicopters I have flown in, they had radar altimeters, which give immediate distance to the ground.

When all dreaming collapses, what is left is witnessing, pitch blackness with utter peace and eternal vastness, no sense and trace of motion of any kind. Non of that is a state even, because a state is something that is of consciousness. There is something that i can’t really put into words, i would not call it a sense because it would not be accurate, but it is something like aliveness or being, yet it is not a being like existing. There is simply witnessing behind all this that we call experience/existence. In that pitch blackness a light shines for eternity, there is an eternal rest in light and peace.

Regi George, who is now 52, and Lalitha Regi, now 51, had found the tribal people of the region to be the worst sufferers in the country as far as health care was concerned when they first met them so they started an outpatient unit in 1993 at a small thatched hut. They started off with a bit of our personal savings and because the tribal people were very friendly, they helped us with the materials and the labour for putting up a mud and thatch hut. The situation was so bad that till 1992, one in every five children died before celebrating the first birthday and many mothers died during childbirth. For the people of the state, reaching the nearest hospital was a tough task since there was no proper public transport and the nearest hospital was 48 km away. Today, THI has not just grown into a full-fledged 24-bed primary care hospital in Sittilingi valley but also runs outreach clinics, besides conducting educational programmes in 21 villages. They see about 150-200 out patients in a day thrice a week. Also, the tribal girls were trained as health workers. The infant mortality rate decreased from 147 to 2 in thousand.

Christianity was initially just one of the many religious groups competing for influence and by Constantine the Great’s age, Christians made up around 10% of the population, mainly concentrated in the East. The privileges that Constantine and his sons conferred on the Christian Church, such as allowing bishops to offer judgments in civil cases and the right to use the public posting system for travel, as well as their patronizing of the faith meant that Christianity was able to spread rapidly around the Empire and in 380 Theodosius I the Great made Nicene Christianity the official faith of the Roman Empire. Although there remained pagans in the Roman (Byzantine) Senate until the reign of Justinian (527 - 565) and rural populations in the interior of Asia Minor retained pagan customs until the seventh century (and possibly even later), it was clear that Christianity had become the dominant religion in the Empire. While whether Christianity was morally superior or not to the pagan religions of ancient Rome is something that depends on one’s personal views, Christianity did have some beneficial moral effects. The Christian religion’s attitude towards warfare has long been criticized, especially by Enlightenment scholars, as undermining the Roman martial ethos. While such attitudes were exaggerated, it is generally true that Christianity did not have a wholly positive view of warfare and one could argue that this was a moral improvement. The view of Basil of Caesarea (330 - 379), highly influential in the Orthodox Church, was: Our fathers did not consider killings committed in the course of wars to be classifiable as murders at all, on the score, it seems to me, of allowing a pardon to men fighting in defense of sobriety and piety. Perhaps, though, it might be advisable to refuse them communion for three years, on the ground that their hands are not clean. Of course, not everyone had such strict views on warfare. In his Letter to Amun, Athanasius (328 – 373) had a somewhat less strict view: Although one is not supposed to kill, the killing of the enemy in time of war is both a lawful and praiseworthy thing. This is why we consider individuals who have distinguished themselves in war as being worthy of great honors, and indeed public monuments are set up to celebrate their achievements. It is evident, therefore, that at one particular time, and under one set of circumstances, an act is not permissible, but when time and circumstances are right, it is both allowed and condoned. Nevertheless, it is generally true that the Church’s attitude towards warfare was different than before. When Emperor Nicephorus Phocas proposed that all soldiers who fall in battle against Muslims should be named martyrs, the patriarch Polyeuctus (956 to 970 ) refused his demand. The Christian religion also encouraged welfare towards the poorest in society. The early Christian communities encouraged Christians to offer support to those in need (for example offering free food, etc.) and this aided the spread of Christianity. This attitude towards welfare was continued by the organized Christian Church. The Church thus played an active role in civic life, funding hospitals, poorhouses, and hospices and also ensuring the retention of institutional bathing as an element of Roman/Byzantine life in major cities, especially Constantinople. The establishment of hospitals was especially important not only in terms of welfare but also in developing healthcare. In \\"Xenons\\" hospitals, mainly attached to Monasteries, there was the possibility for offering systematic and organized medical care: internal medicine, surgery, gynaecology, and ophthalmology were practiced in corresponding separate wings. The state also did establish hospitals, orphanages which housed, fed and educated orphans, in­stitutions for lepers, and hospices and inns in various cities and on roads to provide food and shelter for travelers. In fact some scholars argue that the origins of the welfare state go back to Roman/Byzantine welfare policies, which were decisively influenced by the Christian Church. Christianity also had a more positive influence in the treatment of slaves. For example marking slaves with hot iron, as it was happening some cases, was banned while the ability of masters to put to death their slaves for no reason was severely restricted. Emperor Justinian’s laws ensured that freed slaves would have full civic rights and simplified the procedure for freeing slaves. Castrating a slave automatically made them free. Emperor Leo IV allowed slaves to dispose property in wills. Slaves were not allowed to marry but this was legalized by Alexios Komnenos in 1095. The legal system, under the influence of Christian morality also moved in a more humane direction. A prisoner would not be kept in total darkness but had to be given the outdoors and daylight. Constantine the Great prohibited the abduction of girls and instituted punishment for such abductors. Constantine also made divorce harder, imposing severe conditions when demands came from only one side. A man could divorce his wife for reasons of adultery, poisoning, and pandering; in that case he would retain her dowry. If he divorced for another reason however, he had to return the dowry and was forbidden to marry again. Gladiatorial games were ordered to be eliminated in 325. - Saint Ambrose barring Theodosius from Milan Cathedral Christianity also influenced the imperial office. The Christian Roman/Byzantine Emperor was expected to exemplify Christian virtues. While there were plenty of bad and cruel Christian Roman Emperors, there was no Caligula or Nero and such behavior was not tolerated for long. The Emperor had to show, even for reasons of propaganda only, virtues such as generosity and restraint. When the Emperor failed to exude such virtues, he was either branded a tyrant or had to repent (either truly or for PR reasons). An example of this was the reaction to the massacre of Thessalonica. In 390, the troops of Emperor Theodosius the Great massacred the inhabitants of Thessalonica as punishment for the murder of Butheric (magister militum of Illyria). Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, stood up to the Emperor upon hearing news of the massacre. He refused to celebrate a mass in the Emperor's presence, until Theodosius repented. For eight months Theodosius was weeping and he was forgiven only after he had agree to promulgate a law, which in cases of death sentences would introduce a thirty-day lag before the execution. Overall, while whether Christianity was morally superior to the pagan religions of Rome is something that is dependent on one’s personal views, it is indisputable that the Christian Church had at least some positive moral impact on the Roman Empire."},{"prompt":"Which is your favourite World Test Championship knock?","completion":"Rishabh pant knock of 89 against Australia at Gabba in the series decider is my favourite WTC knock.

This should be good”, I thought. Another grad student and I took turns testing him, then met in the supply closet to describe the “symptoms” that we observed in him. Trust me, the average “civilian” has no idea what authentic amnesia looks like. It was quite entertaining and a source of knee-slapping laughs. Needless to say, he didn’t qualify for a disability check. Made my day."},{"prompt":"What is the best way to describe the position of the Flemish Movement in Belgium?

It won't happen because everyone else is against it, joining the Netherlands would not make us Independant and also is not what these parties would want. Another issue is that it would make us even more irrelevant than we already are and bring along a lot of nonsense in the sense of a brexit but probably worse So 99.99% this won't happen even if there is some support for this from one or two political parties out of the 8–10 relevant political parties.

Long story short, Kids in a peaceful environment might interpret happiness very differently, but for me, it was to see the end of the war and have peace. In my opinion, happiness can be subjective and influenced by various factors. From where I stand, I see three fundamental elements that consistently contribute to human happiness. Meaningful RelationshipsPursuit of Personal Growth and MeaningGratitude and Mindfulness I have seen that good-quality relationships help humans be happy even if they live in a war-torn country. Meaningful relationships encompass not only family bonds but also friendships, romantic partnerships, and even connections within communities and social circles. Prioritizing the cultivation of meaningful relationships can significantly impact an individual's overall happiness. Finding purpose and meaning can take various forms, including pursuing meaningful careers, engaging in hobbies, contributing to the community through volunteer work, or developing a spiritual connection. It is essential to explore one's interests and continually strive for personal development to unlock the path to long-lasting happiness. Being grateful and appreciating the positive aspects of life, even amidst challenges and difficulties, is an undeniable truth for beginning to be happy in life. Finally, as individuals, we have the power to shape our own happiness by fostering positive connections, embracing personal growth, and cultivating gratitude and mindfulness. By incorporating these elements into our daily lives, we can unlock the door to genuine and sustainable happiness. Remember, happiness is not a destination but a journey, and it is within our reach."},{"prompt":"forgot my Apple ID password how can I reset it?","completion":"Your Question Is: I forgot my apple id and password wats should i do?

Maintaining optimal blood sugar levels is essential for overall health and well-being. In this article, we will explore effective strategies to control blood sugar levels naturally and improve overall health. Understanding Blood Sugar # What is blood sugar? Blood sugar, also known as blood glucose, is the primary source of energy for the body's cells. It comes from the food we eat, and insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, helps transport glucose into the cells to be used for energy. # The importance of controlling blood sugar Balancing blood sugar levels is vital because consistently high levels can lead to complications such as diabetes, heart disease, and kidney problems. On the other hand, low blood sugar levels can cause dizziness, confusion, and, in severe cases, unconsciousness. Healthy Eating Habits # Incorporating a balanced diet One of the most effective ways to control blood sugar is by adopting a balanced diet. Focus on consuming whole grains, lean proteins, healthy fats, and plenty of fruits and vegetables. Avoid sugary and processed foods, as they can cause rapid spikes in blood sugar levels. # Portion control Controlling portion sizes is crucial, as even healthy foods can impact blood sugar if consumed excessively. By managing portion sizes, you can better manage your glucose levels and prevent unnecessary fluctuations. Regular Physical Activity # The benefits of exercise Engaging in regular physical activity can significantly impact blood sugar levels. Exercise helps your body use glucose more efficiently, making it easier to maintain stable levels. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week. # Types of exercises Combining aerobic exercises, such as brisk walking or cycling, with strength training can be especially beneficial for blood sugar control. Exercise not only improves insulin sensitivity but also aids in weight management, which is crucial for those at risk of diabetes. Managing Stress # Understanding the stress-blood sugar connection Chronic stress can lead to elevated blood sugar levels due to the release of stress hormones. Finding healthy ways to manage stress, such as meditation, yoga, or spending time in nature, can help regulate blood sugar levels. Quality Sleep # The link between sleep and blood sugar Inadequate sleep can disrupt insulin production and lead to insulin resistance, causing blood sugar levels to rise. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night to support overall health and maintain stable glucose levels. Hydration # The role of water Staying well-hydrated is essential for optimal blood sugar control. Water helps flush out excess sugar from the bloodstream and supports kidney function, which is crucial for individuals with diabetes. Limiting Alcohol Consumption # Alcohol's impact on blood sugar Excessive alcohol consumption can cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and interfere with diabetes medications. If you choose to drink, do so in moderation and always with food to help stabilize blood sugar levels. Regular Blood Sugar Monitoring # Importance of monitoring Regularly checking blood sugar levels is vital for understanding how your body responds to different foods and activities. It allows you to make informed decisions about your diet and lifestyle. Medication Management # Taking prescribed medications For individuals with diabetes, taking prescribed medications as directed by their healthcare provider is essential for blood sugar control. Never adjust medication dosages without consulting a healthcare professional. Conclusion Taking control of your blood sugar levels is crucial for maintaining overall health and well-being. By adopting a balanced diet, staying physically active, managing stress, getting quality sleep, staying hydrated, and monitoring blood sugar levels, you can lead a healthier and more fulfilling life. FAQs 1. **Can I reverse diabetes by controlling my blood sugar?** While lifestyle changes can significantly improve blood sugar levels and even lead to remission in some cases, diabetes is a complex condition, and not everyone can reverse it entirely. However, managing blood sugar effectively can greatly enhance one's quality of life. 2. **Is it necessary to take medication for blood sugar control?** For some individuals with diabetes, lifestyle changes alone may not be sufficient to manage blood sugar levels. Medication may be prescribed to achieve optimal glucose control, but it should always be done under medical supervision. 3. **How often should I check my blood sugar levels?** The frequency of blood sugar monitoring may vary depending on individual health conditions and the type of diabetes. Consult your healthcare provider to determine the appropriate testing schedule for you. 4. **Are there any specific foods that can help lower blood sugar levels?** Yes, certain foods, such as leafy greens, cinnamon, and nuts, have been associated with blood sugar-lowering properties. However, they should be part of a well-balanced diet and not used as a sole treatment method. 5. **Can stress alone cause diabetes?** Stress does not cause diabetes directly, but it can contribute to insulin resistance and impact blood sugar levels. Managing stress through healthy coping mechanisms is essential for overall health, including blood sugar control.

Dear Wife, I’m writing you this letter to tell you that I’m leaving you forever. I’ve been a good man to you for 7 years & I have nothing to show for it. These last 2 weeks have been hell. … Your boss called to tell me that you quit your job today & that was the last straw. Last week, you came home & didn’t even notice I had a new haircut, had cooked your favorite meal & even wore a brand new pair of silk boxers. You ate in 2 minutes, & went straight to sleep after watching all of your soaps. You don’t tell me you love me anymore; you don’t want sex or anything that connects us as husband & wife. Either you’re cheating on me or you don’t love me anymore; whatever the case, I’m gone. Your EX-Husband P.S. don’t try to find me. Your SISTER & I are moving away to West Virginia together! Have a great life! Dear Ex-Husband, Nothing has made my day more than receiving your letter. It’s true you & I have been married for 7 years, although a good man is a far cry from what you’ve been. I watch my soaps so much because they drown out your constant whining & griping. Too bad that doesn’t work. I did notice when you got a haircut last week, but the 1st thing that came to mind was ‘You look just like a girl!’. Since my mother raised me not to say anything if you can’t say something nice, I didn’t comment. And when you cooked my favorite meal, you must have gotten me confused with MY SISTER, because I stopped eating pork 7 years ago. About those new silk boxers: I turned away from you because the 49.99 price tag was still on them, & I prayed it was a coincidence that my sister had just borrowed 50 from me that morning. After all of this, I still loved you & felt we could work it out. So when I hit the lotto for 10 million dollars, I quit my job & bought us 2 tickets to Jamaica. But when I got home you were gone... Everything happens for a reason, I guess. I hope you have the fulfilling life you always wanted. My lawyer said that the letter you wrote ensures you won’t get a dime from me. So take care. Signed, Your Ex-Wife, Rich As Hell & Free! P.S. I don’t know if I ever told you this, but my sister Carla was born Carl. I hope that’s not a problem. Source: A Whatsapp forward.

It makes sense - parents willing to spend money on school while also already paying property taxes to fund public schools have a unique social pressure to perform in ways public school students don’t. That pressure can also exist on public school students from society and parents (such as top notch public schools), but in an environment where detractors (drugs, bad kids, bullies, stupid kids, troublemakers) exist, it can sabotage that pressure.

You haven’t given your age, or whether you are pre- or post-menopausal. You haven’t even given your sex, as breast cancer in men (which accounts for 1% of cases) is often treated by mastectomy. I assume that by HR positive you mean ER positive, or maybe you don’t. What about the progestagen receptors? What about the excision margins? Were they clear? Close? Involved? What about other pathology, medical history, medicines you might be taking, family history, occupation… ? There are many different factors to take into account when advising on treatment. Is this the final diagnosis or is it provisional? In the UK all oncology pathology results have to be reviewed by a pathologist specialising in that specific cancer, and then the case discussed in a multidisciplinary meeting before any course of management can be recommended. When I was treating breast cancer (over 20 years ago) wide local excision combined with radiotherapy was regarded as an alternative to mastectomy for smallish, low-grade tumours, and combining them would be overkill. Similarly, the thinking was that if the tumour was low-grade and the nodes not involved then the chance of recurrence was sufficiently low that adding chemotherapy would not make a great deal of difference. With ER or PR positivity there is also the option of hormone treatment. However, that was 20 years ago and there has been a great deal of change in oncology treatment since then. You will get a much better answer from seeing an oncologist who knows you and has access to all the details of your case, as well as the opportunity to confirm them all."},{"prompt":"Will Akhilesh Yadav be able to form his government this time in the Uttar Pradesh 2022 elections?","completion":"Chances are very less for ex-CM Akhilesh Yadav to win 2022 elections and to form his Govt. in UP as he's not done anything in the last five years for the people in the State, as a responsible Opposition except doing vaccination politics as against BJP Govt.

That’s the important thing to remember: they are trained infantry soldiers whose primary role is to fight! They just also have ceremonial duties sometimes, too. Their weapon is the L85A2 assault rifle, same as used by all the British Army (some units now receiving the A3 upgrade). Whether in combat in Afghanistan or guarding Buckingham Palace, it’s the same weapon they have. Though in the latter it’ll be more polished, cleaner, and will have a polished bayonet on the end. They have a 30-round magazine of live ammunition loaded into it and are ready to respond at a moment’s notice should anything untoward happen, such as someone trying to storm into the Palace."},{"prompt":"Why should we not use firecrackers on the occasion of Diwali?","completion":"This is a picture of a Peepal leaf from the tree infront of my house in Delhi. I have captured it few days back in 3rd of November. The right side is kept as it is and the left side has been cleaned by me just to show the contrasting shades of the same leaf. When I started moving my fingers over it, I found thick layers of dust present on the leaf. I am not talking about a single layer but several layers. I started observing such huge amount of dust (pollutants) since the start of october. Unfortunately, I have not clicked any picture of the leaf back then but it looked something similar to the left side. Here is a picture of a leaf from the same tree taken in the rainy season. No dust particles present on it due to the rain. Even the colour is vibrant due to the seasonal effect. The colour is supposed to be changed by November for sure but that is not the point. The point is about the layer of pollutants which can be seen adding a pale look to the leaves. Diwali is yet to arrive but I have already started feeling the pollution around me. It is quite easily felt through the nose and eyes. You don't need any special equipment to detect it. You can literally smell it. Now coming to the main question. I will always support banning crackers on Diwali. But is that enough ? Absolutely not. Banning only crackers and that too only on Diwali is similar to protecting yourself from a heavy rain with just your hands over your head. It may help you to save a small portion of your head from getting wet but it cannot save you from the real damage. You'll be wet head to toe. And if you are lucky then your mobile phone will be still working fine. A report by Central Pollution Control Board found that vehicular and industrial pollution is the primary reason for the air pollution in Delhi. [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #PKBcp] It is true that the pollution level increases beyond what is already accepted as hazardous during diwali and the subsequent 2–3 days. People with respiratory problems find it very difficult on these days. Who knows several deaths also must be happening due to this but never got reported. The bigger as well as effective solution is somewhere else. Banning crackers in Diwali is welcome but its effect is reflected only on newspaper headlines and does no good in reducing the pollution significantly on an average. We need better solutions. We need the governemt to act on eco-friendly solutions. We need the people to adopt eco-friendly solutions. It is a combined task for all of us. We can't stop everything but we can control the things for a certain extent for sure. The trade off between the development and the environment has always been there since the beginning of modern civilization. We need to find a perfect balance and keep moving ahead. As I said, banning crackers will catch only the headlines while the real damage will continue from somewhere else.

No! Try not to eat many sweet foods such as biscuits, cakes, chocolate, slices, although an occasional small serve of the above is OK. If the medical professional examined the diets of women with breast cancer they would probably find that they eat a lot of dairy foods such as cheese, yoghurt, butter, cream, milk amd other types of dairy. These should be reduced considerably along with reducing meat intake, alcohol and fried foods. It is necessary also to increase intake of water- not tap water or bottled water, but home-filtered water and aim to drink between 6–8 glasses per day, along with a daily vegetable juice. Doctors do need to lift their game and start to do their own research on the diets of women with breast cancer to see if there is a pattern of certain foods which could reveal a link which might be associated with breast cancer??

Not that the evidence to support your case is not abundantly available, its that some people are so emotionally devoted to their belief that no amount of evidence will make any difference. Your more likely to encounter a case of cognitive dissonance if you present logical objective evidence that refutes the premise they are emotionally attached too. That being said, you might start with helping your spouse understand the Bible objectively.. That God does exist, Jesus is real, but that the stories as we have them in the Bible have been passed down and exaggerated over time. Case point.. David and Goliath.. The story in the Bible as many have it.. is Goliath was 6 cubits and a span.. 9 foot 6 inches. The largest person verified to have lived is only 8 foot 11 - Robert Wadlow he died fairly young.. because as medically understood the human physiology doesn’t scale up.. People of that size are really frail gentle giants.. So 9 foot 6 inches would seem formidable, except he probably wouldn’t have lasted one battle, so how does Goliath get the fame? Enter the Dead Sea Scrolls.. which has a scroll that describes Goliath as 4 cubits and a span.. 6′ 6″ A much more physiologically sound. A warrior of that stature would be about 1 foot taller than the average man of the time, and not beyond the limits of human anatomy.. The point of this is to demonstrate the stories get exaggerated for religious purposes. An interesting bit to the goliath story , is that the difference between an Hebrew 4 and 6 is the length of a stroke in the character.. short stroke is 6 , long stroke is 4. So it’s likely that at scribe wrote a shorter than normal stroke for the height of Goliath.. changing thus making him 6 cubits and a span versus four cubits and a span.. the exaggeration works for religious purposes so it carried on.. So back to Noah.. the story is likely based upon a real event.. The Bosporus Break, which flooded the area we now know is the Black Sea. One must look at the story from the eyes of those who would have experienced it and passed it down. A stone aged man living in the valley of where the Black Sea is , may have received some divine inspiration to build a vessel to save his family and livestock from an impending deluge. When the Bosporus broke and poured the Mediterranean sea into the valley which now comprises the Black Sea.. coincide this with a rain storm that lasted many days.. and you have the making of the story.. Noah , living in such a valley would not likely have seen the Bosporus breach, but simply experienced the water levels rising to the point that “His” entire world (What he can observe- probably less than 100 miles in any direction) was completely covered in water. To Noah, the entire earth has been flooded.. until his craft came to rest on the “mountains of Ararat”.. not to be confused with Mt Ararat. the former being a region in ancient Armenia. So his story is passed along orally for thousands of years. Likely embellished and exaggerated for moral religious purposes until it was written into the manuscripts we have for the Biblical Text... So perhaps you can reassure your spouse that the God is real, there was a person like Noah, but the Bible text isn’t the inerrant word of God, such would make it a sort of Idol.. Instead, it maybe God inspired, it may “contain” God’s inerrant word to people of ancient times, but it also contains the word so fallible humans as well. God may have inspired it’s original authors, but that inspiration was meant for an ancient people, not us, and it wasn’t necessarily intended to be preserved.. that was a effort of fallible men.. and the manuscript evidence proves that men did a fairly poor job of preserving.. So the inerrant Word of God comes from only one source… God himself, not a translation of an ancient text that has passed through many many fallible human hands and minds. Encourage your spouse to go straight to the source.. Hope that helps."},{"prompt":"What's a good digital marketing agency in the UAE?","completion":"Webdigitalize [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #DtfvW] top digtial marketing agency in dubai.

Sometimes I wonder if I would’ve liked living in the 1800s better because there wasn’t as many people and there wasn’t phones and computers everywhere. But then again, I love the outdoors and that’s why I got rid of my office jobs. It’s spending too much time indoors, too much TV, too much Facebook, and comparing yourself to others! There are some conspiracy theories that you may want to take a look at that are fairly compelling. But, it’s traffic, more people… Which means more crime, more confrontations, more arguments, more competition. Pressures nowadays are different from pressures years ago. People used to live more simple lives. I’m not talking about the farmer who grows his crops and goes home to his wife at night and reads a book to the kids on the farm. I am referring to the modern day complexities and all of the different issues that are available at our fingertips. People back then couldn’t pull up the latest news on their phone and find out that we just gave Ukraine 2 billion worth of 16s when we could have been feeding our own citizens and veterans. didn’t mean to get political just then, but anyway… Life’s just more complicated nowadays.

Like other relationships, coordination and consistency are needed in the one among you and your team. And what good strategy to take the opportunity to relax down to assure the staff knows the goals and they can do it? Here are 5 steps you can take any time you have a sprint preparation meeting. Step 1: Evaluate Your Product Roadmap An agile sprint is aimed at delivering improved applications. Yet it is said better than finished. When you’re knee-deep in code changes, it’s simple to lose vision of the bigger image. How do you do the correct thing about what you’re concentrating on? As the product owner, you must still have a high-level vision of the work in mind. You have to check the project roadmap and urge critical questions before discussing or doing some form of sprint preparation. Are you designing features that drive your vision for the product forward? Can you have a view of the work, or are you just responding to noisy consumers? The first step in sprint preparation is to decide where you want to be in 6 months, a year, or longer, not just after this sprint. Step 2: Have an Updated List of User Stories Before the Sprint Planning Meeting In an ideal, transparent environment, the team will pick up the words you have written about users a month ago and quickly start working on them. That’s rarely the case. Your users would have been requesting for many functionalities to be added to your product after your last update. You will have to take in all these factors to make adjustments to the customer stories to make sure they are tested before heading into the preparation meeting for sprints. Now the dilemma most teams have is, “how many customer stories are we going to update?” The perfect scenario is to update them all. But, unless the product is relatively new and thin, that is an unlikely feat. Step 3: Meeting Arrangements Send the invite and make sure that all your teammates are able to attend the meeting without any inconvenience. Print the target of the sprint and position it somewhere conspicuous in the conference space. Have freely available sticky notes in various colors. Write down team speed in bold letters. Write down a reference rate (agreed upon by everyone), which may be the last sprint speed or an average of the previous three sprints. It will help if you use a comparison velocity of 8 story points per programmer per sprint if it’s the first sprint for your team. Ensure that it is obvious what each sticky color reflects. For starters, green is for stories about people, blue is for tasks, and purple is for bugs. Get the stories written on the stickies and place them in preference order on the wall. Be sure to do the same with remote teams, like in the sprint or backlog. Also, arrange light refreshments or coffee and make sure that the environment is comfortable. Step 4: Utilize Data and Expertise to Supercharge Your Sprint Planning Conference The sprint preparation meeting(s) will set the tone for the following few working weeks or months. The more planning you can do in advance, the better. That’s why the [LINKED_TEXT: Scrum Guide] [URL: https://www.scrum.org/resources/scrum-guide] recommends timeboxing the sprint preparation meeting for a month-long sprint to just 8 hours. Your schedules should be changed accordingly for faster sprints. Your scrum master is accountable for ensuring these discussions happen and the team is sticking to the list. Step 5: Collaboratively Plan a Sprint Backlog It’s time to worry about the “how” you’re going to do it with a sprinting target in mind. Sprint Backlog is a list of several user stories that you have updated in the previous steps and predicted. The challenge is to find a list of user accounts, assignments, and glitches that can help you accomplish the goal and can be achieved within the sprint’s span. The team must choose the sprint things and scale of the sprint backlog collectively. Since they are the individuals who contribute to the fulfillment of the products, they also have to be the ones who pick what they contribute."},{"prompt":"Without looking at a map, how well can you draw the shape of your country?","completion":"Well, let’s see… Australia, huh?

Going in order, JFK's father, Joseph Kennedy, carefully curated his public image as a family man, but behind closed doors, he was a prolific womanizer who didn't bother to hide his affairs from his family. As a father, I'm sometimes surprised at how many meaningless (to me) things I do/say ultimately resonate with my children, but there's no mystery about the Kennedy household: the boys were taught that they didn't owe their wives faithfulness and that they could do whatever they wanted in their private lives as long as they maintained public appearances. As a child growing up in such an environment, JFK was likely to go in one of two directions: either he would reject his father's behavior or imitate it. He obviously went with door #2. And second, I'm reminded of an old Norm Mcdonald joke about Tiger Woods; the punchline was that given the hundreds of opportunities he had to cheat every day, he was actually a pretty good husband in comparison to the average guy who might have 5 chances to cheat in his lifetime. JFK was not anyone's idea of a model husband, but he did have women throwing themselves at him right and left, which he obviously took advantage of as a reckless playboy."},{"prompt":"w do travel websites like Trivago work?","completion":"Website live Trivago is Metasearch engines.

Some of the possible factors include: Social media: Social media can be a double-edged sword, as it can provide a platform for connection and communication, but it can also create feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and low self-esteem. The constant exposure to carefully curated images and updates from peers can create a sense of inadequacy and FOMO (fear of missing out).Academic pressure: Young people today are under immense pressure to excel academically and succeed in a highly competitive job market. The stress of maintaining good grades, balancing extracurricular activities, and preparing for standardized tests can take a toll on mental health.Economic insecurity: Many young people today face economic uncertainty and instability, with high student debt, low-paying jobs, and a lack of affordable housing. This can create feelings of hopelessness and despair, which can contribute to depression.Environmental factors: The fast-paced, technology-driven society of today can be overwhelming and stressful, leading to feelings of anxiety and burnout.Stigma: Despite the increasing awareness and acceptance of mental health issues, there is still a stigma surrounding mental illness. This can prevent young people from seeking help and support, which can worsen their symptoms. It's important to note that mental health issues are complex, and there is no single factor that can fully explain why some individuals are more vulnerable to depression than others.

No one could be dumb enough to name comic book characters Snowflake and Safe Space, right? RIGHT? And Vampire Boy? I can totally hear the thought process that went into his character design: “OK, kids today HATE the Twilight vampires, so we have to do something edgier. Make sure to make him look kinda scary, but not TOO scary because we want the girls to still think he’s hot. Give him some cool red hair (shaved on the sides of course) and he ONLY likes 90’s music.

I would just like to throw an analogy on the pile to help illustrate. If you need to measure the exact temperature of a sample of water, you need to stick a probe into it. The probe is room temperature. Sticking the probe into the water changes the temperature of the water around the probe. So you literally cannot exactly measure the temperature of the water using the probe because doing so changes the temperature that you are trying to measure. It is a loose analogy. But it is close enough to explain what is meant by the whole mess. And it puts it into a macroscopic sense that you can wrap your brain around."},{"prompt":"What is the best way for preparing for GATE CSE?","completion":"Formulate a practical study plan based on your strengths, weaknesses, approx. weightage of topics & the time you have for preparation. In case you are weak in areas that carry very little weightage then you can either cover it at the very end or skip it. We recommend studying for at least 4 hours every day. You can spend 2 hours on core subjects, 1 hour each on engineering mathematics & general aptitude. Attempt mock tests/previous year papers in the last 3-4 weeks. The figures mentioned below are based on previous year papers & are subject to change Pro-tips: Cement your understanding of a topic or concept by solving questions of all possible types based on it immediately after learning it.Spend the last 4-5 mins in the GATE exam guessing answers of the numerical value based problems that you aren’t able to solve. Don’t skip these questions since there is no negative marking.Quantitative Aptitude & mathematics alone are worth 30 marks in the GATE exam and can be quite high scoring if you put in the effort. Refer to “Quantitative Aptitude for competitive examinations by R S Aggarwal” & previous year question papers. Irrespective of which branch you are from, Testbook can be your one-stop shop for everything GATE.

It’s a training exercise. Its function is to give command candidates a foretaste of what real loss is like so that, hopefully, they’ll know how to deal with the possibility of losing without panic. The exercise also gives the instructors insight into the candidate’s character. You can’t fail. You also can’t pass. Data could go through the exercise in the captain’s seat. He may, in fact, have done so. His performance in in real-life situations where catastrophe seemed certain shows that he performs quite smoothly in situations that would likely drive most humans to distraction.

At that point, why not dub it the “Ship of Theseus 2.0”? Now, if you reconstructed the original, that just becomes the 1.0 once again. Another route would be to follow the same path as above, but to never reach the “2.0” point, since technically, nothing about the ship is new in terms of dimensions, use, or features. Granted, if you replaced the parts with more durable wood (or a more durable material in general), I feel an argument could be made to change to “2.0.”"},{"prompt":"What is the most incredible feat of human will?","completion":"I think it's impossible to beat the will of this guy, not only did he willingly chose his fate but if you watch he does not move an inch as he burned to death !"},{"prompt":"What's the most ridiculous thing a coworker told on you to your boss for?","completion":"I suppose it was when one of them told an internal news reporter I was living with my girlfriend who happened to be another elected official of the union I was heading.

The tone in which the question was asked, though, was so high and mighty and suggestive of some sort of secrecy or almost a ‘conspiracy to hide it’ type feeling, it has always stuck in my mind and made me laugh to recall it. It did get into the article that was published, though, as if anyone really cared. Oddly it came up again not long after when both of us were in a very tense meeting with our elected school board trustees and officials and I was trying to break the ice by chatting with my opposing negotiator from their team and said about one of our negotiations, ‘that was probably the most fun I ever had’ and my live-in down the table said, ‘I think I resent that.’ Every rolled on the floor laughing because it was still a ‘secret’ of sorts that no one felt they could mention (that we lived together), but the typical ‘spousal’ humor was exactly what it took to make the meeting go smoother thereafter.

I have seen many many people during my prepration, they are fooling themselves and falsely wanted to make an impression of a topper infront of everyone to enjoy little fame. Please please don't brag your knowledge infront of anyone, I am saying this because people generally don't know or their mind tricks them to do this kind of things to enjoy fame.Please don't use social media for the sake of refreshments, never means never. Yes you can use whatsapp but that too for GATE only, just forget your life with others and focus only on Gate.Don't waste your time by going malls, watching cinema or grouping with friends they aren't going anywhere. You can watch the cinema later after gate, roam the mall or any other places later with friends, but this crucial time never gonna come back and if you fail you will definitely cry for your mistakes. So it's better to avoid them.Beware, during prepration please don't do Babu-Shona too much or try to make a new relationship this isn't the correct time. You can pause your relationship or can have little talks but tell them to support you mentally and not to quarrel during this time.Never skip your mistakes analysis after giving test, first of all start your test series as early as possible and after each test analyse your mistakes intensively. The main purpose of a test series is to make you aware of your mistakes and to rectify them so use the test series properly.Never ever leave any subject completely, if you want to score good marks you have to prepare all subjects because you never know which subjects weightage gonna increase that year.

Generally speaking, we don’t seem to put any value in Math. As technology advances continue to happen, I would think having an understanding of Mathematics is even more important. There is a huge spotlight on student success, and Math and English are the main targets. Why? Any degree you get requires Math and English. There has been this movement to remove barriers so students can advance and get their degree. In a California Community College, 70% of our courses were at the remedial level (Arithmetic, Pre-Algebra, etc). Nowadays, no more than 10% of our courses are at the remedial level. That’s a massive problem. The solution for more success is worse than the problem presented. The same thing is occurring in English as well. In Public Schools, they have the completely idiotic “No Child Left Behind” act. You can have a student fail Math since the 5th grade and then throw that person into Algebra 1. You have students who are completely prepared for Algebra 1, and you have students who can’t add two numbers together. That’s a recipe for a complete disaster. There are numerous things that I have massive problems with. Their definition of success is so warped. I had a student that began with Algebra 1. She ended up taking me for Calculus 3 and Differential Equations. She is an engineering major and VERY smart. She will get a degree and I have no doubt will have multiple job offers. We don’t highlight those successes. They do occur. At the community college, you can’t measure success by how many people go to a university. People go to a community college for a variety of reasons (enrichment, job training , etc). There is no “one size fits all” approach. It’s not reality, and I think administrators are trying to look for that."},{"prompt":"What are the best ways to invest money?","completion":"What Are the Best Ways to Invest Money? Hey there, fellow Quora readers! Today, I wanted to share my personal insights and experiences on the best ways to invest money. Investing is a fantastic way to grow your wealth and secure a better financial future. While it may seem overwhelming at first, there are several straightforward and effective investment options that can help you make the most of your hard-earned money. So, let's explore the best ways to invest money together! 1.Start with an Emergency Fund: Before diving into investments, it's crucial to set aside some money for emergencies. Building an emergency fund ensures that you have a safety net in case of unexpected expenses or financial hardships. Aim to save three to six months' worth of living expenses in a separate savings account that is easily accessible. 2.Pay off High-Interest Debt: If you have any high-interest debts, such as credit card balances or personal loans, it's wise to prioritize paying them off before investing. This is because the interest you'll save from paying off debts is often higher than potential investment returns. By becoming debt-free, you'll have more disposable income available for investing. How Newbies Turn 20 Into 90,000 In 90 Days? (Not Crypto) Hey there! Forbes recently featured this astonishing software that has allowed thousands of everyday people turn 20 into over 100,000 in just 3 months… In fact, it is the same software that the top 1% of the hidden “elite” class of investors use to get returns of 150%, 500%, and even 10,000% sometimes within a few months or even weeks. The reason why this money making software is different from anything else out there is because unlike other systems, this one accurately predicts and filters out explosive stocks in the market before they explode. So you can buy stocks before they skyrocket in value from the very bottom, often for just pennies, and ride it all the way to the top! Without needing to read and study technical analysis… Without needing to look at fundamental analysis… Without paying some secret stock guru thousands of dollars to access it… [LINKED_TEXT: Check out hear] [URL: https://db7a258clck28ygbs2-2-2i8gs.hop.clickbank.net/] 3.Take Advantage of Retirement Accounts: One of the best ways to invest money is through retirement accounts, such as a 401(k) or an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). These accounts offer tax advantages and allow your investments to grow tax-free or tax-deferred. Contribute regularly to your retirement accounts, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. 4.Explore Index Funds or Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs): Index funds and ETFs are excellent investment options for beginners. These funds pool money from multiple investors and invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks or bonds that track a specific market index. They offer instant diversification, lower fees, and require less hands-on management compared to individual stock picking. 5.Consider Real Estate Investment: Real estate can be a profitable long-term investment option. You can invest in rental properties or real estate investment trusts (REITs). Rental properties provide rental income and the potential for property value appreciation over time. REITs, on the other hand, allow you to invest in real estate without directly owning properties. 6.Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification is key to managing risk and maximizing potential returns. Spread your investments across different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and even alternative investments like precious metals or cryptocurrencies. This helps protect your portfolio from the impact of a single investment's performance. 7.Stay Informed and Monitor Your Investments: Investing requires staying informed and keeping an eye on your investments. Stay updated on market trends, economic news, and any developments related to your investments. Regularly review your portfolio's performance and make adjustments as needed. However, avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market fluctuations. Conclusion: In conclusion, the best ways to invest money include building an emergency fund, paying off high-interest debt, taking advantage of retirement accounts, exploring index funds or ETFs, considering real estate investments, diversifying your portfolio, and staying informed about your investments. Remember, investing is a long-term game, and patience is key. By following these strategies and maintaining a disciplined approach, you can potentially grow your wealth and achieve your financial goals. Best of luck on your investment journey!

The Steel Tariff reversed a strong (continuous) increase in export sales setting back steel sales by 10.8% The Aluminum tariff reverse caused a drop in sales of 3.9% These are seriously large drops in sales performance seriously impacting the producers and ultimately costing US consumers to pay more in construction material costs (as an example). The US imposed Tariffs put an extra 183 million dollars per month in the US duty collectors pocket during the tariff increase that was passed along to consumers (ultimately). What bothers me is the ease at which the president did it. This should be really of a concern to everyone in Canada. Trump displayed a complete lack of global economics and treated one of the USA’s biggest trading partners like a “less than” or unimportant x-partner. He was ready to economically damage Canadian Trade relations and the economy just to appease his political base. Be the “Big Man”. The result is now, at a fundamental level, Canadians no longer trust America. I see the USMCA (reboot of NAFTA) as something that is probably not worth the paper that it is printed on. If the President can invoke “War Measures” act to impose any tariff that he desires as a “punitive” measure then I think that Canada should be trying very very hard to find other trading partners to work with. Trading partners that value a relationship with Canada because the USA clearly does not.

LAND: An asset that does not depreciate over time.- For me, this is the safest bet for money investment and wealth creation in medium to long term to double your money or even much more. Infact, there is no limit to it.- However, this usually requires some good amount of research, field work, time consuming and legal work. Also, this is largely dependent on market valuation and has no fixed formula to evaluate.- Land sold within 3 years attracts a Short Term Capital Gain tax of 20% on profit, while 10% tax when sold after 3 years.- There are many websites now available which deal in real estate and plots buy/sell. One should purchase land/plots only from reputed dealers/companies and verify the legal documents from a legal expert.- A plot in the outskirts or along the highways/by pass roads, are good prospects and cheaper too. While any plot within the city would be already costly and might not appreciate further at a good rate.2. STOCKS or SHARES or EQUITIES: Probably the quickest way to grow wealth.- Investing in Stock Market is nothing but investing in the Company business and becoming its shareholder.- This is one of the easiest ways of investing money with a click of mouse using Demat Account. Totally transparent, hassle free and paperless process of transaction.- Biggest benefit is the profit is completely tax free if the investment is held for more than a year. Even the short term profit (Shares sold within a year) attracts only 15% STCG tax flat.- It can double your money in few years, months and even weeks.- A good company would also declare dividends (tax free) regularly and can issue share splits and bonuses which can increase your invested worth exponentially.- Also, every day one can get multiple opportunities to make profits via intraday trading as well.- Equity linked Mutual Funds, ULIPs, ELSS etc. are indirect ways of investing in the Share Market which can give you handsome returns if chosen wisely.- However, investing in Equities directly or through Mutual Funds is completely subject to market risks and hence requires at least some basic strategy mitigate risks. DEBT: This is the least risky investment option however cannot help your money grow at a fast pace. PPF (Public Provident Fund): One of the best debt investment options in long run. Not only Completely Tax Free but also a tax Saving investment under Section 80C. Money is locked for initial 7 years and cannot invest more than Rs. 1.5Lacs per year. However, serves as the best and safest wealth creation vehicle over years. After the maturity of 15 years, PPF can be renewed for another block of 5 years indefinitely. Fixed Deposits (FD): These are usually taxable and money is locked for the specific duration. It also usually attracts penalty if the money is withdrawn pre-maturely. Post Office Schemes: Like NSC, KVP, RD etc. However, the interest rates are not that high. Indian Post Offices are yet to catch up the online age, so not so favorite. ULIPs (Unit Linked Insurance Plan) are good SIPs (Systematic Investment Plan):- Firstly its a Life Insurance Plan, the premium of which is invested in equity market, Hence, the return is never fixed and may be even negative if market has not performed well over the years of investment. Secondly, SIPs invest your money periodically (fixed dates) in the market irrespective of whether the market is at high or low. However, to reap best returns, the money should ideally be invested only when the market or share price is trading lower.

I was very excited at that time because I liked k-pop and was curious about how the students were studying there. Maybe my experience can help :D We left in the fall. The first impression is that the airport atmosphere is ordinary, quiet, not like the atmosphere when idols are welcomed home, which is so crowded that there is a photographer. Exiting the airport immediately felt really cold. I have never been to a cold country. Haha I was surprised when I first met my partner and her friends. Their make up is pretty thickSomething like this, but not all this 'natural'. Some have whiter faces than their necks, some have very red lipstick, wear eyeliner, and many use patches to cover their pimples. When I'm talking, I like to watch and think why the makeup is so thick plus the patch is a little strange in my eyes because no one in my house has worn it. I don't dare to ask the reason for wearing that thick makeup because I think it's impolite.Regarding the appearance of the students there, the girls are beautiful and tall, I don't pay much attention to the boys because I'm afraid (don't know why) but among Korean students who take student exchanges, the average is average, but 2-3 people are handsome and seem no plastic surgery, I don't know, I can't tell the difference :D. The height of the boys also varies, not all are tall, but some are very tall. The way they wear uniforms is also different. There are those who wear skirts and training pants at the same time and there are men who wear shirts that are not buttoned with them. Overall, South Korean students are like their TV dramas.Get ready for school at 06.00, 07.00Breakfast with small portions, actually I have a lot of appetite but at times I feel uncomfortable because they eat small portions, even though the food is delicious and I don't know why while I was there I was always served cold water.They don't shower in the morning, only wash their hair because they had bathed the night before (seems everyone already knows this)Most student families live in apartments and in car parks.I rarely see my partner's father at home in the morning, her mother often takes us to school.They are very cold. I, who already wore layered clothes and jackets, were still cold, but they only had short skirts, stockings, and jackets that looked comfortable.When we arrived, South Korean students came home early from school to accompany us to places of interest. I thought going home early meant it was noon but it was 06.00 PM. They just got home at that hour, they looked very happy. I can't imagine another student coming home later that night.If you want to enter the school building, you have to take off your shoes and replace them with sandals (I don't know if this is only done in certain seasons or not). So they each have their own slippers left at school.In my opinion, because they are more often at school, when they are outside of school they seem to want to be free. We were taken to places of entertainment such as bowling, billiards, karaoke. I personally want to go to a quiet place, but I can't protest either. Finally, I just enjoy it.My partner's family and friends are very kind. When we were at home, we were served Korean snacks such as Korean pancakes and when they greeted us, my friend's partner's father greeted us in another language, it was so funny that he used a translation with his voice.When they come home from school, they are rarely picked up. We sometimes take a taxi or bus home (if we take the bus, we are very tired because we have to walk again and in my opinion it is quite far but the good thing is that after that I am stronger than my other friends in my home country :D)Still about the points above, on the bus when it's crowded it feels very stuffy and the bus driver often wants to fall from his seatBecause I like to hear scary stories on the bus, I always cover my ass just in case.When I was on the bus, I often smelled a peculiar smell. Cannot be described.I've been seen by skinny men and he smiled so creepy that I was nervous. At first I thought maybe it wasn't me that he saw but after many times I looked at the father, he still had the same smile and kept looking at me. Luckily, it wasn't long before he came down. N-TThe tteokbokki there is very different from the one in my city. It's more delicious and tastes very very different.Every time I eat, there is always kimchi.Schools in South Korea are very large. At the school we attended, the boys' and girls' classes were separated. In these classes, it is very normal for students to wear hair rollers, blankets, mirrors, etc. when the teacher teaches.When at the coffee shop, Korean students don't like to talk or joke until their voices are loud.Walking in the middle of the night is normal for them.The toilet has a lot of weird buttons. I'm so confused just to flush :(I've been to a public toilet in a dining area and the inside door has used sanitary napkins on it. Oh man, it's the first time I've seen something like that… you can imagine how disgusted I wasThere was a Korean student who joined our activity and came late—we were playing billiards at the time—I didn't notice it at first, but my friend said that the Korean student's neck had red marks :D I thought maybe it was because it was night, mosquito bites. If it's true as expected, that's the first time I've seen T.T's hickey marks and it's weird...They—Korean students—are very good at taking photos. Actually there are many more but it will be very long. The school is not in Seoul. So, I don't know if in Seoul the student life is the same or not. I think you can draw your own conclusions about student life in Korea.

This resulted in his being afflicted with Cerebral Palsy which left Richard almost completely immobile and required care for the remainder of his life. Against the orders of doctors his father Rick chose to keep him at home and give him the best life he could. When Richard was 15 he asked his dad, Rick, if they could do a race to raise money for charity for an injured athlete from his school. He pushed his son in his chair for the entire race. His son ended up loving it, saying that while they raced he felt like he could walk for once in his life, that he felt alive. That was all that his father needed to hear. This began a long tradition of running races: Which included triathalons, in which Rick would put his son in a raft and pull him: Carrying him to different vehicles for transport. They have formed a legendary partnership that includes hundreds of races and 72 marathons. There is now a statue of the two in Boston: His father’s dedication to raising money and awareness for Cerebral Palsy, and above all, his dedication to bringing happiness to his son's life has always moved me.

So the prime minister gives him a list of knighthoods and he automatically approves it. Knights do not have to be citizens, but some countries frown on their citizens accepting honours from foreign countries, so the UK giving honours to non-citizens is relatively rare (eg., Amercian general Norman Schwartzkopf was given a knighthood for his role in commanding Operation Desert Storm). That being said, there are some orders of knighthood that are reserved for personal service to the king, and the king has discretion over who gets them. The government could in theory object to a knighthood being given to the king’s servants and advisors, but they will try to avoid interfering with that if at all possible."},{"prompt":"without using mathematical induction?","completion":"I can prove the statement by factorisation as below.

The 5 factors of the product leaves different remainders when divided by 5. One of their remainders must be zero and hence divisible by 5. Also when divided by 4, at least one of the remainders must be also zero and hence divisible by 4. Therefore [math] n^{5} - 5n^{3} + 4n [/math]is divisible by 20.

So, i’ll list out some of the known and unknown facts one by one: Telugu language is a Dravidian language which ranks 3rd by the number of native speakers in India.‘Telugu’ might also be a reference to physical characteristics of the people who once lived there. Etymology: Andhra Bhasha — the language of the Andhras is known as Telugu, or Tenugu (tene/the-n = honey, agu = is), meaning, sweet as honey. The speakers of the language call it \\"Telugu\\". The older forms of the name include Teluṅgu, Tenuṅgu and Teliṅga. The etymology of Telugu is not certain. Some historical scholars have suggested a derivation from Sanskrit triliṅgam, as in Trilinga Desa, \\"the country of the three lingas\\". Another view holds that tenugu is derived from the Tamil and Kannada word ten– \\"south\\" to mean \\"the people who lived in the south/southern direction\\" in relation to the Indo-Aryan empires. But this etymology sounds absurd and meaningless, and the word “th-e’N” (not te-n) means Honey in Tamil; So this is the most correct etymology.Early Epigraphy: Prakrit Inscriptions with some Telugu words dating back to 400 BC to 100 BC have been discovered in Bhattiprolu in the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh. The English translation of one inscription reads, \\"gift of the slab by venerable Midikilayakha\\". This recent discovered inscriptions dating around 400–100 BCE actually was not a Telugu inscription. Dated between 200 BCE - 200 CE, a Prakrit work called Gāthā Saptaśatī written by Sathavahana King Hala, Telugu words like అత్త, వాలుంకి, పీలుఅ, పోట్టం, కిలించిఅః, అద్దాఏ, భోండీ, సరఅస్స, తుప్ప, ఫలహీ, వేంట, రుంప-రంప, మడహసరిఆ, వోడసుణఓ, సాఉలీ and తీరఏ have been used. The first inscription entirely in Telugu was made in 575 AD and was probably made by Renati Cholas, who started writing royal proclamations in Telugu instead of Sanskrit or Prakrits. Telugu developed as a poetical and literary language during the 11th century. This first written materials in the Telugu date from 575 AD and its script is derived from that of the 4th-century AD Chalukya dynasty and is related to that of the Kannada language. Telugu literature begins in the 11th century AD with a version of the Indian epic Mahabharata by the writer Nannaya. According to the famous Japanese Historian [LINKED_TEXT: Noboru Karashima] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noboru_Karashima] who once served as the President of the Epigraphical Society of India in 1985 calculated that there are approximately 10,000+ inscriptions which exist in the Telugu language as of the year 1996 making it one of the most densely inscribed languages. Telugu inscriptions are found in all the districts of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. They are also found in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and other states in India. Bhujang Chenchiah [LINKED_TEXT: A History of Telugu Literature] [URL: https://books.google.co.in/books?id=xwXx7LB-ai4C&pg=PA17], Asian Educational Services, 1988 [Ref. [LINKED_TEXT: Telugu language - Wikiquote] [URL: https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Telugu_language]]: “The view, maintained by all Telugu grammarians and Sanskrit Philogists, that Telugu is Vikriti — that is, a language formed by the modification of Sanskrit and Prakrit. An analysis of the language as it has ...been for centuries confirms this traditional view....” But the information does not enable to say whether they used Telugu in any form. It is probable that they spoke a form of Prakrit, from which Telugu has descended. Vikriti is the Proto-Telugu/Pre-Telugu spoken around 600 BCE–100 CE.Telugu was more influenced by Sanskrit and Prakrit during this period, which corresponded to the advent of Telugu literature. Because of the continuous political dynamic empires like Mauryan, Satavanna and Pallavas have influenced their Prakrit, Sanskrit and Old Tamil on Vikriti, thus OLD TELUGU was completely formed well around 3rd century AD.Although many Sanskrit words are used in Telugu, yet the language has not its origin in Sanskrit.Pure Telugu is formed from roots, which have a close connection with the roots of the other languages of South India, e.g., Tamil, Kannada, etc.The Vijayanagar Empire gained dominance from 1336 to the late 17th century, reaching its peak during the rule of Krishnadevaraya in the 16th century, when Telugu literature experienced what is considered its Golden Age. The bulk of Telugu literature belongs to the 14th and subsequent centuries. In the beginning of the 16th century the court of King Krishnadevaraya of Vijayanagar was famous for its learning, and various branches of literature were eagerly cultivated. The poet Vemana is supposed by some authorities to have lived during the 16th century.The Telugu Grammar is called vyākaranam (వ్యాకరణం). The first treatise on Telugu grammar, the Āndhra Śabda Cinṭāmaṇi, was written in Sanskrit by Nannayya, considered the first Telugu poet and translator, in the 11th century AD. Every Telugu grammatical rule is derived from Pāṇinian concepts.Sanskrit influenced Telugu of Andhra and Telangana regions for about 1500 years; however, there is evidence that suggests an older influence. During the period 1000–1100 AD, Nannaya's re-writing of the Mahābhārata in Telugu (మహాభారతము) re-established its use, and it dominated over the royal language, Sanskrit. Telugu absorbed tatsamas from Sanskrit.Modern Telugu vocabulary can be said to constitute a diglossia because the formal, standardised version of the language is either lexically Sanskrit or heavily influenced by Sanskrit, is taught in schools, and is used by the government and Hindu religious institutions.Everyday Telugu varies depending upon region and social status. The Telugu language, like many others, may be viewed as consisting of three branches, namely— (1) The language of common conversation, (2) The language of prose books, and (3) The language of Poetry. Each of these three branches differs not only in the choice of words, but also in grammatical forms of the same words.Telugu words end in vowels which many consider a mellifluous quality and thus suitable for musical expression. So most songs (Kirtanas) are in Kannada and Telugu, specifically ! Historicity of Telugu language: Among the four major Dravidian Languages, Tamil and Telugu had independent Origins: [LINKED_TEXT: History and Development of the four Major Dravidian Languages] [URL: https://languages361.quora.com/History-and-Development-of-the-four-Major-Dravidian-Languages]Bhujang Chenchiah [LINKED_TEXT: A History of Telugu Literature] [URL: https://books.google.co.in/books?id=xwXx7LB-ai4C&pg=PA17], Asian Educational Services, 1988: ...the view, maintained by all Telugu grammarians and Sanskrit philologists, that Telugu is Vikriti — that is, a language formed by the modification of Sanskrit and Prakrit. An analysis of the language as it has ...been for centuries confirms this traditional view....But the information does not enable to say whether they used Telugu in any form. It is probable that they spoke a form of Prakrit, from which Telugu has descended. (Page-16)Steever, Sanford B. (1998), \\"Introduction to the Dravidian Languages\\", in Steever, Sanford B., The Dravidian Languages, Routledge, pp. 1–39 explains clearly why Telugu was a Prakrit in its initial phase. Even Proto-Telugu (Vikriti) is supposed to be more ancient than Magadhi prakrit. Is Telugu, a Dravidian or Indo-aryan language ? Telugu language in its initial phase Proto-Telugu (Vikriti) was spoken in Asaka Jannapadha. And around 400 BCE after the fall of Asaka Jannaphada, Andhra empire was established under Satavannas (vassals of Mauryan Empire) who spoke Maharastri Prakrit. And after the fall of Mauryan empire, Satavannas are well known for having established trade links with north and south. They’re credited for establishing the vedic culture to the South. During these phases of History, Vikriti and other Prakrits influence over Dravidian languages gave Telugu, a high balanced Dravidian and Indo-aryan substratum. That is the reason why Telugu is still debated about its linguistic family identity. Telugu may be a Dravida bhasha or Arya bhasha (neither dravidian nor indo-aryan, but never anyone). Linguistically, Telugu is said to split from Proto-Dravidian at first. I would say Tamil is both phonologically and morphologically more close to Proto-Dravidian while, Telugu is morphologically closer to Proto-Dravidian. In terms of number of contrasting sounds, Tamil retains a considerable amount of Proto-Dravidian cognates and phonological system, while Telugu retains Proto-Dravidian gender system alone. Because of these similarities in morphological features, Telugu is often confused to be emerged from Tamil. But anyway Historical Linguistics says that Telugu in its initial phase was Prakrit which in due course of time evolved as a Dravida bhasha. That is the reason why early Epigraphic records found in Telangana and Andra are in Prakrit. Telugu is a continuation of Prakrit, during its historic phases unlike Tamil country, Telugu land suffered from Numerous invasions. Because of all these, Telugu language got distanced away from its Prakritic legacy. Other Dravidian languages may also have influenced Telugu language during its historic phases. Vedic basha → Vikriti basha (Pre-Proto-Telugu)→ Maharastri prakrit (Proto-Telugu) → Old Telugu → Middle Telugu → Modern Telugu.

Other Facts: Telugu is one of the six classical languages of India.Telugu has kept certain unique Sanskrit features, especially in the pronunciation of some vowels and consonants, that have subsequently been lost in some of Sanskrit’s daughter languages, including Hindi and Bengali.Telugu is ranked 7th in Asia and 14th in the world based on its total number of speakers.The only Indian language where every word ends in Vowel, so it is also called as ‘Ajanta Bhaasha’ and is called “The Italian of the East” by Niccola da Conti, a 16th century Venetian traveler.Telugu language is the 2nd heavily Sanskritized (close to 60%) Dravidian language next to Malayalam.Language of literary Telugu (Grandhika or Sampradayika) is very refined from its spoken form.Historically, the period from 11th to 16th century is known as ‘The Golden age of Telugu literature’.Emperor Krishnadevaraya himself was a Great Telugu scholar. He is the author of ‘Amuktamalyada’, one of the best Pancha Kavyas or five classic works.Telugu is an inflected language (modifying root words for case, number, and tense). And Telugu has 3 genders: Male, Female and Neuter.Telugu language has a general S-O-V order.Telugu pronouns include personal pronouns, indefinite pronouns, relative pronouns and reciprocal or reflexive pronouns.Telugu language is written from left to right ( → ) and consists of sequences of simple and/or complex characters.The Telugu script consists of 60 symbols – 16 vowels, 3 vowel modifiers, and 41 consonants. Telugu has a complete set of letters that follow a system to express sounds.Telugu languages vowels are called as ‘Acchulu’ (swaram) and its consonants are called as ‘Hallulu’ (vyanjanam). //Sounds wow…!//Telugu Writing is highly influenced by Kannada writing system except some letters. The Telugu script is derived from that of the 6th-century Chalukya dynasty and is related to that of the Kannada language.In Carnatic music, a vast majority of compositions - Kirtanas, Varnams, Padams, Javalis, Thillanas - are in Telugu only.The Telugu language has been known under several different denominations. The first name which meets us is Andhra, under which denomination it is mentioned by the Chinese pilgrim Huen Tsang who visited India in the 7th century A.D. He tells us that the Andhras had a language of their own, written in an alphabet which did not much differ from those used in Northern India, The well known Indian author Kumarila Bhatta mentions the Aandhra-Dravida-bhasha.

So, basically you get your gift halfway through Christmas dinner but just stare at it as you finish the second half of your meal. It’s weird but we do it and it’s kind of fun to see how the kids with impatient for their gift. It does something as it makes the kids more patient as they grow into an adult. It definitely helps me in my adult years with impulsivities and instant gratification. Anyways, 4 years ago, a family friend that we invited to dinner (because why not) legitimately gave my cousin (who married without kids) a pack of condoms “for good luck”. It really shook me. When we opened it after dinner, he just opened a box of trojans slim fit skyn. She gave it to him with the straightest face and said, “get to work, good luck”. I don’t know if I consider as much strange as unnecessarily out of place and perhaps disrespectful. Needless to say, we never invited the aforementioned person to family dinner again although we are now distant family-friends. Like, why would you do that, I don’t know why a person would.

This can vary wildly depending on the copyright holder. Most cartoons, both western cartoons and anime tend to follow trends by the decade, these traits seen in multiple works are usually going to be considered \\"stock assets\\" and non copyrightable. So look for decade wide trends. Issues come in when someone heavily draws from an art style not seen elsewhere, as if other large companies aren't copying parts of it, it's definitely dangerous ground for an individual. Ever wonder why nobody draws and sells stuff in Dr Seuss' style? But multiple people seem to have an art style in their commercial portfolio similar to Jhonen Vasquez? It's probably because one is generally safe to use and draw influence from and the other isn't. It's not letting me see the comment (stupid app), so I don't know which work specifically by Hasbro you're influenced by- but I'd say if it's one such as Friendship is Magic or Transformers- don't bother, that's dangerous territory. You're asking for legal trouble since the style is dependent on the design and worldbuilding of the characters (in these cases them being cute ponies/vehicle-humanoid robots in universes revolving around such beings). At best you'll be scoffed as a knockoff and at worst you'll get a cease and desist. Or, you could do what D&D (owned by wizards of the coast and therefore Hasbro) did and do the halfling/Hobbit thing, but that is an issue of its own, and it even cost Hasbro a lawsuit in the beginning. Also do be noted that a style of drawing is *NOT* copyrightable as is a specific book, character, setting, film, or image. However of course, one can be sued for anything and large companies have an advantage (money, resources and money) over individuals. So you'll get sued if someone gets angry anyway. And if someone does sue you, an individual, even if you're fully in the right and win you'll have lost lots of money and time that could be spent advertising and selling your product.

But in 2016, Kaepernick ignited a firestorm of controversy when—as a protest against ongoing police brutality and racial injustice in the US—he chose to take a knee during the performance of the US National Anthem prior to pro football games. Criticized by then-candidate Trump, ostracized by Fox News and conservative pundits, and blackballed by the team owners, Kaepernick’s talents were not enough to get him contracts for the ensuing years, at times when players with far inferior records were getting signed. As of this writing, Kaepernick has sacrificed two of his prime playing years for his beliefs, in a sport where the average quarterback plays only 3.3 years (according to the NFL Players Association).

Maybe, it could be favourable for her and her fake and blind supporters. As a Chief Minister, she has been an utter failure.

Even after her demise, her party (ADMK) is only a functionless body with MLAs who are now looking for another Master (Mr. Mo) who will keep them as slaves of money- just like how Jayalalitha maintained them. BJP wouldn’t have had any voice in Tamil Nadu if any other party, say DMK, had been in the governance. Jayalalitha is the major reason for the existing sickening plight of the people and the state of Tamil Nadu. Many issues are still left unaddressed which include farmers issue, unemployment, water scarcity in delta region, private sector encroachment, misuse of power of bureaucracy, and the list gets bigger.

This is something similar. Whenever you try to access a website, you have to put in a request first. But that request exposes your public IP address that maybe you don’t want to do. It’s better to be safe and not expose your real IP address. This is where a Proxy server helps. When using a proxy server you would not access the website directly, but the proxy server will do it for you. Not just that it will also retrieve data for you. Is that all to a proxy server? No. There are many advantages to using a proxy server. These advantages include: Privacy: This is self-explanatory as to why it favours privacy.Speed: The proxy server may have Cached Web Database.Saves Bandwidth: Not retrieving the data from the original server would save bandwidth.Activity logging: Setting up your proxy server would help keep track of the websites visited. This allows you to have control over your activity. Many proxy servers are available for you to use. Here are my recommendations for [LINKED_TEXT: Best Proxy Servers] [URL: https://www.bestprivacyvpn.com/free-proxy/]: Kproxy: No registration required for this one so you can start using this service now. It does not serve you additional ads.HideMyAss: If you prefer speed, this is the service you should choose.Proxy Site: It asks you to control the cookie, javascript, ads, and objects on the browser, If you enjoy being in control this is the service you should go for. Using a proxy server is a great start but, You should note that it does not encrypt any data. Anyone with means can intercept the data that is being transferred between servers. That’s where a VPN comes into play. A virtual private network will not only act as an intermediatory, It will actively encrypt your data. It is like making a tunnel between you and the server. But not all VPNs share the goodwill. You have to look for [LINKED_TEXT: Best Privacy VPNs] [URL: https://www.bestprivacyvpn.com/] to make yourself more secure on the internet.

Women have been having babies for thousands of years. It's the most important part of nature. Animals have pregnancy and give birth. So why are you guys acting like it's an unnatural thing to have a baby? Our bodies are designed for this stuff. We’re physically and mentally and spiritually designed for procreation. And we're not supposed to be sliced and cut up like the way they do. That's the hospitals and doctors making birth so unnatural. Not mother nature. So why is it that hundreds and thousands of women are being told that their bodies can't handle having a baby? Do you think doctors tell you the whole truth about your baby and your health? Not always. Doctors will ask anyone to have an abortion. They asked my mom and there was nothing wrong with all 5 of her children. And this was back in the 70’s and 80’s. If doctors really want to, they will lie about the wellbeing of mother and child to get an abortion procedure. But that doesn't mean that these health risks is true for all the thousands and millions of women in the world. A couple hundred women maybe but… Millions?? 🤔 There's so many stories and comments of women online who talk about their pregnancies and how the doctor told them that if they didn't terminate the pregnancy, their lives would be at risk and the baby will die anyway. Or will be a vegetable or have something wrong with them. Only to have normal, healthy babies. With healthy normal lives. That's happened A lot. Abortion rights, women's rights.have been pounded and ingrained into people's minds for 50 years. So yes, of course men (and just about any person on the planet) will agree with the women. It's their bodies. Their rights. But with that said, it's funny how, when a mother abandons, or kills her newborn, or 2 month old baby, or 1 year old child. Why is she a monster? A murderer. A horrible woman. But not a real mother. What if she tried to have an abortion and her father, boyfriend, rapist, etc. Wouldn't let her? Why is she so horrible then? That baby was her right. Part of her body. Can someone please explain the difference?"},{"prompt":"What will happen if 1 will be equal to 1 rupee? What will be the consequences?","completion":"If 1 USD=1 INR, result=Everyone Dies™ (in a way) Let's get one misconception out of the way: the strength of a currency relative to other currencies does not determine the health of that country's economy. If that were the case, Oman should be eclipsing the US and China as the most dominant economic force on the planet: that is, of course, not the case. With that out of the way, let's analyze what would happen to the Indian economy if the IN₹ matched the US in value. First off, as would be obvious, India's IT sector, which relies on inexpensive yet skilled labor would instantaneously collapse, leaving hundreds of thousands of people, if not millions, out of a job. No job=no income, and India doesn't really have an extensive and strong safety net that other Western welfare states have, leaving many professionals almost penniless. As with the IT industry, other Indian exporters would also be completely unable to sell their products because of the loss of their competitive edge. But wait, that's not all! Due to the existence of what's known as the multiplier effect in economies, wherein effects of a particular decision can snowball into other sectors and produce effects on the entire economy, i.e. the decision's effects get multiplied throughout the economy. When all of the above takes place, people see a huge loss in demand, as so many people simply lose their disposable incomes, and are left with little money to spare. Businesses, having gone down under and shutting, lead their clients to suffer, and their creditors looking for ways to get their money back, and when they find that they can't, they also go bankrupt. They lose any purchasing power. But let's leave all these guys out of the picture for now, and focus on day-to-day aspects, that would concern most of us. Let's say that lots of us are able to survive on savings somehow. We find that imports are suddenly a lot cheaper than they used to be, especially American ones. American products get really inexpensive from an importing point of view, and we start buying American imports en masse. Whichever few Indian businesses would be left surviving would be driven to the point of extinction, even the ones that didn't rely on export income. Result: they shut shop too, and even more people lose their jobs. Now, we've spoken a lot about the Indian populace at large, but what about the government? Well, the government derives most of its revenues through taxes, and to an extent through the money earned from the public sector. When people find themselves without any money, all of the government's revenue streams dry up very quickly, and either they cut back their spending, or they start borrowing very heavily from other countries so that they can spend. If you're wondering which option is better, the answer is neither. Both options are absolutely terrible. If the government stops spending, literally everything and everybody suffers: defense (our neighbors would be quick to exploit this vulnerability), businesses that rely on subsidies, farmers, the common man, infrastructure companies, foreign multinationals seeking to expand into the country, banks, basically literally everyone. The other alternative? As torturous. We'd find ourselves in a position like Greece: unable to pay back the debt and interest, so we need to be bailed out by an organization like the IMF in return, most likely, for implementation of austerity reforms, crucifying the economy even further, killing incomes, and leading to a prolonged slump that would be extremely difficult indeed, to overcome. Therefore, if this happened, India would find itself in such a tough spot, that it would be extremely hard for it to climb out of. And, like I said before, Everyone Dies™."},{"prompt":"w many gun owners have actually stopped a crime from being committed by using a gun?","completion":"Roughly 3 million times annually.

It was first done during the Tetrarchy. To answer your question anyway: by this time, Rome was more than just a city. It was an empire. Everyone who had citizenship of this empire was a Roman. So, when Constantine moved the capital to Constantinople, he didn’t need to change the name of the empire to ‘The Constantinoplian Empire' or something like that. Constantinople was Rome, not as in part of the city, but part of the empire.

This phrase is often used to remind people that they should be open-minded and take the time to get to know someone or something before making a judgment. To illustrate this point, let's consider a case study. Imagine that you are in charge of hiring a new employee for your company. You receive two resumes from candidates who have similar qualifications and experience. However, one of the candidates has a more polished and professional-looking resume, while the other candidate's resume appears to be hastily put together and contains some typos. At first glance, you might be inclined to choose the candidate with the more impressive-looking resume. However, if you take the time to read through both resumes and conduct interviews with each candidate, you might discover that the candidate with the less polished resume is actually a better fit for the job. Perhaps this candidate has more relevant experience, better communication skills, or a better attitude. In this case, judging the candidates based solely on their resumes would be a mistake. By taking the time to get to know each candidate, you can make a more informed decision and choose the candidate who is truly the best fit for the job. This example shows that it is important to look beyond appearances and take the time to gather more information before making a judgment. By doing so, you can avoid making hasty decisions that may not be in your best interest."},{"prompt":"it safe to give cats raw eggs or parts of raw eggs?","completion":"I do know people that add an egg to the cats food once in awhile.

Equalization basins are a specialized process for the purpose of equalizing widely divergent flows. If a facility has normal diurnal flows (higher during the day and lower at night when people are mostly sleeping) then normal treatment processes can handle this. A plant like this doesn't really need equalization. On the other hand, if the flows to your facility increase dramatically and quickly, equalization is your best friend. For example, I worked at [LINKED_TEXT: Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay] [URL: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Submarine_Base_Kings_Bay?wprov=sfla1]. There were two treatment plants there, one for the main base and one for the waterfront. The waterfront plant treated waste almost entirely from submarines and ships. As long as the boats were moored to the pier, we got normal diurnal flows. But when boats first dock they flush their tanks into our system. Depending on the circumstances of their trip, they may pump a day's worth of sewage in an hour. If several boats come in on the same day, that's a lot of sewage. Like anything else, sewage plants can be good designs or can be poor designs. This plant was a poor design. But the equalization basin was its saving grace. The plant had virtually zero flow changes, not even the normal diurnal flows. Stability of flow through a treatment facility is very helpful especially for poor designs so this plant generally did okay. As you can see, equalization basins can be very helpful in some circumstances. Even so, in most cases they just aren't needed. Most treatment plants do just fine without one."},{"prompt":"Do expensive guitar pickups make a difference?","completion":"Yes, from a pure sonic perspective, the pickups are the most important component."},{"prompt":"w should I meet you?","completion":"I travel a lot; maybe I’ll bump into you sometime.

They use reverse psychology in most situations.. when people who would try to act according to the herd mentality they do reverse but for ur own benefit. 2. They come mostly from the unexpected ones. You may not find true friends during your good times but the worse. 3. True friends come up with epic ideas to surprise you and these events mostly have realistic life changing ideas. for example, they would want to make you a partner in growth but sometimes take responsibility for failure if u r not able to take it. i have explained these three features in an elaborated manner in the one min video. below.. if u like it kindly share and subscibe the channel as its an initiative to provide the life coaching quality content for many in the world all for free. thanks for ur time and effort [LINKED_TEXT: How to identify #truefriends 🔥 how to #trust people more | how to Identify #truelove | #peopleskillsIf i ask you who are your #truefriends you may not answer it accurately because you can never know about your true friends just like that.

I guess I would spend about 5 or 6 seconds thinking about it every two years. Unless I am thinking about the lunatics who are worried about it. First of all it should be rephrased human caused climate change. Climate change has always occurred. Let’s start with the basics. The world is going to end. The world is supposed to end. That is not a bad thing. It’s only a bad thing for people who do not believe in God. Pollution is bad, littering is bad. Clean water is good. We should try to protect the environment. What the lunatics really want in a round about way is they want to get rid of capitalism. Yes at its core these people want to regulate everything and end capitalism. It’s not going to happen. Don’t you love it when a country like Sweden makes a big deal about stopping climate change and global warming while China and India dont. There are about 2.8 billion people in China and India and 10 million in Sweden. There was an article about human resilience a while back. It talked about how people have adapted to the most extreme of circumstances. It talked about people living their daily lives during the Blitz in England in WW2. You know a period of time when bombs were being dropped on your neighborhood every day. Humans can adapt to many conditions. But guess what. If It’s Gods time to take us or end the world than it’s Gods time to take us and end the world."},{"prompt":"Why are Siberian Huskies abandoned in large quantities?","completion":"Does not make sense to me because they are cool dogs, unless it is because they have so much energy and like (need) to run so much? I never owned one, but I had a cool experience with a bunch of them. Many years ago when I had to go work in Alaska for a couple months and I paid the guy who came in second that year in the Iditarod race to let me drive his dog sled and team up the Iditarod trail. When I drove up the dogs were on chains staked to the ground and they were straining so hard to start running. He explained that the main job was to keep them from running too fast and tiring themselves out. He sat in the sled to tell me what to do. Having seen movies where the musher just napped as he drove, I thought I did not need to do much and let the dogs just go. Whenever they had to urinate or defecate he would yell “on the run, on the run” and they would go while running 25 mph and he would have to hold his hand up in front of his face as it was flying back at 25 mph. When the trail hit a frozen lake, the dogs knew to turn toward the red flags marking the continuation of the trial on the left side of the lake so they turned left so fast the sled tipped over and the owner went sliding across the ice so I had to figure out how to stop them. When he got back to the sled he said “I’ll take over driving now, you sit in the sled and take a ride.” Knowing about the “on the run” I said “no way, I am paying to drive not ride, you sit up there, I’ll pay better attention.” We went maybe 30 more miles before we were blocked by a huge dead moose spread across the trail. Soon two rangers on snow mobiles arrived and started chain sawing it into manageable chunks and then carrying the chunks out on their snow mobiles. They told me that in the Spring (which it was then) when the moose have their babies, moose get very hostile when they see wolves and will charge the wolves and sometimes they find five or six wolves with parts of their heads sliced off. They said the moose half razor sharp edges on their hooves to cut through the ice to get to grass etc to eat, and when they swing their hooves out at wolves, if they catch the wolf’s head, it will just slice right through it. They explained when the moose see a dog team they think it is wolves and they charge. The dog team owners eat and sleep with their dogs and think of them like their kids, so when the moose charges, the owner has to shoot the moose. They then report the kill to the rangers who then remove the moose."},{"prompt":"the Indian economy in a real crisis?","completion":"The Indian economy has been low since last five quarters and will continue , in coming couple of quarters or more. The major factor of the slowdown is decrease in demand. It can be seen in various sectors either automobile,food industry,real estate etc. The Indian population has around 75% rural indians. The demonitization and heckling implementation of GST, lead to shutdown of many small scale businesses.Small sector units mainly have labour force from rural areas. eventually, after these events the most of the rural indian people became unemployed. If these people do not have money to spend except on their basic necessities, then how the demand going to increase. The demand and supply go hand in hand , there should be a proper balance of the same. The rural people needs to be empowered in order to increase the demands. Small sector units needs to be revived. GST process needs to be made simpler. These are some of the structural reform that are needed to be done. Other structral reforms, Export is currently at 2.2% ,can be stretched upto 3% by facilitating the process.The foreign investment could be brought in by taking the confidence of investor. Reduction in corporate taxes is a great step.Women labour force decreased by 10% , last year from 33.4% to 22%. By waiving the income tax for working women for a period of 10–15 yrs could solve the above problem.MNREGA needs to be re- established ,re-indexed in order to empower rural people. The above steps are given by taking the consideration of rural people, which really are important factor in determining the GDP.

Proxy is divided into forward proxy and reverse proxy. We usually use forward proxy, which allows a network terminal (usually a client) to connect indirectly to another network terminal (usually a server) through it. Proxy can be divided into HTTP, HTTP over TLS (HTTPS), Socks, Socks over TLS according to the protocol. Their operation principle is to allow users to send data to a proxy server (Proxy Server) first, then the proxy server forwards it to the destination server, achieving the purpose of anonymous access. Using a proxy does not require the installation of a specific client. You can set the proxy address and port directly in the browser or app to create a connection to the proxy server. After the connection is successful, the proxy server will use the proxy protocol to send a connection request to the target network address or server resource. Although you can hide the user's real IP address through using a proxy, due to the difference in the type and protocol of the proxy used, your behavior data will not be encrypted and protected, but will also be saved as a log by the proxy service provider, which has a high potential security risk. Some agency service providers would also display their own advertisements, which adversely impacts the user experience."},{"prompt":"Which 10 things should we stay away from in life?","completion":"Here are some things that are generally considered to be unwise or harmful in life: Procrastination: Putting off tasks or avoiding responsibilities can lead to stress, decreased productivity, and missed opportunities.Negative self-talk: Constantly criticizing yourself or engaging in negative self-talk can lead to low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression.Substance abuse: Using drugs or alcohol to cope with problems or as a form of recreation can lead to physical and mental health problems, as well as relationship difficulties and financial difficulties.Avoiding personal growth: Refusing to challenge yourself or learn new things can lead to stagnation and a lack of fulfillment in life.Ignoring physical health: Neglecting exercise, sleep, or a healthy diet can have a negative impact on your physical and mental well-being.Toxic relationships: Surrounding yourself with people who are emotionally or physically harmful can be damaging to your mental and physical health, as well as your self-esteem.Procrastinating important tasks: Putting off important tasks such as paying bills, scheduling medical appointments, or completing work projects can have negative consequences.

However, here are some general tips that may help alleviate lower back pain: 1. Rest and Activity Modification: While rest is important during the acute phase of pain, prolonged bed rest is generally not recommended. Instead, try to stay active within your pain limits. Modify your activities and avoid excessive bending, lifting, or twisting that may strain your back. 2. Apply Heat or Cold: Applying heat or cold therapy to the affected area can provide temporary relief. Experiment with heat packs, warm showers, or hot water bottles for muscle relaxation. Alternatively, try ice packs or cold compresses to reduce inflammation. Choose the option that feels most soothing for you. 3. Over-the-Counter Pain Relief: Non-prescription pain medications such as acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can help alleviate pain and reduce inflammation. However, consult with a healthcare professional before taking any medication, especially if you have other health conditions or are taking other medications. 4. Gentle Stretching and Exercise: Engage in gentle stretching exercises that target the muscles of the lower back, hips, and hamstrings. Consult with a physical therapist or healthcare professional for appropriate exercises to improve flexibility and strengthen the supporting muscles in your back. 5. Maintain Good Posture: Practice good posture during daily activities to reduce strain on your lower back. Use ergonomic chairs, support cushions, or lumbar rolls to maintain proper spinal alignment while sitting. Avoid prolonged periods of slouching or sitting in one position. 6. Stress Reduction: Psychological and emotional stress can contribute to back pain. Engage in stress-reducing activities such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, or hobbies that help you relax and unwind. 7. Seek Professional Help: If your lower back pain persists or worsens despite self-care measures, it's advisable to seek professional help. Consult with a healthcare professional, such as a physician or physical therapist, who can evaluate your specific condition, provide a proper diagnosis, and recommend appropriate treatment options. Remember, these are general tips and may not address the specific cause of your lower back pain. It's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized evaluation and treatment plan."},{"prompt":"Why am I always rejected by the men I am interested in?","completion":"We are always attracted to those who are more attractive than ourselves.

The auto maker bailouts come to mind. Obama broke federal laws in those bailouts, shafting SECURED CREDITORS while giving control of the company to unions. GM recently bragged about their loan being fully paid off early, but didn’t mention the face that they used other free money from the government to do so. b) If you are referred to PPP loans, those were to bail out businesses that were in trouble because of covid government shutdowns. No fault of their own, and mostly the fault of government. c) Student loans were taken out VOLUNTARILY by people with the OBLIGATION to pay them back. If the student majored in a field that has no career path, like 15th Century African Gender Studies, that’s their own fault. Why should I, who paid my loans through military service, pay for their idiocy? If the concept of paying back a loan you freely took out is too complicated to understand, maybe you weren’t ready for college."},{"prompt":"w can I learn a dance? I have been trying, but I can't learn any dance. I mainly want to learn hip hop and Kpop dances.","completion":"1) Find a dance studio near you that has qualified teachers that know what they are doing. Starting at a good dance studio is very important as your basics and how you learn things will affect your future as a dancer. 2) Decide if you want to dance for fun or for competitions. This will determine how about how many classes you will take in a week and fees/tuition. Usually recreation classes only require you to take one or two classes a week. Competitive dancers usually take four, five, or six classes or one every day. All of this depends on your end goal, to get fit or have some fun or to win awards and scholarships. 3) Pick your dance genres. There are many dance genres to choose from. The most mainstream styles are ballet, contemporary, modern, lyrical, jazz, tap, and acro. Research about these genres and see which one you want to take. I would definitely recommend some form of ballet as ballet is a basis for all dance genres. Once you pick your genres then choose your classes. Call your studio to find classes that fit your genre(s) and time. Most studios have a free class you can take or a free trial week so you can make sure of your decisions before paying. 4) What to wear. Once you’ve paid your fees, you’re almost ready to dance. Now what do you wear to dance classes? Always make sure you are within your studios dress code if there is one! Ballet- Leotard and tights with ballet slippers of you or your studios choice. Contemporary/Modern/Lyrical- Anything that is relatively form fitting and comfortable to dance in. For shoes, dance socks, half soles/turners, foot undies, anything that your feel comfortable to dance in. Tap- your studio might give you a specific tap show to buy or you can choose for yourself. Clothing varies. Jazz- jazz shoes/ turners and clothing may vary. Make sure your hair is away from your face so you can dance comfortably and pull your hair into a bun in ballet for a clean look. Lastly, always remember to have fun! The last thing you want is too be to stiff. Don’t be afraid to express yourself through your movements."},{"prompt":"f the Avengers Hulk fought King Kong, who would win?","completion":"Hulk, easily. Here’s why… King Kong is simply a gigantic gorilla, so his strength is that of a 100 foot gorilla, or however tall he is. If he’s 100 feet tall, then he’s about 20 times the size of a real gorilla. Real gorilla’s are roughly ten times stronger than humans, putting 100 foot Kong at about 2,000 times stronger than a human. If we’re generous, and use the world-record bench press of 1,075 pounds as our human strength starting point, that would mean King Kong could bench 1,075 x 10 x 20, which equals 215,000 pounds, or 107 tons. Hulk’s STARTING strength, when he first “Hulks up,” is about 100 tons or more. So when the fight starts, King Kong will be about equal in strength with the Hulk. Then, as Kong hits him, and pisses him off more, Hulk gets bigger and stronger, and pretty soon, he's throwing Kong around like a rag doll, and that’s with a really generous strength estimate for Kong. That estimate, that gorillas are 10 times stronger than humans, is probably not based on the strongest human who has ever lived. It is more likely based on normal humans. The average bench press for a normal man is about 135 pounds. That sounds low, but that’s likely due to a lot of guys grossly exaggerating how much they can bench. I have benched 210 a few times, and that was when I was at my strongest. Currently, I could probably put up like 170, and I am a fairly big guy, 5′11″ 225 lbs. If you know someone that can really bench like 300 or more, they are very strong. The 1,075 pound bench press world record is freakin insane lol. So, if gorillas are 10 times stronger than humans, and the human average has a 135 pound bench press, and Kong is 20 times stronger than gorillas, then Kong’s max bench is 135 x 10 x 20, which is 27,000 pounds, or 13.5 tons. Yikes, by that reckoning, Hulk would win in a nasty curb-stomp."},{"prompt":"The Mahabhar","completion":"Krishna was not only skilled in war strategy but he was also a mighty warrior. But let’s not include him as it would be a sin to compare him with the likes of Karna, Arjuna, Bhishma etc. Same goes for Lord Balaram. I will not include Lord Balaram in my answer as he was divine and an incarnation of Adishesha himself. Mahabharata had various warriors who were very powerful and strong and had some amazing feats to their name. Comparing the warriors or ranking the warriors has always been a matter of debate. Loads of answers get collapsed due to the disagreement of some blind fans. But still I would attempt to answer this question which already has 100 or more answers. All my points would be based on BORI CE but I will provide the footnotes from KMG as it’s easier to find and read. Let’s rank these warriors on the basis of their feats and records. (10). Ghatotkacha The mighty demon son of Bhima had innumerable feats to his name but his real prowess was shown on the 14th night.He created his own army of Rakshasas out of his illusions. Such was the valour of those rakshasas that they made the powerful Karna retreat and defeated them. Ghatotkacha roared like a lion and terrified by this, the elephants exuded urine. The men were extremely miserable. Once twilight has passed, the rakshasas become even more powerful on earth. In every direction, they brought down a shower of boulders. Iron wheels, catapults, lances, javelins, spears, shataghnis and battleaxes showered down incessantly. On seeing the fierce and terrible state in the field of battle, the kings, your sons and Karna were distressed and fled in different directions. He defeated Dronacharya various times.He overpowered Aswatthama in a fierce fight using his illusions.His Rakshasas were very powerful and were killed in a very fierce fight. Why is he not ranked a bit higher? He was defeated by Aswatthama various times. His rakshasas were killed by Aswatthama. He never overpowered Aswatthama except for instance.He could not get an upper hand over Karna until the very last moment. (9). Abhimanyu The powerful son of Arjuna is already known as the bravest warrior from Mahabharata due to his extraordinary feats on the 13th day of Kurukshetra War where he singlehandedly created havoc in the Chakravyuha made by Kuru Army.He defeated Duhshasana in archery battle and the latter fled away from the battlefield.He defeated Karna 5 times and overpowered him once on 13th day. He first defeated defeated Karna and his brother had to come for saving Karna. [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #btrAw] He defeats Karna then for the second time with the use of normal arrows and Karna fled away from the battlefield. He shattered that net of elephants, horses, chariots and infantry. The immensely illustrious Abhimanyu angrily routed them with his arrows. Karna was afflicted by Abhimanyu’s many arrows. He fled on swift horses and the array was shattered. [LINKED_TEXT: [2]] [URL: #dtIRi]Abhimanyu then killed six of Karna’s advisors in front of him after overpowering Karna in an archery duel. This incident occurred after the incident given below. Phalguna’s son once again pierced Karna in the ear with a barbed arrow. Angering him even more, he pierced him with fifty arrows. Radheya pierced the great warrior back in turn. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Covered with arrows all over his limbs, he looked extremely radiant. Extremely enraged, he caused Karna to be covered in blood. Covered with arrows and streaming blood, the brave Karna was also resplendent. Both of them were beautiful with arrows on their bodies, and blood flowed from their wounds. Those great-souled ones looked like flowering kimshukatrees. Subhadra’s son destroyed six of Karna’s advisers, who were brave and wonderful in the art of fighting, together with their horses, charioteers, standards and chariots. [LINKED_TEXT: [3]] [URL: #RmcLd]Abhimanyu even defeated Dronacharya, Aswatthama, Brihadbala, Kripacharya, Duryodhana, Karna, Kritavarman and Shakuni even though all these people attacked him in a group.[LINKED_TEXT: [4]] [URL: #gbgbA] Beholding them broken and routed, Drona and Drona's son, and Vrihadvala, and Kripa, and Duryodhana, and Karna, and Kritavarman, and Suvala's son (Sakuni), rushed in great wrath against the unvanquished son of Subhadra. Almost all these, O king, were beaten back by thy grandson. Abhimanyu was made chariotless. He was deprived of a bow fairly by Karna. He still managed to defeat or overpower Aswatthama with a mace.[LINKED_TEXT: [5]] [URL: #LuVHv] Why does the brave hero get 9th rank and not any higher rank? Abhimanyu faced various defeats in his life which cannot be ignored. He was defeated on 1st day itself by Bhishma, 12th day by Bhagadatta etc. 8). Bhagadatta He was probably the most powerful fighter who fought on the back of an elephant.He had almost defeated Ghatotkacha on 1st day of war itself.He was an important warrior for the Kurus and was very instrumental during Bhishma’s reign as General of Army.His Valour on the 12th day was amazing.His elephant had almost killed Bhima that day.He defeated a Group attack which had Abhimanyu and Bhima in it. Such was the power of his immensely powerful and infallible Vaishnavastra that Lord Krishna himself had to save Arjuna.[LINKED_TEXT: [6]] [URL: #Sqzab] There’s no need to prove that why he is at 8th. There are tons of better warriors than him. (7). Satyaki He is undoubtedly the most underrated warrior of Mahabharata.He had started creating havoc from the first day itself where he along with Abhimanyu managed to make Drona and Bhishma retreat.He defeated Shakuni various times in the war.Satyaki had defeated Bhishma in the war.He defeated Karna on the 12th day when he attacked Karna along with Arjuna, Bhima and Dhristadyumna. Karna was present with his brother so it was not a group attack. Then Bhima, jumping down from his own car, like a second Garuda, slew with his excellent sword five and ten combatants amongst those that supported Karna. Mounting once more on his car and taking up another bow, he pierced Karna with ten shafts and his charioteer and steeds with five. Dhrishtadyumna also taking up a sword and a bright shield; despatched Charmavarman and also Vrihatkshatra, the ruler of the Naishadhas. The Panchala prince then, mounting upon his own car and taking up another bow, pierced Karna with three and seventy shafts, and uttered a loud roar. Sini's grandson also, of splendour equal to that of Indra himself, taking up another bow pierced Suta's son with four and sixty shafts and roared like a lion. And cutting off Karna's bow with a couple of well-shot shafts, he once more pierced Karna on the arms and the chest with three arrows. The king Duryodhana, and Drona and Jayadratha, rescued Karna from the Satyaki-ocean, as the former was about to sink into it. [LINKED_TEXT: [7]] [URL: #XOvhB]His valour on the 14th day was just next to Arjuna on that day. He defeated everyone who came in his way and successfully penetrated the 3 complex vyuhas formed by Dronacharya.He defeated Dronacharya on the way whom even Arjuna avoided that day. Even Sanjaya cross-verified this fact just after this paragraph. Apart from this, he defeated Kritavarman, Jalasandha and almost every warrior who came in his way.Satyaki defeated Karna. Karna became very sad after being defeated and climbed upon Duryodhana’s chariot. Satyaki defeated Dushasana and various other brothers of Duryodhana and spared their lives for the sake of protecting Bhima’s vow.Satyaki defeated Aswatthama, Kritavarman and hundreds of other maharathas. Satyaki had various powerful and amazing deeds but these are enough to describe him. Even though, he is so powerful. Why is he placed at 7th rank? Satyaki was defeated various no. of times by Karna even though he defeated him twice or thrice.Karna defeated Satyaki 8 times in the Kurukshetra war itself. Such was Karna’s prowess that Satyaki couldn’t defeat him even though he attacked Karna in a group.Satyaki had a fair amount of defeats in his life. He was defeated by Jayadratha on day 13 as Jayadratha’s boon only included the 4 Pandavas.Other than these, I can’t recollect his defeats. You may tell me in the comments. (6). Bhishma Bhishma’s exploits as a warrior are well known. He had some amazing feats in his life but the problem is that they were overshadowed by his fair amounts of defeats in his latter life.Bhishma had the power to stop the flow of River Ganga.Bhishma defeated thousands of kings who had arrived from all around the world with ease, during the Kashi Princess’ Swayamvara.Bhishma defeated Parshurama in a battle which lasted for around 23 days. The fact that he was defeated was accepted by none other than Lord Parshurama Ji himself. He in fact accepted this 2 times.He once accepted it when Bhishma had readied his blazing Brahmastra. He accepted it once again in front of Amba. Bhishma was among the only few who managed to defeat the mighty warrior Arjuna. Arjuna was fighting mildly against Bhishma. Krishna became enraged at this. Bhishma defeated all the Pandava soldiers and the Pandavas including Arjuna on day 7th. He was aided by Shalya.[LINKED_TEXT: [8]] [URL: #fvpgQ] He was invincible. Why is he at 6th rank? He managed to defeat Arjuna when Arjuna was fighting mildly with him. Check out the screenshot I had provided.He was made to retreat by Satyaki.Bhishma in his old age was not as powerful as he was in his youth.He had himself accepted a no. of times that he was inferior to Arjuna. (5). Bhima The mighty son of Vayu was among the best mace fighters of his era. His archery skills are most of the time underrated.He killed 98 brothers of Duryodhana in archery fights, Duhshasana with a sword and Duryodhana with a mace.He killed powerful Rakshasas like Hidimba, Baka, Jatasura etc.He defeated Jarasandha in a wrestling battle.He killed Keechaka with his bare hands.He killed the powerful Yakshas who were guarding the beautiful flowers.He defeated Dronacharya and Bhishma various times in the Kurukshetra war.Such was his prowess that he defeated Karna 6 times on day 14th itself. I’ll provide information about all his victories. Don’t worry. Most of the times, being chariotless is mentioned as being defeated. This was how it was calculated by Sanjaya.Here, Bhima made him chariotless and forced him to ascend someone else’s chariot. The word ‘vanquished’ is clearly mentioned there. Here, Bhima again defeated Karna. He made him chariotless. Karna was afllicted by Bhima’s arrows and had to go on another chariot. Dhrithrashtra himself terms this as ‘retreat’. Here again, Bhima was overpowering Karna. Bhima deprived Karna of his bow and killed his horses. Duryodhana himself thought that his friend was confronting difficulties and was going to be ‘devoured’ by Bhima. Bhima again deprived him of his chariot and again Sanjaya mentions it as a defeat Bhima again makes him chariotless and defeats him. He even brought down the standard of Karna Bhima again made him chariotless and Duryodhana has to send his brothers to save Karna. Bhima even defeated Duryodhana a no. of times in various archery encounters.Bhima killed 2–3 akshouni or even more army of the Kauravas.He was more fearful than anyone else for Dhrithrashtra and for Duryodhana. A warrior who defeated Karna should be above Karna. Why is he ranked so low? The reason is that he was defeated a number of times by Karna.I will mention only one of Bhima’s defeat by Karna as the answer is already getting too long. He spared Bhima’s life here. Other than this, Karna defeated Bhima 10 or more times on 16th and 17th day. Bhima was even defeated by Dronacharya, Aswatthama etc. (4). Dronacharya The powerful preceptor was very powerful and had some amazing feats to his name. He survived for 15 days and did a pretty decent job as a warrior.He was one of the best strategists who knew almost every war formation.He killed around 2 to 3 akshouhinis of warriors.His skills as a warrior can be estimated by the fact that he defeated group attacks which had Bhima, Satyaki, Yudhisthira etc. in it.Such was his prowess that he defeated Arjuna on day 14 and Arjuna had to avoid him and attack other warriors. It is clearly mentioned there that Drona was invincible.[LINKED_TEXT: [9]] [URL: #aHqRO] Even though he had so many feats, why is he not at third or second or first rank? Dronacharya had fair amounts of defeats in his life.He was defeated by Yudhisthira who was not such a powerful warrior on the 14th night. Dronacharya used a lot of celestial weapons on him but he couldn’t defeat him. Yudhisthira countered every weapon used by Drona. Drona had to abandon Yudhisthira. Dronacharya was defeated by Arjuna, Satyaki, Bhima etc. (3). Aswatthama The powerful Brahamana was among the most destructive warriors. His skills were almost untouched by any warrior except Karna, Dronacharya and Arjuna.His feats are enough to show his ultimate prowess as warrior. He fought mildly with the Pandavas till day 15 but showed his real strength after his father was killed.Aswatthama was only next to Karna on the 14th night. He was destroying all the rakshasas and almost defeated Ghatotkacha.He killed the demon son of Ghatotkacha, Anjanaparva. He killed an akshouni of nairritas who were a type of rakshasas. He overpowered and defeat Ghatotkacha various times.Here, Ghatotkacha was made chariotless and Dhristadyumna, Bhima arrived to assist him. This clearly indicates he was overpowering him. He made Ghatotkacha unconscious and almost kills him. He caused all the Pandava soldiers to run away. Such was his valour, that he killed an akshouhini of Ghatotkacha’s demons instantly. His Narayanastra on 15th day made all the Pandavas, soldiers and everyone surrender it. It can be named as a defeat for every Pandava including Arjuna etc. Even Aswatthama told that they were defeated. Such was the power of that weapon, that it slayed an akshouhini of soldiers.Aswatthama then became enraged and defeated Dhristadyumna and Satyaki. Aswatthama even defeated Bhima even though Bhima had attacked him in a group. Even, the Agneyastra weapon of Aswatthama killed an akshouhini of soldiers. It had to be countered by Arjuna’s Brahmastra. I have already given you information about Aswatthama’s destructive power. He killed 4 akshouhinis which are proved by me. Other than these, he might have killed 1 more. A total of 5–6 akshouhinis were destroyed by Aswatthama alone.His Valour on the last day was immense. He killed all the remaining soldiers of Pandavas. He killed the Upapandavas, Dhristadyumna and Shikhandi in fierce fights. Lord Shiva himself had entered his body. Such was his prowess that Shri Krishna had to take Arjuna, Satyaki and other 4 Pandavas away from the camp that night. He is not ranked above because Karna and Arjuna were better than him. (2). Karna The mighty son of Surya was very powerful and was the best in Kauravas. His feats are enough to describe his prowess as a warrior.His performance in the Rangabhoomi was better than Arjuna according to Yudhisthira.He defeated Jarasandha in a wrestling match in a short time.He defeated all the kings in the Swayamvara of Kalinga Princess. They included powerful kings like Rukmi, Jarasandha etc.He defeated Satyaki various no. of times in the Kurukshetra war.He defeated Bhima 9–10 times and even spared his life once.He defeated Nakula, Yudhisthira and Sahadeva and spared their lives.He defeated a lot of group attacks which were done on him. He was the best when it came to countering group attacks.He defeated every major Pandava warrior except Arjuna in the Kurukshetra war (directly).He indirectly defeated Arjuna when he had used his Bhargavastra. Arjuna accepted his incapablity to counter it. Why is he not ranked above Arjuna? You will get all the information regarding this ahead. (1). Arjuna The mighty son of Indra was the most powerful warrior of Mahabharata. His skills were unmatched. He had no one equal to him in archery except Krishna and Balarama. His feats bear testimony to his strength.He killed 30 million Nivatakavacha demons using his powerful celestial weapons.He killed 1 million Gandharvas using his agneyastra.He defeated all the major Kuru warriors in th Virata War singlehandedly which included Karna, Aswatthama, Bhishma, Dronacharya, Duryodhana etc.In the Kurukshetra war, he was just at his best.He defeated Dronacharya various number of times.He defeated Bhishma a lot of times.He killed important warriors of Kauravas including Shrutayu, Shrutayudha, Bhagadatta etc. He was among those who caused the greatest carnage and destruction.He killed 7 akshouhini army on day 14th itself. Such was his prowess that he was almost incvincible that day and was only defeated by Dronacharya.He also defeated an angry Aswatthama on day 15. This feat was very difficult to accomplish as Aswatthama had already defeated Bhima, Satyaki, Dhristadyumna etc. Apart from this he had various feats which bear testimony to his strength. Now why is Arjuna ranked above Karna? Read yourself. I will provide all proofs from authentic versions. If you have any complaint, tell me in comments. Please don’t downvote or mass report. I have mentioned everything as it was given in the texts. Encounters between Karna and Arjuna. Arjuna alone managed to defeat Karna 4 times in the Virata battle. Contrary to the popular belief, Lord Hanumana was not protecting the chariot of Arjuna as the use of divine weapons was limited or very less in that battle. That battle was more about killing the charioteers or making them retreat. Arjuna managed to do that 4 times. Arjuna first defeated Karna when both of them were alone. Karna retreated after getting humiliated . [LINKED_TEXT: [10]] [URL: #VTLPq] This repeated once again when Karna came back after sometime.[LINKED_TEXT: [11]] [URL: #aStXP] Later Karna attacked in groups only to be defeated twice by the strength of Arjuna’s celestial weapons. First time, he defeated them with an Aindrastra [LINKED_TEXT: [12]] [URL: #HJolU] and the second time he defeated them with his sammohana weapon.[LINKED_TEXT: [13]] [URL: #fFIPx]They never faced in a full fledged combat in the Kurukshetra war except the last battle. Other that these Karna was defeated by Arjuna twice on the 14th day where he was saved both the times by Aswatthama. 1st defeat of Karna of 14th day. Drona’s son, Aswatthama saved Karna here by severing Arjuna’s arrow. In that battle, the mighty-armed Phalguna struck Vaikartana Karna with one hundred arrows that penetrated all the inner organs. The powerful son of a suta had blood flowing from all his limbs. However, the brave one pierced Phalguna back with fifty arrows. On witnessing his dexterity in battle, Arjuna could not tolerate it. The brave Partha Dhananjaya severed his bow and quickly struck him between the breasts with nine arrows. It was a time when speed was of the essence. Wishing to kill him in the battle, Dhananjaya then quickly shot an arrow that was as radiant as the sun. But as that arrow descended forcefully, Drona’s son severed it with a sharp arrow that was in the shape of a half- moon. Severed, it fell down on the ground. [LINKED_TEXT: [14]] [URL: #ZXMDq]2nd defeat of Karna by Arjuna of 14th day is mentioned in the same link which I have provided as a footnote for the above one. In this one, Karna was made chariotless by Arjuna and Aswatthama saved him. O king! At this time, on witnessing Karna’s valour, he drew his bow back up to his ears and dispatched Karna’s four horses to the land of the dead with four supreme arrows. With another broad-headed arrow, he brought down his charioteer from the seat of the chariot. While your son looked on, he covered him with arrows. In that encounter, he was thus shrouded. His horses were slain. His charioteer was killed. Confounded by that net of arrows, he did not know what he should do. O great king! On seeing that he was without a chariot, Ashvatthama took him on his own chariot and continued to fight with Arjuna. [LINKED_TEXT: [15]] [URL: #XhtIJ]Other than this, Karna was also defeated by Arjuna when Kripacharya saved Karna and took him on his own chariot. Sanjaya continued, 'Beholding the son of Pandu rushing towards him like an elephant towards a rival elephant, Karna fearlessly proceeded against Dhananjaya. Partha, however, soon covered Karna who was thus advancing with great impetuosity, with showers of straight shafts, equipped with wings of gold. Karna also covered Vijaya with his shafts. The son of Pandu then once more shrouded Karna with clouds of arrows. Then Karna, filled with rage, pierced Arjuna with three shafts. The mighty car-warrior, Arjuna, beholding Karna's lightness of hand, could not brook it. That scorcher of foes shot at the Suta's son thirty straight shafts, whetted on stone and equipped with blazing points. Endued with great might and energy, he also pierced him, in rage, with another long arrow on the wrist of his left arm, smiling the while. Karna's bow then dropped from that arm of his, which had thus been pierced with great force. Then the mighty Karna, taking up that bow within the twinkling of an eye, once more covered Phalguna with clouds of shafts, displaying great lightness of hard. Dhananjaya then, O Bharata, smiling the while, baffled with his own shafts, that arrowy shower shot by the Suta's son. Approaching each other, those two great bowmen, desirous of counteracting each other's feats, continued to cover each other with showers of shafts. The battle that took place between them, viz., Karna and the son of Pandu, became exceedingly wonderful, like that between the two wild elephants for the sake of a she-elephant in her season. Then the mighty bowman Partha, beholding Karna's prowess, quickly cut of the latter's bow at the handle. And he also despatched the four steeds of the Suta's son to Yama's abode with a number of broad-headed shafts. And that scorcher of foes also cut off from the trunk the head of Karna's driver. Then, the son of Pandu and Pritha pierced the bowless, the steedless, and the driverless Karna with four shafts. Then that bull among men Karna, afflicted with those shafts, specially jumping down from that steedless car, mounted upon that of Kripa. Beholding the son of Radha vanquished, thy, warriors, O bull of Bharata's race, fled away in all. [LINKED_TEXT: [16]] [URL: #jxxvD]Karna was killed by Arjuna on day 17th. The battle was not dominated by Karna , it has been removed as an interpolation by BORI CE. He managed to break the string of Gandiva just once and not 11 times. He just overpowered him on 1 Instance. Whereas, Arjuna overpowered Karna most of the time in that battle.[LINKED_TEXT: [17]] [URL: #FvvjG] I have tried to answer your question in the best way I could. My appeal to all those who read the answer is to accept the facts as it is and comment and tell me if I have given wrong information. Please don’t downvote and report to collapse this one. I have consumed 2 hours everyday from last 3–4 days for writing this answer. To answer your question in short, Arjuna was the most powerful warrior except Shri Krishna and Shri Balarama Ji.

How do I and/or where do I go to get started?","completion":"🌟 If you have 100k to invest passively, here's a step-by-step guide to get started: Assess Your Financial Situation: Before investing, review your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Determine whether this 100k is money you can afford to invest without affecting your essential needs.Emergency Fund: Ensure you have an emergency fund with enough savings to cover 3-6 months of living expenses. This fund acts as a safety net in case of unexpected expenses.Pay Off High-Interest Debt: If you have high-interest debt (such as credit card debt), consider paying it off first. The interest rates on these debts are usually higher than potential investment returns.Diversification Strategy: Divide your 100k into different investment vehicles to spread risk. A common rule of thumb is to allocate across stocks, bonds, real estate, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and goals.Brokerage Account or Financial Advisor: Choose whether you want to manage your investments directly using a brokerage account or work with a financial advisor. If you're new to investing, a financial advisor can provide guidance.Select Investments: Depending on your risk tolerance, consider a mix of index funds, ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds), mutual funds, and possibly individual stocks or bonds.Robo-Advisors: Consider using robo-advisors. These automated platforms create and manage a diversified portfolio for you based on your risk profile and goals.Real Estate Crowdfunding: Look into real estate crowdfunding platforms that allow you to invest in properties with lower entry points. This can provide exposure to the real estate market without direct ownership.Dividend Stocks: Consider adding dividend-paying stocks to your portfolio for a consistent income stream.Review and Adjust: Regularly review your portfolio's performance and adjust your allocations if needed. Rebalancing ensures your portfolio stays in line with your original goals.Tax Efficiency: Be mindful of tax implications. Utilize tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts) to minimize tax liability.Stay Informed: Keep yourself updated about market trends and developments. However, avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term fluctuations.Long-Term Mindset: Remember that investing is a long-term endeavor. Avoid making emotional decisions based on short-term market movements.Continual Learning: Invest time in learning more about investing. Knowledge is your best tool for making informed decisions.Professional Advice: If you're uncertain, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance based on your financial situation and goals.

The astral body is free from gravity just like a fire flame is free from gravity if you light a candle and put it upside down candle flame will still try to go upward. Basically, the astral body is made up of light and once you leave your astral body you can go as far as you want. But you are still connected via your navel from the Astral body to physical body with a shiny silver cord like substance. You can see your own physical body sitting in the same position when you started the AP but now your own self is flying because you have progressed the physical to the astral or light body. You can come back immediately if you think about coming back to your physical body there is no lapse. It is instant just like a thought. The astral body is weightless just like fire or light has no weight. Lucid dreaming is still inside the mind but also inside the body too. If you want to move in a lucid dream you can move your arm or leg and you can feel the sensation of movement but nowhere near AP. You have less control in lucid dreaming and there is no silver cord. You are attached fully to your own body’s each cell and if someone tries to wake you up you will lose the lucid dream state but in AP your body will completely be numb even a needle prick will not move you at all as your consciousness is completely out of your body. In AP your body’s all processes halt to its minimum even your breathing cannot be sensed & you can still be out of body for few days and body will not decay because needed nourishment is coming via silver cord but brain waves, if measured during AP, will come up at Delta level or lower or may not come up at all in certain cases because we do not have the machine or technology to catch or monitor beyond Delta. It is beyond human perception. Our bodies have very limited perception and limits. Our body only revolves around 20 degrees plus or minus. Our bodily temperature can only be between 90 degrees C or 110 degree C. That is too extreme on both ends so we can see our entire life is constricted within very limited degrees. Fire can go up to 1,500 °C or more a dazzling white kind of fire not red or yellow that are too soft. You can see here physical body is only limited to 10 -20 °C but fire can go beyond 1500°C and astral body is all made up of white bright light that is why when in cinema or movies they show out of the body, they always show very bright white simmering light without knowing why?

A: If I wanted to quit after only 3 days, then I would want to leave now, but I would discuss it with my immediate supervisor or manager of that supervisor, or HR, depending on the structure of the organization. I would let them know I wish to resign, and I would ask if they prefer I leave now or work through a two week’s notice. It’s the professionally courteous thing to do. There may be a situation where they really need you to stay through a notice so that they can find someone else for the position so as to avoid putting them in a bind.

Golden ratio on one hand has got into hands of artists and people of esoteric mentality, on another is not seen by hard scientists such as mathematicians, physicists, engineers etc. as of any significant value or usage. Thus, information on golden ratio is processed, multiplied and spread around by people who are too incompetent to apprehend its value properly in other than vague or mystical way, creating garbage knowledge that is obviously naive for people with at least a bit of scientific mindset. At the same time, the best of scientists cannot apprehend its value either, since its usage is too hard and current math apparatus is too cumbersome/static/primitive to handle complex oscillatory dynamics. Hence, not seeing what's invisible, they easily dismiss it, claiming with certainty that golden ratio is in fact worthless. So the answer would be, it's both overrepresented in wrong way in society/media, and heavily underrated in scientific communities. The possibly upcoming new era of biotechology, neuroengineering with new paradigms of less rough cybernetics and more wave-based bio-like phenomena as technology might change this completely (e.g. see [LINKED_TEXT: Who invented golden ratio?

The banks are in all cahoots in this. Do you remember when overdraft fee was only 7 on Monday and then it changed to 34 by Tuesday? All the banks did this together — on the same day. What a coincidence! This was back in 2005. But I can help you. The answer to your question doesn’t lie with with the banks but lies with the credit unions. The banks are mega profit-making machines. Credit unions are nonprofit. Are you OK with this? My credit union charges no fees for overdraft. They will charge you a 25 bounce check fee, but no fee overdrafts from the savings to the checking to pay for all your items, whether it’s one big item, or many small items: zero fees zilch! How does that sound to you? You can overdraft on gas charges, credit card purchases, there are no fees!

Yes there were some empires in the past whose territories occupied both countries territories in modern times, but how big were those empires? Srivijaya even at its peak only controlled Sumatra, Malaya, Western Java, and Western Borneo, while Eastern Java, Eastern Borneo, Celebes, Papua, Moluccas, and Nusa Tenggara were never under their control. Besides that there was Majapahit that only had tight control over its core territory which expanded from Eastern Java to Bali, other than that seems like they didn't really have actual control over lands in the other parts of the archipelago, Trowulan was quite satisfied with the new status of its conquered kingdoms as tributary-vassal states. Many people has mentioned about the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824, saying the Europeans had divided Nusantara into two spheres of influence. However I think the treaty is overrated, people talk about it as if when the treaty was made, the archipelago was living under a single political entity, though the reality was we weren't united, there were lots of different kingdoms at that time. The treaty did divide a Sultanate which located in the Malacca strait, but a Johor-Riau Malay Sultanate was just a small part of Nusantara, it's so small compared to Indonesia's territory today. For certain ethnicities, the Europeans presence in the archipelago did make their people have to live in different countries today. Besides the treaty with the Dutch, the British also made a treaty with the Thai, and the legacy of it is the Malay have to live in Indonesia and Thailand as ethnic minorities. However for Indonesia as a nation, the Dutch presence in Nusantara wasn't a disaster, but a “blessing”, because they were here as our common enemy and their colonial lands were the basis of the Republic territories. If not for those Londo, I don't think the Balinese would like to live in the same country with the Minangkabau, so do the Batak and the Buginese, so do the Dayak and the Javanese, and so do 300 other ethnicities in Indonesia. There're many voices from Malaysia that promote a propaganda like “Indonesians and Malaysians are same people, same nation, same language, same culture, same religion, same race, same root, and etc.”, and surprisingly there're those among us who believing it. My questions to those Indonesians are : “Have you forgot our Youth Pledge? Do you forget that our republic has more than 700 languages and over 300 ethnicities? Do you remember that Jakarta officially recognize 6 religions as equal? Have you remembered our brothers and sisters from Eastern Indonesia?”. When an Indonesian says that his/her country is diverse, he/she isn't lying or joking. If Malaysians don't believe with the idea of Indonesia as a diverse nation, you guys could go to Bali or Jogja (the 2 most popular tourist destinations in Indonesia) and then observe the languages and cultures of the locals, from there you could go to anywhere in your country and do the same thing, after that you would understand, after all seeing is believing right? My answer to those voices from the Monarchy is simple : “Kami bangsa Indonesia! Bukan bangsa Melayu!” “We are the nation of Indonesia! Not the nation of Malay!” *I'm aware that there're ethnic Javanese who living in Malaysia as its citizens, but the big questions are : “Are they still Javanese and preserving Javanese language and culture in Malaysia? or have they became Malay by speaking Malay language and practicing Malay culture?” and “What has Kuala Lumpur done to protect Javanese language and culture in Malaysia? or is the government letting the Javanese assimilating and integrating themselves to the Malay?”. *I'm also aware that there're Malay Indonesians, yet in the country, Malay isn't a nation, but only an ethnic, the term nation in our context only refers to Indonesia."},{"prompt":"What did Jordan Belfort do in The Wolf of Wall Street that was illegal?","completion":"high pressure sales tactic to sell stock.SEC made it illegal to pressure retail investors to buy stock"},{"prompt":"f Republicans are supposedly fiscally responsible, why does the deficit increase every time they are in power?","completion":"It doesn’t.

More Control You will have more control over power and speed, lets say you want to overtake some vehicle so you'll need sudden acceleration, and to achieve that you can down gear and get that but that is not the case with non geared because they are automatic and will always have linear acceleration. In some situations you need power eg when approaching an upland then you can switch into a lowered gear and do that eaisly. More suited for longer rides In addition to the the above advantages if you are comparing a scooter which generally are non geared with the bikes then the tire size plays a vital role by reducing the amount of jerks and have better suspensions too. They also are more stabe in higher speeds. Advantages of non Geared ones City commutes: These are more comfortable for city commutes as you dont have to bother about changing the gears and this makes a lot easier to ride in traffic. You have to hold the clutch again and again in traffic and that seriously hurts. Storage You will get a huge amount of storage in case of scooters which can hold a good amount of things which you cannot expect in bikes,even there is no option of keeping your smallest of wallets or specs.

The fundamental reason is that significant amounts of previously sequestered carbon and hydrocarbons are being brought to the surface, oxidized, and released to the atmosphere. This has already increased the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere to over 25% higher than it has been in over 8 thousand centuries. It is still rising fast with no limit in sight. Water vapor, on the other hand, is limited by the multiple feedback loops and the stabilizing effect of more than half of the surface of the Earth being covered by liquid water. The increase in water vapor in the atmosphere caused by global warming will be insignificant compared to the increase in the energy driving the weather. Some fossil water is being added to the active circulation from both the combustion of fossil fuel hydrocarbons and the pumping of water from deep aquifers at rates much faster than they are replenished. The percentage change will be insignificant.

And for the Cuman part, what is a Romanian? At the beginning it was a mix of people from before the Slavs, Slavs and, among others, Cumans. So even if he was partly Cuman he was still a Romanian. Now, I’m not very fond of him, unlike other of my co-nationals, in my opinion he was a very violent, brutal man, even for his time, but what’s really prevent me from being somehow appreciative (he lived in brutal times so his brutality should be judged accordingly) about him was his lack of strategical thinking. He was an excessive radical, alienating the nobles beyond forcing them into submission, transforming them into enemies.

It’s not easy to become a cyber-security expert, and to become one you need to start thinking like a security person. Unfortunately, universities do not teach how you do that, so you need to get some real-life experience and learn from the industry professionals. I believe that the art of building security solutions is not in the math neither in the algorithms, but mostly in the proper engineering and in the deep understanding of the possible threats you are addressing with your solution. To illustrate my point with cryptography, my approach will suggest that an industry standard asymmetric encryption will do the job, so we won’t develop our own proprietary encryption algorithms. Instead, the most architectural and engineering efforts will be spend on hiding and securing the cryptographic keys, establishing secure channels and authentication of the parties."},{"prompt":"Does any species exist which can’t thrive in captivity?","completion":"The question is “Does any species exist which can’t thrive in capitivity?” Huge numbers of species don’t THRIVE in captivity.

This Could be a threat to many other companies like Amazon, Netflix, Fintech Startups (Phonepe, Paytm and GPay). Jio had spent 3 billion dollars to acquire dozens of Companies in last one year including Saavan, Haptik, Nowflots etc. Jio has more than 388 million users, which is highest among all Indian telecom companies. And Facebook was also desperate to make a big move in India but it had failed previously with Net neutrality. So by Investing in Jio, It could do what they wanted 3 years back. Jio has been working on a super app like WeChat and Indian apps like Paytm or Phonepe. Facebook sees plenty of opportunity with Jio. India is a large market for Facebook; more than 400 million people in the country use WhatsApp, its global messaging service, while more than 300 million people use the company’s core social network. WhatsApp has worked for years to build tools for small businesses and has dabbled in payment systems, while Facebook has also invested in creating digital storefronts for entrepreneurs to sell goods and services online. By bringing together JioMart, Jio’s small-business initiative, with WhatsApp, they can enable people to connect with businesses, shop and ultimately purchase products in a seamless mobile experience. More recently, Facebook has been at loggerheads with the Indian government over WhatsApp. The government has demanded that WhatsApp change its encryption to trace messages back to their source, which WhatsApp has refused to do. At the same time, regulators have repeatedly delayed WhatsApp’s request to offer a payments service to its Indian users. Ambani has also been the most powerful corporate voice urging regulators to take an India first approach that favours companies like Facebook and Amazon. But this partnership can bring life to Whatsapp pay in India. If it is true then Jio will enter in E-commerce and Media Industry using Jiomart and Jio Tv enabled by Whatsapp Pay. Which is the biggest threat to Amazon, they will become head to head competitors Because of Prime Videos and Amazon E-commerce.

To quote Chris P. of the MIT admissions office when he answered the same question about MIT: Why? Because the factors of admissions that can be readily apprehended in a forum post (GPA, SAT scores, etc) are in many ways the least important in our process.Because listing the school you go to or ECAs you are involved in does not communicate the degree to which you are a vibrant member of the community, does not communicate what your coaches or teachers or mentors will say about you, and those are the things we care about.Because it does not include any information about the interview, which is another critical insight into the candidacy of any prospective applicant.Because a forums post cannot communicate the complexity of an applicant’s life story, circumstances, and so forth; even if they were to replicate all the answers to their essay questions, we still have additional data external to the application that we consider in understanding an applicant’s context.Because of a billion other reasons along the way. I fully understand that this is a stressful time. From my own time on Quora, on College Confidential, on the Student Room and similar fora, I know that people can take “what are my chances” questions very seriously. And I have seen this sorely abused. I have seen people roundly mocked for their accomplishments, often when I cannot see anything to mock in their accomplishments. I have seen these taken very badly, I have seen it affect where people apply. I have seen a wide variety of trolling both on the questioner (e.g. “I only have 3 Nobel prizes, can I still get in”) and on the responses (“what makes you think you can get in with only 3 Nobel prizes, don’t be an idiot”) and it is very destructive. Here is what you need to know right now:1) Do you want to go to Harvard?2) Can you afford the admissions fee to apply (and if not, Harvard offers a very generous fee waiver program)? That’s pretty much it. Apply. You might well get in. Last year, Harvard admitted 0% of those who did not apply. Be aware that the admissions is very competitive. Schools like Harvard are reach schools for everyone. The recent Harvard admissions lawsuit (which Harvard won), had the advantage of putting normally confidential Harvard admissions statistics into the public domain. In a recent admissions cycle (in which there are fewer than 2000 available places), more than 8000 domestic applicants had perfect GPA’s; over 3400 applicants had perfect math SAT scores and over 2700 had perfect Verbal SAT scores. Your stats are enough to make you a viable candidate. Beyond that nobody, including the admissions officers can say at this point.

What are the consequences or how will this play out in the Middle East?","completion":"In order to know what the action will be from Iran's end, it’s important to note the history between the US and Iran. In many respects, it has been focused on destabilization- meaning the countries have had animosity towards each other, but, in the case of Iran, there has been the avoidance of strictly getting into pure warfare. Let’s take this a step further and note an extremely important political event: The freeing of American Hostages upon Reagan’s election. This is extremely noteworthy not only because of the freeing of American hostages, but the reasoning as to why. At the time of this, the conflicts between the U.S and the Soviet Union were still fairly present. Apon electing a highly capitalistic US president, the cultural shift of the US at a time of extreme tension meant that, for an upcoming country like Iran, it was best to get out of the way from a new leader like Reagan- who’s temperament was unknown compared to the predecessor of Jimmy Carter. It acts on necessity. Now, let’s compare and contrast this to the positions of the US and Iran today. At this point in time, Donald Trump’s temperament is very well known, and it is Iran that is in a more destabilized position. Simply attending to the fact that Iran is now more destabilized and has an even greater ax to grind, it’s quick to come up to the assumption that Iran could try and begin forming violent conflicts with the U.S. But that’s not entirely the case. Let’s look at the other variables that are present: Iran is not as great of a powerhouse as it used to be in terms of oil manufacturing- and extremely high unemployment along with a currency value of 33333.33 Rial to 1 USD.They just lost someone who, in many respects, was a second-in-command of their state. This is a brutal shakeup when considering further destabilization of the country itself from a political standpoint, making it’s ruling more uncertain. He was a brutal fighting force for them, and his loss puts them at a much greater vulnerability.At the same time, the U.S is also politically shaken. The election in 2020 is incredibly pitting- meaning that the next leader of the country is too early to call, while at the same time, the country is notoriously divided within it’s parties. A soundable echo of the country won’t be backing greater war efforts within Iran.This also means any actions Iran takes right now will greatly affect their relations with the next leader of the US.U.S relations with China are already on thin ice as the country clearly begins to extend itself as a rival superpower, but it’s allegiance with Russia has also grown formidably tighter. Putin is clearly a tough leader, meaning that he is unlikely to act quickly unless these tensions affect Russia directly. This means, that until further notice, the superpowers likely to be involved are the U.S and China. However, under fighting forces in Hong Kong, China will be playing with fire with U.S forces under getting involved. There will be mostly seclusion from other countries until it directly affects them. That being said, what could this mean for conflicts with the US and Iran? Well, let’s begin by being clear about the positions- this would be a game of incredibly difficult offensive and defensive decisions on Iraq’s end- while the U.S’s tactics would be most intended under a more offensive strategy while securing general defensive strategies to deter further escalation. This is clear because, though tempered, Trump is not a war-president. He also cannot afford to further escalate conflicts with Iraq if he wants to continue rallying low commodity prices. If this begins to shift, it’s probably the indexes could begin to show further signs of panic- leading to a correction that would deter the index-fund hot-hoop strategy that most employers and investors use right now. Running into 2020, his best bet is the economy, not war. As a result, what we can predict from Iran will attempt to push U.S forces out- as a direct reaction that they can now explain, at a scale, they could not before. It’s likely Trump will continue to press on this issue- and there are two possible outcomes that form from this. A reaction from the Quds Force and it’s extreme reactivity towards this event will occur brutally inside of Baghdad- destabilizing the entire region and forcing national leaders to begin reacting and re-strategizing relationships with the Middle East. Iran will definitely begin facing further sanctions and could see a destabilizing revolt by citizens. The nation on it’s own will not react further, then focusing on defensive strategy. It will re-shape the country, but it’s effects will be seen most likely through the economy. You can begin to predict a surge of Quds potentially growing attacks and grow it reaches across the middle east, turning it into a political problem for whomever the incumbent president will be at the time. The Iran Nuclear deal will not be saved- and it will cause a panic in all countries- and thus, stabilization efforts from some countries, while others still poke. The US is likely to poke. If this continues to be a growing problem, it is possible at a later time, US forces may invade Iran under a Republican President after Trump.There will be independent attacks coming from INSIDERS in Quds force, demonstrations, and protests. The US will react minimally to these, and grow it’s a military base in quiet overtime to further prevent outbreaks. Iran will not react to any independent attacks, and those will continue as the region begins to further destabilize. Price hikes on imports are inevitable, and you can expect tariffs from the US to also expand as a result, but very slowly over time. Oil prices will be a problem for the next term. The Nuclear deal will not be saved, though there will be efforts to save it by mitigating the damage done. Other countries will take in greater benefits from their power and oil, and will force the US to try and re-open negotiations with Iran. These two broadly outline the reactions that will occur, as the attack is a destabilizing attempt, who effects will be played on extremely thin ice per attack so as not to break the defenses of Iran to the point in which it directly affects the US. Doing so will not bode well for any of the two countries. But the major note you’ll see here is conflict- because war will not be advisable for both countries. However, it will certainly become a problem for the U.S to find a way to deal with- as most destabilizing efforts can produce."},{"prompt":"What company offers good mobile application development services?","completion":"A [LINKED_TEXT: Mobile App Development Company ] [URL: https://lbmsolutions.in/mobile-app-development-company/]specializes in creating tailored mobile apps for your business needs.

So he would spend the day just sitting on the porch. His son, still working the farm, would look up from time to time and see his father sitting there. “He’s of no use any more,” the son thought to himself, “he doesn’t do anything!” One day the son got so frustrated by this, that he built a wood coffin, dragged it over to the porch, and told his father to get in. Without saying anything, the father climbed inside. After closing the lid, the son dragged the coffin to the edge of the farm where there was a high cliff. As he approached the drop, he heard a light tapping on the lid from inside the coffin. He opened it up. Still lying there peacefully, the father looked up at his son. “I know you are going to throw me over the cliff, but before you do, may I suggest something?” “What is it?” replied the son. “Throw me over the cliff, if you like,” said the father, “but save this good wood coffin. Your children might need to use it.” Image Source : Google"},{"prompt":"it correct affirming, in the light of the Scriptures, that the woman who makes abortion does not believe in God?","completion":"The Christian Bible is very clear.

If yes, then what is the equation?","completion":"As Valdis rightfully mentioned in his answer, there are a few cranks who think they do. I happen to be one of those cranks. A theory of everything is not complicated at all. And a Theory of everything should literally and figuratively mean just that. As such it should not only but then especially so include consciousness as well. As for the equation which is nothing at all like the complicated formulations you would expect. For a theory of everything you only need to understand 3 things for what it really is. And that is Time, Space, and Energy and how the 3 interacts and being responsible for the Present Past and Future. And as a result of this you get two interlaced triangles which I like to refer to as Solomon's seal. The three corners of the one triangle represents Time, Space and Energy and the other interlaced triangle represents the Present, Past and Future. And when you get to understand how these two triangles represents everything then you can explain literally anything, even human behaviour. You can even explain how and why Einstein's theory of Special Relativity is 100 percent correct but all for the wrong reasons. Metaphorically speaking. If 2+2 gives you 4 and 4 being reprrsentative of special relativity. Then 1+3 also gives you 4 of which 4 once again represents Special Relativity. However there is a huge difference between 1+3 and that of 2+2 despite the outcome being exactly the same. And herein lies the very problem holding us back from discovering a Theory of Everything. It's like being on the right road but heading in the wrong direction hence East versus West. In both cases you would end up with the sun crossing the horizon. Only problem is the one direction leads you into darkness and the other will make you see the light of day."},{"prompt":"What do you think of the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemning the U.S. Capitol riot incited by Trump?","completion":"He is simply saying out loud what the whole world watched in real time on Wednesday."},{"prompt":"w many seats will BJP win in Lok Sabha 2024? Give a prediction of how many seats BJP will gain in each state.","completion":"The answer to this question is not simple one. It will depend upon many things. First, let us see how the opposition parties unite themselves. If somehow there is fight of one to one candidate as the opposition parties are saying then the BJP will be in trouble. However there are very few chances of this. Second thing is that how much benefit BJP takes from UCC. Thirdly, if it can bring Population bill or not. Fourth wether it gives some special benefits to farmers or not. Om the issue of employment this government is failure one. BJP'S core voters i.e. Middle Class is dissatisfied. Even then, in my opinion, NDA will loose some seats in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Bihar, Madhay Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Chhattisgarh in comparison to 2019 election. It will gain in Orissa, Telangana, West Bengal, and Tamilnadu. As a result BJP itself will get around 250 seats and NDA 300.

My personal opinion? There’s been a LOT of weird shit in the Smith family these last few years and every man has his breaking point. Jada’s “entanglements” caused Will to be basically publicly humiliated multiple times. This was really one of the biggest times when he had put the weird shit Jada was doing behind him and getting back his legendary status. I’d like to get my personal bias and opinion out of the way first. I am 100% in support of Chris on the matter. The joke didn’t have to be funny to you, I completely understand if it isn’t. But the facts are these Chris Rock didn’t even really make fun of Jada. He pointed out that she shaved her head like a movie and that was it. Didn’t say she looked bad or anything just made the joke. Which is VERY tame for a comedian at such a big eventJada herself posted a statement a while ago saying she just wanted to laugh about the condition. I said the same shit when I had to have tons of stomach surgeries and I didn’t want people to throw a fit because a joke was made at my expense when I publicly stated I wanted to laughThey saw that Chris Rock was going to be the host. If they wanted anything to be off limits to the degree that Will would assault him if it wasn’t off limits then they had plenty of time to clarify that with either Chris or the management. I expect anybody who is THAT touchy about a subject to take precautions instead of expecting a comedian to leave a very well known family alone. Even with all that I can understand Will taking action. If he had a problem with it he should have talked to Chris after the show or even yelled at Chris or roasted Chris from his seat. The LAST thing you wanna do as a very influential figure who kids look up to and who is accepting a reward for a film he believes is deeply important, is assault the guy who’s giving the award. This is especially true considering not even an hour later Will Smith would give a speech about how he wants to be an embodiment of love and just spread love and peace in the world I mean his apology which came out like an hour ago is still just briefly mentioning Chris and instead focused on the fans of the movie and the williams family It just felt like a lot of bad decisions stemming from his families myriad of drama these last few years"},{"prompt":"The justice department has told the state of Missouri that they can’t void federal gun laws.

You can go to YouTube and learn from mental health professionals about the tactics of such unsympathetic people --- by typing in: “What Is A Narcissist”?, or “What Is Coercive Control”?, both by Dr. Ramani Durvasula, PhD. Dr. Les Carter, PhD is also good at simplifying this complex subject of Narcissism---he and Dr. Ramani both specialize in Narcissism---which is considered borderline personality disorder (BPD). All Narcissists and those considered BPD use coercive control to manipulate and break their victims, gaslighting is but one of their most deceitful methods of trying to get you to doubt your own thinking and what you know to be true!

Same day voting was going to heavily favor Republicans, as Trump had been urging supporters not to vote by mail. Mail-in voting was going to be massive in 2020, due to the pandemic, and that was going to heavily favor Democrats. Despite this, the President and those closest to him, were far inside their news bubble that they were in complete disbelief when returns shifted as the night went on.

The metabolism is a very strange and complex system, which has the ability to adapt. if you decrease your calories, sure you will lose some weight, however, after a while, your body will adapt to the calories and make that number maintenance. therefore, as soon as you go back to your normal eating habits, you gain weight, as now you are actually on a surplus. The best way, to avoid the Yo-Yo effect, believe it or not, is to increase your metabolism to a point where it is safe and sustainable to cut several hundred calories and be comfortable. in other words, if you go on a slight caloric surplus and weight train for 3 months, and let's say you increase your maintenance from 2000 calories to 2800. now you have plenty of room to cut down and actually use those build muscles in your favor. This way you are still gonna decrease calories, but in a normal range to a point where you are comfortable to be at. let's say 2300. This way you are not only going to ensure that your metabolism stays on point it is fast and allows you to eat more food without gaining weight, you will avoid the unwanted potential yo-yo effect, as well as change your body composition and increase strength.

Should I see a doctor for this or is this normal for fat people?","completion":"It’s pretty normal to lose your stamina or cardio fitness if you’ve been sedentary for over two years AND become obese. So, you just need to readjust your expectations, and start again but more gradually. Keep in mind that you’re two years older and you’re now putting a lot more weight stress on your joints and muscles, from the extra fat weight. I suggest that you begin with just walking for a mile. When you can do that without stopping to catch your breath, then gradually add time to your walk, and/or add speed, and/or add incline, all of which are easier to accomplish on a treadmill. When you can walk very briskly for two miles, uphill, without having to stop to catch your breath (which might take around six weeks or so to reach that level of fitness) and after you’ve lost some meaningful pounds, then you’re ready to run again.

This trend #Boycott UAE originated from Turkey and then picked up by Pakistan as an opportunity- Why does Turkey oppose India and support Pak Turkey’s support to Pakistan over Kashmir is an attempt to counter Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia and Turkey are rivals in the Muslim world. By backing Pakistan, Turkey hopes that Islamabad will side with Ankara and move away from Saudi Arabia. The fact that Saudi Arabia and the UAE have backed India’s position Kashmir is further used by Turkey to woo Pakistan. Strong objection and action by Modi government against Turkey PM Modi cancelled a trip to Turkey. It was a warning given to Turkey that their stand with Pak will be consistent as a stand against India.India withdrew its contracts, 2.3 billion tender granted to Turkey’s Anadolu Shipyard earlier this year to help build five 45,000-tonne fleet support ships for the Hindustan Shipyard Limited is reported to be cancelled.Syria was encouraged by India to become more aggressive against Turkey at international platforms. The Syrian envoy also said, \\"Turkey supports terror and all countries who support Turkey, support terror\\". He said this in response to a question on Pakistan extending support to Turkey's military offensive in Syria. The Turkish regime invasion of Syria is a clear aggression and in violation of all international laws and UN Charter, Syria said.When Erdogan raised the Kashmir issue at the UNGA, Prime Minister Narendra Modi tesponded by holding meetings with the president of Cyprus and prime ministers of Armenia and Greece on the sidelines of the UNGA. All of these states have various disputes with Turkey. So the enemies of Turkey were promised support in future by India.India pushed forward its relations with Armenia. Recently India secured a 40 million defence deal with Armenia. As per the deal, India will be supplying Armenia with four weapon locating radars. So India will help the enemies of Turkey to become more powerful. In short, such trends are made viral by our enemies however India is strong enough to teach them lessons at the right time.

Presumably you’ll cut long sections at once and cut them to size, to make the process a bit more efficient and probably safer. Clamp it all in place, obviously, you don’t want your work or the guide moving around while cutting.

In my opinion, For mutliplayer battles, best strategy is MiLaLoon(26 Balloons, 3 Lava Hound, 10 Minions, 5 Rage spells and take 1 Lava Hound in clan castle troops ). You can also attack with Giants, Wizards and Healing spells. For war attacks, best strategy is GoWiVa(Golems,Valkyrines and Wizards) and 2 Healing spells, 2 Rage spells and 1 Jump spell(you can also take Healing spell if you think there is no need for Jump spell).You can also take Healers instead of Golems and send them behind Archer Queen(only if the level of archer queen is above 20) and Bowlers(in clan castle troops) . One strategy that can be used for both war and multiplayer battle is 30 Miners, 4 Healers, 4 Archers ,5 Healing spells and poison spell. Send the healers behind Archer Queen to clear the base and to kill clan castle troops. And then, send the miners.

First of all, I need to say, that the loss of the 3rd battle of Panipat by the Great Marathas was actually a betrayal. It was not just Rajputs and jats who didn’t support the great Marathas but the 3rd battle of Panipat was actually a betrayal by the Sikhs against the Great Marathas. It was not just the first time that Sikhs betrayed Hindus but they did it earlier too in 1746. Let's come back to the point that why Jats and Rajputs didn’t help Marathas. The answer is, Marathas didn’t have good relations with them at that time because under the leadership of Peshwa Raghunath Rao, Balaji Vishwanath, and Shivaji, the Marathas empire was at its peak and they defeated Nizams, Mughals, Rajputs, etc and that made them against the Great Marathas. The question rises, Rajputs and Jatts didn’t support Marathas, and off-course that is because of their defeat but why Sikhs betrayed Marathas as the Marathas were the ones who saved Sikhs from Durrani in the battle of “Maratha conquest of the northwest frontier” in 1760. The betrayal of Sikhs against Marathas considers being one of the biggest betrayals in history. It all starts in 1760 when Taimur shah (Durrani) attacked the northwest frontier of Punjab (then Pashtuns and Satluj region of Punjab) and Sikhs were outnumbered by the Durrani. Upon a single call by the Sikhs, the fearless Peshwa Raghunath Rao marched for Pashtun and covered the entire journey in 36 hours. Peshwas reached Pashtun and fought on behalf of Sikhs and defeated a Durrani who had 3 times larger force than Marathas. Durrani got the treaty of leaving the place and deposition of money which was given back to Sikhs for their resettlement. And then Durrani left. The bad thing with the Hindu rulers was, they never killed their opponents, let it be Prithviraj Chauhan or Maharana Pratap, or even the Marathas. Durrani returned in 1761 in the first battle of Panipat with a larger number of forces to invade the region. This time he returned with the support of the Oudh empire, Mughals, and off-course Rohillas. The twist comes when Rohillas commander Shuja-ud-Daula who had good relations with Sikhs met Sikhs and he asked them not to come in-between and in return, they will give them the land to Sikhs. Marathas were confident that they will not get support from the Rajputs and Jatts, but they were sure that Sikhs will support them as Marathas were the ones who saved them and Sikhs owes their life to the great Marathas. But eventually, everything got collapsed and Sikhs denied to support them, and it was the Marathas who were fighting against FOUR powerful empires all alone. This particular incident was one of its kind of biggest betrayals in Indian history. Now, you must willing to know what was the 1st betrayal by the Sikhs. Jaspat Rai, a Hindu [LINKED_TEXT: Mughal] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire] official, was the [LINKED_TEXT: faujdar] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faujdar] of [LINKED_TEXT: Jalandhar] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalandhar] and later was appointed faujdar of [LINKED_TEXT: Eminabad] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminabad] by [LINKED_TEXT: Zakariya Khan Bahadur] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakariya_Khan_Bahadur].

The entire event took place when he was on his way to meet his family and brother Lakhpat Rai. As the Sikhs were not capable of killing him anywhere near the ruled region, they caught him alone and killed him just to send a message to Zakariya Bahadur. It was not settled anyway, and Lakhpat Rai ( Brother of Jaspat Rai) decided to take revenge for the death of his brother which was done in the shield of cowardness. Lakhpat Rai as the brother of Jaspat Rai became the revenue minister of [LINKED_TEXT: Lahore] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore] and wanted to take revenge on the Sikhs.

I was visiting the home of my best friend, one of the few times I was invited. Her mother was very charismatic—the kind of person who could talk to anyone—and a genius who graduated from University of Chicago at age 16. Also a beauty. But, out of the blue, her mother stood up, walked up to within six inches of a wall and started talking to it, carrying on a seemingly nonsensical conversation. I was pretty young, certainly no more than seven or eight, but you don’t have to be a genius even at that age to know that this is totally not normal. It didn’t scare me. She was clearly not any threat to me. In fact, I was trying to figure out what she was saying when her dad gently hustled me out of the room. We remained friends, and all the times after when I saw my friend or her mother, nothing was ever said about this. I remember not wanting to embarrass them. My friend’s mother spent many years cycling in and out of state mental hospitals, and was a diagnosed schizophrenic. But mostly what I remember about her was how much fun she was to be with—so lively and captivating. My friend finds it hard to believe that is my memory. That’s because hers are darker and the few “fun” times totally obscured by them. We’ve never talked in depth, but what little she said about her mother was sad. They lived on edge waiting for her next loss of contact with reality, and had to deal repeatedly with committing her and enduring her long absences and returns. My friend also feared her children might inherit the mental illness and so she never had children of her own, but did marry a man with several children. Whenever I mentally picture a psychotic episode, even though I’ve seen far more dramatic ones in movies, this is what has remained with me as the “real thing.”"},{"prompt":"What is the treatment on Discounted bill/LC Outstanding under IND AS, before IND AS same were consider as Contingent Liability?","completion":"As per my understanding of Ind AS.

These tips helped me when I first started dating, so I figured I could help others once I gained some experience and you can meet new people near you [LINKED_TEXT: here] [URL: https://sites.google.com/view/meetyourmatchnow/home?read_current=1]. 1. SELECT YOUR LOCATION image credit: pixabay For first dates, coffee shops are ideal. Avoid Starbucks because they are noisy and have very exposed seating. Choose a local café with a more intimate, cozy atmosphere. Coffee dates can be as short or as long as you want, and they aren't expensive. image credit: pixabay Bowling is a fun activity that doesn't cost much money and can be added to the mix. Most people have gone bowling at least once in their lives, and few dislike it. The light competition encourages flirting and laughter. Bowling, on the other hand, may require more time than you anticipated. Furthermore, you'll be leaving the table to bowl, which may cause the conversation to pause. Bowling may be more appropriate for a later date, but it can be an excellent first date if you already know the person (for example, if you have asked out a friend). Mini golf is similar to bowling, as mentioned previously. Arcades are similar to video games in terms of activity and competition, but with a slightly geeky twist. Ice cream dates, like coffee dates, are best in the late evening and can be as short or as long as you like. Drinks at the bar as a late-night activity if you're of legal drinking age and prefer a spicy or flirty atmosphere. Remember that this can quickly become expensive, and it may be better to save the alcohol for a later date. The pool at the bar is similar to the drinks at the bar, but with a little more lighthearted, flirtatious fun. And, unlike bowling, you're always right next to your date, so the conversation doesn't have to stop for the game to continue. If the weather is bad, you can do everything inside. You could always combine two options, such as bowling and ice cream, if the date is going well. If the weather permits, combine one of the above options with a walk or other outdoor activity! Low-key touching (such as hand holding) is fine, but be respectful about it (e.g., \\"Do you mind if we hold hands?\\") 2. SELECT YOUR TIME Avoid scheduling a first date around a large meal, such as dinner or lunch. Meals are expensive, and you're taking a bigger risk if you don't get a positive result. Morning or early afternoon dates always appear more casual and less sexual than late evening dates, so keep that in mind depending on your preferences. Make a time frame for yourself as well. Mention before the date that you must leave at a specific time after the date begins. A solid window would be an hour and a half. That way, if the date doesn't go well, you can back out without offending the other party. If the date is going well, finishing it on a positive note increases the likelihood of a second date.

WHAT SHOULD YOU WEAR? image credit: pixabay Wear something that makes you look good, dress for the weather or season, and make sure you're comfortable and sure of yourself for the date activity. On that note, avoid wearing orange or brown, as these colors are unflattering to the majority of people. Solid colors include black, red, and blue. Business casual is acceptable; however, a tailored T-shirt or blouse and jeans may also be acceptable depending on the activity. Make sure you smell nice and are clean. 4. START A CONVERSATION image credit: pixabay When you first see your date (whether you're picking them up, they're picking you up, or you're meeting at a location), put on a smile and greet them. \\"Hello, by (their name), my name is (your name), and it's a pleasure to meet you!\\" or \\"Hey, (their name), great to see you again!\\" depending on the circumstances. A brief hug would be appropriate here, but be respectful (for example, by asking, \\"Do you like hugs?\\"). A handshake would be appropriate, but a little too professional for the situation. Read their movements and expressions and choose your action accordingly. Before engaging in physical contact, always obtain their permission. And if someone touches you in an inappropriate way, don't be afraid to say no and establish a firm boundary. Your comfort and safety are critical and should be prioritized. It is also customary in many cultures to greet your date with a kiss on both cheeks! 5. HOLD A CONVERSATION Stay away from certain topics as you go through your date, such as... ⦁ Family saga ⦁ Dramatic polities ⦁ Your sexual habits and history ⦁ Your ex, or lack thereof ⦁ How much money do you have or earn? Unless these topics are extremely important to you and your date, you can only move forward if you are on the same page; or unless you can navigate these topics appropriately, respectfully, and without a narrow mind, it is best not to directly ask about... ⦁ Affiliation with a political party ⦁ Religious beliefs ⦁ Health, including disabilities, physical and mental illnesses, and so on ⦁ Future prerequisites (like kids or marriage) Maintain a positive tone in the conversation. If you can avoid it, avoid self-deprecation. It's fine to make a joke about how you can't cook to save your life or how you're terrified of heights, but only if it's funny and you can back it up with a funny, confident story. Overall, I know it sounds obvious, but be yourself! Learn about them. You're attempting to assess their personality as much as they are attempting to assess yours. After that, your date should have a good idea of: ⦁ What you do for fun, your hobbies, passions, and interests ⦁ Your job, what you do for a living (without mentioning money), and possibly your most basic career goal for the future ⦁ If you're still in school, your educational path ⦁ Where you come from In this regard, you should also have a good idea of your date. Avoid flat questions like \\"What are your hobbies?\\" when asking questions. \\"What exactly do you do?\\" Instead, ask alternative questions, such as \\"So, if you weren't on this date right now, what would you be doing instead?\\" or \\"I noticed on your profile that you enjoy traveling!\\" That's fantastic; where have you been?\\" or \\"You mentioned you like skating, which is really cool.\\" How did you begin doing that?\\" Even if your date asks you a simple question, you can still respond in a way that leads to a more in-depth conversation. For example, suppose your date begins with \\"How are you?\\" Instead of saying, \\"How are you?\\" say something interesting. \\"I'm fine; thank you for asking!\\" I recently began a new Netflix series that has me hooked, so life is good right now. \\"How are you doing?\\" (This would allow him or her to ask more questions, such as about the Netflix series or whatever.) As the conversation progresses, you may be tempted to tell a scary, funny, or crazy story. Go for it, as long as the story ends happily! You can narrate the tale of how a shark bit you and your friends hauled you out or saved you, but if one of your friends drowned in the process, that's nightmare material, not material for a first date. \\"First-time\\" stories (for example, the first time skiing or surfing) can also be amusing as long as they are not sexual in nature. you can learn more about a conversation on chat, click [LINKED_TEXT: here] [URL: https://sites.google.com/view/meetyourmatchnow/home?read_current=1] If the conversation becomes dull, make a comment about the atmosphere. \\"Wow, the bowling alley is packed today. \\"Have you visited here before?\\" \\"Dairy Queen ice cream never gets old,\\" for example. \\"Do you have a preferred flavor?\\" 6. EXTEND COMPLIMENTS Be cautious when flattering your partner. Aside from style, don't compliment physical features. Instead, try to compliment them on things they say, but don't go overboard. complement your choices and actions, not your genes. Assume your date recently mentioned her hobby of writing books. \\"Wow, I really respect that!\\" That must require a great deal of dedication and talent. \\" Painting is another option. \\"Wow! That's incredible!\\" \\"Do you have any images of your work you could show me?\\" Or he casually mentioned a loved one's recent death. \\"I'm sorry; that must have been difficult. You appear to be a very strong individual.\\" AVOID sexual compliments AT ALL COSTS. She doesn't need to hear about her boobs, and he doesn't need someone to compliment his muscles. Discussing his weightlifting hobby and obsessing over his muscles are two completely different things. 7. WHO IS PAYING? image credit: pixabay Regardless of societal gender norms, you should always expect to pay for both parties or split the bill on a date. If you set up the date, you should probably pay for both of you. If your date set it up or it was mutual (like on a dating website), you should probably split the cost. Always offer to pay your share politely, even if the other party has chosen to pay for you. If the date went well, you may offer to pay for it, especially if you initiated the date in the first place. 8. REJECTION OF A SECOND DATE So the date has come to an end. You had a good conversation and are now at home, but you didn't feel the spark. You receive a text message several hours or a day after you leave to thank you for a great time, but you aren't interested in a second date. How do you politely decline? \\"Thank you so much for tonight!\\" I'm not looking for a second date right now, but I hope you have a good rest of your day. \\"You seem like a nice guy, but we're just not the right fit!\\" Have a wonderful weekend. \\"If your date becomes pushy or insistent, a simple \\"no\\" will suffice. After you've shown kindness once, you don't need to justify, argue, defend, or explain. 9. SUGGESTING A SECOND DATE So the date was a success! Allow your date and yourself some time to process the success. Waiting until the next day is ideal, but it's also polite to say, \\"Text me when you're home safe!\\" if the date ends late at night. Send them an upfront message after some time has passed. 1. \\"Hey, I had a great time last night, and I would love to see you again. \\"Can you do (X activity) on (X date) at (X time)?\\" That may seem overly specific, but it's the best way to gauge interest. If they respond positively, you've got this! Fantastic if they respond with a different date or time! If they simply say they're busy, it means they'd prefer another day or time and haven't articulated it properly, or they're simply not interested. Assume the worst. When your date is preoccupied, put the ball in their court. 2. \\"No worries. If your schedule opens up and you want to see each other again, just let me know. Bam. Done. It wasn't difficult, and you handled potential rejection with poise. You don't close off future opportunities this way, but you do appear understanding and non-pushy. I hope these suggestions are useful and not excessive! I know some of these may seem obvious, but I've noticed that many of my friends struggle in these areas.

Written by Niel Menon Source:[LINKED_TEXT: Why are the Kannadigas the least known among South Indians?] [URL: http://www.chennaimemes.co.in/2016/02/why-are-kannadigas-least-known-among.html?spref=fb&m=1] The simple answer: Because Kannadigas are most accommodating and adjustable people in the south. I ( Niel Menon) am not a Kannadiga, but I have lived here for the past 8 years and I would like to share my views here. I've lived not just in Bangalore, but in a few other cities too. I have travelled from Mysuru to Hubbali, from Chickmagalur to Karawar, from Belgaum to Hospet and believe me when I say, Kannadigas are probably the most accommodating people you will ever meet. The Bangalore - Mysuru belt is known for the immigrants, tourists, and backpackers. The locals here are really proud of who they are and would love to share what they have with you - rich culture, traditions, festivals, everything! They don't want anything in return. No need for any media limelight, no need for any viral youtube videos, and there's no need for publicity. Nope, they're good! Go towards Hubbali-Dharward, and you'll feel you're in North India! It's the trading hub of the state and you will find Marwaris, Gujaratis, Marathis, and several other North Indians here. They're the capital of Hindustani classical music and literally every family belongs to some gharana or the other. If you love classical music and some fantastic sweets, just befriend a local because, again, they keep most of this to themselves and you wouldn't know where to look. Coastal Karnataka - Mangaluru, Udupi, Karwar, well, you'll find the most polite Kannadigas here. The dialect they speak here is pure poetry! This is where I learnt all my Kannada! Enjoy the beautiful beaches, the coastal cuisine, take as many pictures as you want, and stay as long as you want. How many non Kanndigas have heard of Bengre Beach, Kaup Beach, or Koodlu Falls? Very few, I'm sure! This is because none of these are openly publicized. Doesn't mean you aren't welcome! You most certainly are! Kannadigas love staying away form the limelight. In fact, they hate the spotlight. Besides, they have always valued education very strongly and this has helped them connect with people from different parts of the country very easily. Allow me to illustrate: I was at a small village called Parkala, about 5 kms from Udupi for a taste of authentic Udupi cuisine. Someone had told us that there was this food joint, a rather shabby and worn down place, run by a very senior elderly couple, Ajja and Ajji, that served the best vegetarian meal we'd ever had. We wanted to give it a shot. The couple who welcomed us in would have been easily in their late 70s or early 80s. Frail, wrinkled, and slightly hunched. But they welcomed us warmly. The place was a part of their own home that they had transformed into a little cafe that served lunch. We all took our place and feasted ourselves to truly the best meal I had ever had. The payasa (rice pudding, I think it's called in English!) at the end blew my mind so hard that I wanted another helping. I looked at my friend and told him that I wanted another helping of payasa. I wasn't too fluent in Kannada back then and I asked him to help me out. So, he called Ajji, the lady, and asked her for the same. She walked towards me, looked at my empty plate, and said: \\"I'll get you a big glass!\\" in the most fluent English. I just gaped at her! Almost everyone in Karnataka speaks English or Hindi - no matter how broken it is! Bangalore would NOT have evolved into what it is today if it was not for the accommodating nature of the locals. It would not have transformed into what it is today had the Kannadigas not rolled with the changes. No matter where you are from, people will try to communicate with you in English, Hindi or even sign language! Yes, there are instances of \\"North Indian Bashing\\" and \\"Bloody Hindiwalah\\" stuff in some places. But most of that is primarily due to some bad experience they have had with someone or the other. Otherwise, they're really peaceful people who'd rather mind their own business than poke their nose into yours. I love Karnataka. The state has been my home for the past 8 years and has contributed significantly into transforming me into who I am today. I have always felt welcome wherever I travelled within the state. As I began to learn Kannada, people would actually appreciate my attempt at speaking the language and that would land with with some additional benefits like a 90 at the price of a 60 at my local bar, fresher fish, cheaper internet installation, getting away without wearing a helmet on a few occasions, etc. When people are nice, I doubt it gives much scope for gossip or bad press.

It is the new way to get your teeth right. Mostly the term cosmetic dentistry is associated with only making superficial changes in teeth to make a patient’s smile look better. But there is more to it than you can see from a distance. Let’s get a closer look at what exactly cosmetic dentistry is, all its aspects, and where can you find the [LINKED_TEXT: best cosmetic dentist in Perth] [URL: https://www.ashtonavenuedental.com.au/dental-service/cosmetic-dentistry]. What is cosmetic dentistry? Cosmetic dentistry is the process of correcting dental anomalies to enhance the appearance of a smile, as well as the functionality of teeth. Dental anomalies are the conditions that stop your teeth from looking and performing their best. The most common types of dental anomalies include: Chipped or broken toothMissing teethChipped or broken tooth fillingMisaligned or crooked teethDiscoloured teeth Cosmetic dentistry helps people enhance their smiles and resolve many dental problems. People having bad teeth know their struggle on daily basis. It is very difficult to chew food properly with crooked teeth. Misalignment of teeth in any severe form whether cross-bite, under-bite, or overbite can damage adjoining oral tissues such as gums or the internal lining of cheeks. Treating it with a proper [LINKED_TEXT: orthodontic] [URL: https://www.ashtonavenuedental.com.au/dental-service/orthodontics-treatment] option can make all the difference. It allows the patient to chew food without hurting. The bad appearance of teeth in the form of discolouration or broken or unevenly sized front tooth can also make some people feel bad about themselves. As a smile is one of the first features that people might notice about a person, people anxious about this fact can worry more about the appearance of their smile. A cosmetic dentistry procedure can hence help uplift the low confidence or self-esteem in many people. They feel happier with themselves and adopt a confident approach towards life after having their teeth corrected.

What does a typical day look like? What are their responsibilities? What do they do to grow their company every day?","completion":"I work out of a co-working space called the [LINKED_TEXT: Frankston Foundry] [URL: https://apply.frankstonfoundry.com/] in Melbourne Australia which is filled with startup CEO’s. Above is an image of the first location we had before we had to move to a larger location. There I work with a lot of fellow startups in tech. Personally, I have my own micro agency focusing on conversion optimization and growth hacking. So the following answer is based both on my own experience and what I have seen from the people around me. What is a day in the life of a start-up CEO? It varies a lot from person to person. I see some of my colleagues get in early others late. Most start their day with coffee, however, most of the time the place is half empty because most of the entrepreneurs are out and about. Some have met with clients, others are busy working on getting early traction. For instance one of the founders in the space Marshall, has a company [LINKED_TEXT: Passel] [URL: http://www.passel.com.au/] which get people who are on the way home to bring a package that they can deliver and make some money on. One day he was working on putting together a booth in a shopping centre nearby which you can see a shot of above. One of the founders of the Frankston Foundry, Cameron, is often out and about having meetings with the city council or going to other networking. James, another co-founder, runs the tech and is often seen walking in a hundred different directions at the same time. Personally, I am seen somewhere between my beloved beanbag and a nearby table connecting with people on LinkedIn, being in communication with my techs, or at times in one of the meeting rooms chatting with clients. To help out the owners of the space at times I do live presentations on entrepreneurship and innovation to high school students. What are their responsibilities? Everything! One of the challenges everyone around me has is that although you might delegate some of the work to others, in the end, it is you are accountable, and most importantly, care the most about the outcome! Add to that that most startups are as well organized as a woman’s handbag and you have an environment ripe for a brain aneurysm. So for instance on one day I might hear a story of stock which has not arrived on time, techs who have not delivered, or a grant application which has to be submitted by 5 o’clock. In the middle of all that there are babies which have to be picked up, coffee runs and the random tray of free food occasionally being close to healthy. Stress levels are at times high but lowered by good (and bad) humour. What do they do every single day to grow their company? I might have answered this one above; if it is a startup, there is probably not a standard day. You have what you said you would do, what you ended up doing, and what you wish you did before, well, everything happened. What I can say from seeing most people around me is that they work more in the business than they want to, sorting out real issues in real time, trying to make the best calls they can base on the information they have at the time, and their gut feeling. The tasks might vary, but what they all have in common is a desire to try and to improve."},{"prompt":"What are some first date tips?","completion":"be yourself."},{"prompt":"tempered glass fragile?","completion":"It is harder to break than non tempered glass and if it does break, it crumbles into small pieces rather than sharp shards."},{"prompt":"What is the most shocking substitution in a football match?","completion":"THE SUBSTITUTION:Krul comes on for Cillessen in the 121st minute much to the latter's surprise. So why does van Gaal do this? THE DECISIONPlanned in advance:This was not a decision that Louis van Gaal took in the last minute. It was something that was well planned out from before. Tim Krul was prepped by the goal keeping coach and was told that if the situation arose, he would have to take the place between the posts during the shootout. van Gaal hid this plan from Cillessen so that it would not damage his confidence or affect his game. CILLESSEN Cillessen was clearly unhappy about being substituted. He probably felt he wasn't believed in or was not a big fan of the fact that he wasn't informed in advance. However, he was seen passionately celebrating each Dutch penalty and also the saves that Krul made. He hopefully understood the genius behind the change. van Gaal made it a point to dispel any rumors of a change in the number one keeper for the rest of the tournament, claiming Cillessen remains his number one choice. THE ADVANTAGESRendered any prior Costa Rican preparation uselessIf the Costa Ricans had prepared for penalties, they would have studied Cillessen and his motions. However, in walked this other guy whom they did not research at all. He's very confident and is mouthing taunts at them. They have no idea who he is nor have they studied his motions. Also, it may have helped that Costa Rica had its previous game go to penalties. He probably observed how they approached that shootout. Surprise, bit**!When you are so surprised at such a critical stage of an important match, you feel outwitted. It's like preparing all night for one proof of a theorem or a topic for an examination because you are a 100% sure that it will be asked and then you find a 100 mark question on something you didn't study for at all. Even though you may still get it, your confidence is not high at all. DeceptionKrul is not a specialist at saving penalties. A record of 2 saves out of 20 is not the sign of a penalty specialist. But did the Costa Ricans know that? He sure looks like a penalty expert for all they know. Why would van Gaal bring him on otherwise? Clearly, a psychological decision and not a tactical one. Pressure and attention off his playersThis was THE MOST IMPORTANT reason as far as I'm concerned. As soon as van Gaal made the change, all the attention deflected from the kick takers to the decision he made. If Netherlands, who have a horrible record at penalty shootouts, had indeed lost, he would have been blamed for a ludicrous decision. No one expected anything from Tim Krul either. Thus, it was a sacrificial move, showing that he was ready to take the heat in case something went wrong. Penalty shootouts are won and lost very easily. It's about handling your nerves well. When the pressure was off the Dutch kick takers, their experience came to the fore. He sent his four most experienced kick takers (with Huntelaar probably in line to take the fifth) to ensure nervousness would play no role in the result of a spot kick. And then, something amazing happened. Four perfect penalties. Even the goalkeeper, Keylor Navas, who had such an amazing tournament and game and should have been coming into the shootout with great confidence, would have been slightly shaken by the sudden presence of the chatty Krul. The Dutch keeper dives the right way each time (5 out 5, saving two of them) after taunting the opposing kick takers into making mistakes. (His first save wasn't really extraordinary or anything.) This is probably the result of his studies of the kick takers from the previous shootout that Costa Rica took part in. The players may have had conflicts about whether they should stick to what worked for them last time or if they should do something fancy to beat this \\"penalty expert,\\" whose job was just to apparently find out which way they were going to go.

The Strings have different properties and may be Zero dimensional, One dimensional or Two dimensional. Electromagnetism is one of the four known forces and it is my opinion that Electromagnetism is a combination of the Electric String and the Magnetic String. The Electric String is a straight one dimensional string and the Magnetic String is a curved two dimensional string so when we combine the two the product is a three dimensional Helical FIELD that propagates in a straight line ( unless altered by external forces ). Combinations of different string types manifest different types of particles and fields. Gravity is the effect of Mass on space-time and is the Negative Energy counter balance of the Positive Energy of the Mass. The preceding text is a type of String theory and there are many to choose from. Presumption all particles consist of two strings. From my perspective this allows for up to 272 different types of particles."},{"prompt":"the US, is it better to send your kid to a public or private school? Are private schools better than public schools?","completion":"Well it seems like the same issue but they're very secret. It's like it's where everyone goes to pretend to be in school. In this day and age anyways. Private schools had dress code and students may get beaten or molested/raped at school or abused at home in their personal lives. This may also go on at public schools particularly with younger kids and the people disappear over state or county lines after, sometimes the kids did zero work or learning and they all got molested or raped all day long everyday by every pedophile that knew. They all get called into a room one by one. It may be necessary to castrate the population. We also thought private schools may be proper regular people or spies but public schools became so full of spies that you would think the entire federal government of washington dc was africans or Asians but there was that one white englewood guy going around as george w Bush calming everyone down. They ruined all the public companies like samsung or frito lay through this wayne westland public school system existing and then it turns into these other businesses that were all provably illegal if we really thought about it and someone tries to take everything over named william r wild. Everyone in westland michigan and surrounding areas were all orphans from an orphanage (it was the same as in the movie Annie and its practically live footage and why the movie was filmed, they pretend it was acting) where they would turn everyone back into kids and try and lock them in one giant abandon brick wall company building, everyone in the orphanages or locked in the buildings had mumps. And they ended up wanting to help mumps or they all wanted to become mumps or yeasts. This is why it was dangerous to be around anyone from living situations like that as capitalists like Louis vuitton, we use to do so much for all of these people for no reason at all. It was very dangerous because they were use to nothing and the worst living conditions. We chose as two dudes to live outside alone or together and we just went around burning everyone's outdoor toys they stole or got through communism or union conspiracies. We were just fine libing outside or traveling as western cowboys or it turns into fascism with constant athletics and building and discussions and events but spies tried turning it into machine food production and grocery stores they can all work at. Eventually we set everyone free and forced everyone to live in houses and only the flu virus would exist and be released a few times a year to kill everything else off. Schools are very contagious and dirty. Lots of people, germs and janitors slack off or people break ionizer to spread disease and doctors or to exist as a disease person who needs a local host. Regardless of degrees, diplomas, certifications, most of the world population (communist or not) is stupid and illiterate, cant comprehend, (it would come backas retarded to everyone who isnt it) or they just look for more school work to do. They use to turn everything into a patent or job process in a class called technology, it had to turn everything into a competition for a prize ir job or money in return. Besides catholics satanists or capitalists that learn as they go on their way or business or pleasure or at home. Mumps and other diseases are going to have to do this again to try and survive, so it will be like the last 75 years of everyone lieing and doing all this annoying and bad shit didnt take place and everyone will return to misery. I don't know why we traded orphans for their mumps."},{"prompt":"Why do console games still get physical releases but PC games don't?","completion":"Every major PC release for the past decade has required you to connect to the internet and link your game to an account of some sort (usually Steam) thus rendering the disk entirely pointless as you can’t link it to a different account. This rendered the disk entirely worthless as you couldn’t use it to install the game on another PC, lend it to a friend or sell it again. Soon gamers decided to just cut out the middle man and just buy all their games online as it was cheaper and easier and you got the same result. The market for physical PC games became practically non-existent. Physical console games aren’t tied to the console. I can buy a game finish it, lend it to my friend, get it back from them and then sell it to someone else. (Sony even did an instructional video) Therefore there is still a market for physical console games and thus publishers fill that market."},{"prompt":"w do needlepoint cross stitch and embroidery differ?","completion":"I concur re the advice to try canvaswork embroidery. The stitches are straight, it is executed on canvas (many different “counts” to the inch or cm, meaning how fine or coarse the canvas is) and you count the threads. It is possible to be marvellously creative with canvas work. Canvas work is a form of counted-thread embroidery. Common types of canvas work include needlepoint, petit point, and bargello. Bargello is the most wonderful type of canvaswork embroidery! There is “Hungarian point”, “Florentine work”, “flame stitch”, “zig-zag stitchery” and these can, once you are skilled, be mixed with other types of canvaswork stitches. You can use woollen yarns, cotton thread, metallic thread and silk thread in the same piece of embroidery. The possibilities are endless! A small, simple piece to get you started: needlepoint hearts. Depending on the choice of colours and design, you can create an embroidery that looks as though it has three dimensions. Geometric 3D Bargello canvaswork. You can also design pieces where it looks as though different parts are woven under and over other parts - another optical illusion. This one too is an optical illusion; a very different type of design. This needlepoint design resembles canework. More optical illusion. A Bargello rope design. You can embroider a Bargello border that looks like an undulating ribbon. This is the famous “carnation pattern”. The colours are rather weird in this photo. I have seen the original piece in the Victoria & Albert Museum in London. It is several hundred years old. Bargello, flame stitch, Hungarian point, zig-zag stitch were very popular in Tudor and Jacobean times, actually. Just look at this example called Bargello roses! Three old patterns for Hungarian point designs. Hungarian point pattern in day glo colours. A flame stitch design, also called zig-zag stitchery. A Bargello design that resembles stained glass. The colours glow! Another, different Bargello stained glass design. Then there is 4-way Bargello, where you count from the central hole and stitch outwards. This design resembles a traditional Spanish glazed tile. You can also design Celtic style needlepoint canvaswork. Another Four-way Bargello design, very pretty (in my opinion). This one is lovely, I think. Four-way Bargello, executed in silky threads. GOOD LUCK and enjoy stitching some fine pieces of needlepoint!"},{"prompt":"Why aren't Macs being built with touch screens?","completion":"Yes, even if they dominate the touch technology in their iPad and iPhone!.

It’s French for Licorice. I am French, and so was the cat (duh). It was in the early 90s. I must have been 13. Back then my house was near very traditional farms, not the large industrial monsters of today, just a couple of pigs, cows, and the like. The land was cheap so the houses were large, gardens expansive and everyone had plenty of fresh air. In my house, we had 5 cats (Ficelle (“Piece of string”), Réglisse, Boud’zan, Vanille, and Charlie), as well as dogs, hens, fish, even a tortoise. A real menagerie. Now, Réglisse was always a bit different. He liked his space. Whilst the other cats were happy cuddling with their humans on the sofa, Réglisse had his very own private spot on top of the shelf. He also ate alone, and even if he was a very sociable creature, Réglisse was more of an introvert. He was never fond of being picked up and preferred to walk rather than being carried. I liked him. He was aloof, in a cool way. One day my older brother brings a new dog - a Labrador pup. His name was Jeff. Réglisse must have had enough of this s**t. He left that night and never came back. I searched for him for days. Then maybe a week later, I hear Réglisse in the street as I walked home from school - I recognized that voice. I call for him, and here he is, popping his head out of a bush! A little girl comes after him. Maybe 6 or 7 tops. She looks at me, picks up Réglisse, and tells me, “I don’t like when he goes into the streets”. For a brief second, I thought to tell her it was MY cat. But then, I thought, they both looked happy. So I nodded, and said, “nice cat, where did you get it?” She smiles and says “He just came to our house. he likes my dad’s bookshelf”. Damn, Réglisse. — PS: Réglisse would still pop by for a few minutes to visit - but never came into the house ever again."},{"prompt":"x^{2}+y^{2}=2","completion":"x + y = 2 So, (x+y)^2 = 2^2 x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 4 (x^2 + y^2) + 2xy = 4 (2) + 2xy = 4 2xy = 2 xy = 1 I suppose this is where answer should end"},{"prompt":"What are some recommended laptops for college?","completion":"Everyone has their preferences and [LINKED_TEXT: needs when it comes to laptops] [URL: https://laptopschamp.com/how-much-storage-do-i-need-on-my-laptop/].

What didn't bother me was what a 23-year-old man chose to get tattooed on his arm. Whatever the tattoo, whether you like it or not, is how you express yourself. on his skin. If a Junkook tattoo bothers you, maybe you should take a moment and think about why it affects you. Hate the spontaneity of his decision? Maybe tattoos in your culture or environment are objectionable, making it uncomfortable to see the guy you love get a full sleeve?

This may be due to specifics in timbre and such, so the proper performance aids in getting the correct sound.There are techniques that are accepted as standard or typical.

Look for the flash in the lower left corner. The fragments were maybe a kilometer or so across, impacting at 60 km/s. Assuming the same density as water, this would mean an impact energy, or explosion energy of over 400 megatons for an average fragment, possibly up to ten times more energy for the biggest. A 400 megaton explosion is about an order of magnitude bigger than the most powerful nuclear bomb in existence, or maybe about 2–3% of humanity’s total nuclear arsenal.

Being a Kannadiga and having lived in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Punjab and now in the US, I believe that I am in a fairly good position to answer this question. I have tried reading most of the answers and wont elaborate on the obvious but pardon me if its repetitive. I think the single most important reason for this is the DIVERSITY that Karnataka has to offer. If India is the one of the most diverse country in the world then Karnataka is undoubtedly one of the most diverse states in India. It would not be completely wrong to say \\"Karnataka is like an India within India\\". DIVERSITY Karnataka can be broadly classified into four regions. 1) Mumbai Karnataka 2) Hyderabad Karnataka 3) Mysore/Bangalore Karnataka and 4) Mangalore Karnataka. Even though Kannada is the official and the most common language in all of these regions, it still has a lot of influence from other regional languages as well as languages from neighboring states. 1) Mumbai Karnataka The most prominent cities in this region are Hubli-Dharwad and Belgaum. It is almost impossible to find anyone from this region who does not understand or speak Hindi. Both these places were also under the maratha empire and you can see a lot of Maratha influence in these places especially in Belgaum(now known as Belagaavi). In fact, even the Maratha Light Infantry regiment is located in Belgaum. Till a decade ago, people from these regions used to prefer cities like Mumbai or Pune to relocate over big cities in Karnataka like Bangalore or Mysore. Even if you look at the traditions followed here, these places are closer to Pune than Mysore/Mangalore. Even the Kannada spoken here is quite different from the one spoken in the southern parts of Karnataka. This place has also given us some of the most prominent singers like Bhimsen Joshi and Gangubai Hanagal(both Hindustani Classical singers). It is also a bastion for the Hindustani music rather than the more popular Karnatic music in the Bangalore and Mysore regions. So when people from here move out of the state and meet other people, they would not easily associate themselves with Bangalore/Mysore because of the cultural differences. So the unity among the people is not as much as in the case of say Tamilians or Andhraites. 2) Hyderabad Karnataka Its the same case with cities like Gulbarga, Bellary and Bidar where you can find a lot of influence from the bordering Andhra Pradesh. In Bellary, it is highly unusual to meet a person who doesn't understand Telugu. Though Kannada is the most commonly used language, it is not the only language people know. 3) Mangalore/Karavali Karnataka The Kannada used in this region is by far the most grammatically and textually correct version of the beautiful language. People from this region speak impeccable Kannada with the least influence from English or Hindi. But even here, a large portion of the population uses Tulu instead of Kannada for all non-official usage. Konkani and Kodavi(in Kodugu) are also popular languages in this region. 4)Mysore region This region does not face any competition from other languages. Kannada is the most spoken language here.Due to the proximity, I also include Bangalore in this region. Now most of the songs or movies made in Kannada cater mostly to this population. The Problem and the Solution This diversity leads to the problem of identification. Because of so many cultural, traditional and geographical differences among the regions, it is difficult for people to relate to one true identity of the state. This is also one of the most important reasons why our film industry is in this pathetic state. I can hardly remember a movie that catered to say the people of North Karnataka or was entirely in North-Kannada dialect. So the people from other regions don't feel the same \\"connect\\" that say a person from Tamil Nadu would feel after watching a Tamil movie. But thankfully, the situation is improving now. People from Hubli/Belgaum or Mangalore prefer moving to Bangalore now instead of Mumbai due to the IT jobs and the development of Bangalore as a whole. The popularity of Kannada film industry can also be improved by incorporating actors and languages/slangs from other regions so that people from all these regions feel more connected to one true identity of the state.The identity of a Kannadiga."},{"prompt":"w do people who eat only once or twice a day manage to not feel hungry between meals?","completion":"You make sure that the food you do eat is nutritious and filling - eggs, walnuts, salmon, high-fibre carbs - and of course your stomach gradually adapts."},{"prompt":"ECB departing head Draghi insists that Germany and the Netherlands simply must spend more in the struggling EZ. What are the chances?","completion":"Not good. Hyper Inflation looms large in the German pysche. Sadly the Germans have been comprehensively lied to about the cause of German hyperinflation. It was caused by the banks, not the government. The banks loaned speculators money to short the Reichsmark. And when I say “loaned” I mean “created”. This wasn’t money that existed in bank accounts and was loaned out, the banks created the money out of thin air. The government eventually stamped this out & the hyperinflation stopped but its the banks who caused it. Not expansionary fiscal policy by the government. Now the Germans who run fiscal policy making don’t know this, They have never been taught that banks create money. Its a bit of a well kept secret that’s actually been known within some circles for over a hundred years. They think that expansionary fiscal policy IS THE WORK OF SATAN! They think that running a deficit is SINFUL ! Germans aren’t big on debt. Even as recently as the Noughties I had a hard time using a credit card in many stores in Munich. However, Government “debt” and household “debt” aren’t the same thing. If your economy grows 2% you need 2% more money. Which means issuing bonds to the tune of 2% of GDP. Which is creating money, not borrowing it. Yes, OK, in the ERM, as a member you are borrowing it, but the ECB aren’t borrowing it. They just create it. The ERM complicates matters but Germany’s unwillingness to use expansionary fiscal policy is because they think the finances of a state are the same as a household.

I had an affect on this man, he was very in to me and very much making it known, what I heard in my head was that I can't possibly be doing that because I'm not that special. How can he possibly like me? I'm not that beautiful. How can I keep up with the conversation with my crap qualifications? When he asked me questions that came up, things that I absolutely have no question about in my head, I couldn't answer, because I didn't trust my judgement enough to answer. Truth be told I'm very flattered by this man's interest, but every ounce of me is rejecting it because of the abuse from narc. How can it be that someone likes this worthless person? How can anyone take me seriously enough to respect me? How can I function without my narc to assist me in making decisions that I previously made for 36 years without his guidance? How can my reality be this damn skewed? Take time. When you believe the trauma bond is broken, just take that bit longer to heal. It's a tough one to repair as bandages and plasters don't work."},{"prompt":"Why is there so little trash on the streets of Vancouver, British Columbia, relative to any other city, such as San Francisco?","completion":"I love BC and the main reason is BC does not let the homeless run the city and they enforce dumping trash on the streets. SF on the other hand has zero enforcement against homeless encampments, RV on the street being lived in, camping on the streets, underpasses, alleys and where ever you want.

Here are some of the key advantages of using a recumbent exercise bike: Comfortable and supportive seating: Recumbent bikes have a reclined position with a large, padded seat and a backrest. This design provides excellent support for your lower back and reduces strain on your joints, making them particularly suitable for individuals with back or joint problems.Reduced impact on joints: The recumbent position allows your body weight to be evenly distributed over a larger area, minimizing stress on your joints, especially the knees and ankles. This makes it an ideal choice for people with arthritis or those recovering from injuries.Cardiovascular workout: Like other types of stationary bikes, recumbent bikes provide an effective cardiovascular workout. Regular use can help improve heart and lung function, increase stamina, and enhance overall cardiovascular health.Lower risk of injury: Due to the supportive seating position and reduced impact on joints, recumbent bikes offer a lower risk of injury compared to high-impact exercises like running or jumping. This makes them suitable for people of all fitness levels, including beginners and those with physical limitations.Muscle toning and strength building: Recumbent bikes target various muscle groups, including the quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, glutes, and even the core muscles. Regular use can help tone and strengthen these muscles, leading to improved lower body strength and stability.Convenience and accessibility: Recumbent exercise bikes are typically compact and can be used in the comfort of your home. They are easily adjustable to accommodate different body sizes and fitness levels, and you can exercise at any time that suits your schedule, regardless of the weather conditions.Multi-tasking and entertainment: Recumbent bikes often come with features such as built-in workout programs, resistance levels, and digital displays that track your progress. Many models also have holders for tablets, allowing you to watch videos, read, or listen to music while exercising, making your workout more enjoyable and engaging. It's worth noting that while recumbent exercise bikes offer many benefits, they may not provide the same intensity or calorie burn as some other forms of cardio exercise, such as running or cycling outdoors. However, they remain an excellent option for individuals seeking a low-impact workout with added comfort and support."},{"prompt":"What are the best ways to invest money?","completion":"The best ways to invest money depend on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some common and proven investment options to consider: Stocks: Investing in individual company stocks allows you to own a share of the company's ownership. Stocks have the potential for significant returns, but they also carry higher risks. Diversifying your stock portfolio is essential to reduce risk.Bonds: Bonds are debt securities issued by governments, municipalities, or corporations. They offer a fixed interest rate and are considered lower risk compared to stocks. Bonds are suitable for more conservative investors or those seeking income.Mutual Funds: Mutual funds pool money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other assets. They are managed by professionals and offer built-in diversification.Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs): Similar to mutual funds, ETFs represent a basket of securities but are traded on stock exchanges like individual stocks. They offer diversification, low expense ratios, and can be bought and sold throughout the trading day.Real Estate: Investing in real estate can be through direct property ownership, Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), or real estate crowdfunding platforms. Real estate can provide rental income and potential property appreciation.Retirement Accounts: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged retirement accounts like 401(k)s or Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) to benefit from tax breaks and long-term growth.Peer-to-Peer Lending: Involves lending money to individuals or small businesses through online platforms, earning interest on the loans. Be aware that it carries higher default risks.Certificate of Deposit (CD): CDs are time deposits offered by banks with fixed interest rates and maturity dates.

However, as the Kobayashi Maru is specifically designed to be a no-win scenario, it is unlikely that Data, or any other Starfleet cadet, would be able to pass it without violating the rules of the simulation. In the Star Trek universe, the purpose of the Kobayashi Maru is to test a cadet's character and decision-making abilities in the face of a situation that cannot be solved through conventional means. The scenario involves a civilian ship, the Kobayashi Maru, being stranded in enemy territory, and the cadet must make a choice between rescuing the ship and violating the Federation's neutrality or abandoning the ship and leaving the crew to their fate. While Data's advanced computational abilities and lack of emotional bias may give him an edge in analyzing the situation and making the best decision, the outcome of the scenario is ultimately predetermined to be unwinnable. In Star Trek canon, only one person has ever \\"beaten\\" the Kobayashi Maru, and that was James T. Kirk, who famously reprogrammed the simulator to allow for a different outcome. Therefore, while Data may be able to perform exceptionally well in the scenario and impress his instructors, it is unlikely that he would be able to pass the Kobayashi Maru without violating the rules of the simulation or reprogramming the simulator itself."},{"prompt":"Who would win between Mr. Mxyzptlk (DC comic) and Gojo (Jujutsu Kaisen)?","completion":"Myx has much greater feats than Gojo.

So this do not let anyone to write the contrary to you. I may try to answer your question by another question: what makes you think so? And second question: You compare Armenia to which other country to make such a judgement / having a such mindset? Your answers to yourself will be the answer to your question. Now let me say some things that can make you see things differently. A country is not a block of marble, all country in the world are just mosaics: they are all composed of multitude of people having different ideas, traditions and way of life. I can not say to any country that it is entirely xyz. Because some people in this country are abc others in the same country are xyz etc. Now on the other side, every countries\`s government in the world, due to historical geographical and many other factor, may act and speak differently in time. That is normal. Some political actions and speechs are bad and some others are good and some others are semi good semi bad. Also a judgement of xxx as \`bad\` by person A, can be judged as \`good\` by B and \`semi bad/semi good\` by C. All 3 say some real/true things, and some unreal/lies. And some others may just express a hope, a dream/ a future strategy. So No one can say that any of them is right and the others are wrong. Read and listen to all the 3 opinions, and make a synthesis by yourself. The good thing in synthesis it makes a mixture of all and just leave some questions. That is a good way to see things. So analyse Armenia using this technic. Just an additional tool to you for seeing that opinion of the same country may change in time too: An X country could have been conservative in its majority yesterday, but today they may become non-conservative in its majority. And tomorrow this may change into modernism and reformism or any other political tendency you can imagine. All are due to many internal and external factors. As you can see it is way too much complex to get a judgement about a country. This may explain you why I wrote the first two question at the beginning of my actual writing. Everything in this world should be seen like ying and yang: you may never judge with black and white but with grey. If you want to know more about any country, so about Armenia, you might read from different source (because when someone talks about a country, there is always propaganda in each writing and speech). So you must read different propaganda writings (even scientists, political researchers, think tanks do propaganda in their writings; that is human nature) and listen the opinion of different political personalities. I lived in Russia and in Kazakhstan about in total 5 years. I met some Armenians there. Communism tendency Armenians think completely different than conservative and modernist Armenians.

Ok qualitative is by its very nature based on not having a precise scale or point of reference. The water is hot. Qualitative! The water is 47.340 degrees Celsius. Quantitative! Qualitative is your opinion, it is compared in your head to something else in your head. “The joke is very funny” Tell a joke to 100 people and ask them to describe how they would categorise the joke and you actually have 100 non comparable scales being used. Their replies are how they feel and you then have to interpret that information by comparing how you believe they they feel about the joke. However, you yourself are now comparing relative feelings based on your interpretations. A machine cannot do that because it requires perception, machines measure they don't perceive. Look up a 1960’s computer “composing” music randomly in real time. People actually did this and gave their opinion on this new and novel music. It sounded crap, there was no structure at all and it was not by even music by Jazz standards.

I am answering from my own experience of an unhealthy and possibly abusive relationship. children. The way the law in my country works I am pretty sure that if we split he would get 50per cent custody of my child at least. While I know that for a child to be in the home of an abusive relationship is damaging I fear that if we split and my partner had 50 percent custody of my child the situation would be worse. His father would become more bitter and angry which would affect my child. I would not be present to intervene when he got stressed and angry at my child. He would be emotionally manipulative and turn my child against me and my family. I have already seen how he manipulates my child and think it would be much worse if we separated. Some people will tell me that my child will realize when he is an adult. I am not confident about that and want to spare him from the stress of listening to his father say bad things about me. As I grew up in a family where my parents divorced I know that divorce (while it may be the best option for some) is not a magical solution that heals all problems and that when parents try to turn their child against each other it can be very upsetting and stressful for a child. I am doing things to try to limit the damage to my child, eg visiting my brother and sister-in-law so my child can see a couple that has affection for each other. you are manipulated by your partner into blaming yourself. One of my partner's favorite things to say to me during an argument is that I should have a long hard look at myself in the mirror. Every time that gets to me and I have doubts about myself. The emotional abuse I got from my partner was a major contributor, I believe, to me becoming mentally sick, although he tells me I brought it on myself. When he told me that I needed to see a psychologist, as a put-down, that was some of the best advice he gave me. When I followed the advice and saw a psychologist she gave me information about abusive relationships.isolation- they isolate you from friends and family who can tell you that the abusive persons expectations are not reasonable.the cycle of violence. I have seen other answers referring to this, using various names for it. You have a cycle where you have bad times, the abuser may apologize, they may act normal and then the abuse happens again. During a good time, you think maybe the bad times are over. You think “well people say there are good and bad times in a marriage”, you don't want to be a fairweather friend but want to be there through thick and thin, etc.religion and your marriage vow such as “for better or worse”.

Sometimes mud sticksperhaps because my parents divorced I hadn’t had enough experience that a relationship could be better. I had also heard divorced and married women complaining about men but didn't hear a lot of positive comments about men so didn't have high expectations of men's behavior. Also as Lori Jones wrote the more committed I became in my relationship or the more dependent I was on him the worse he was. He became worse the week we got married, worse when I became pregnant, worse when I had the baby, worse when we moved far away from my family and friends and I became mentally sick. Having a bit more financial dependence and better health now helps me to stand up more and feel better, as does getting some professional help. As a side note, I hate it when I hear people commenting about all the divorces these days and that people don't try enough anymore. The people who say that should be grateful that they simply have no concept of what some people have been through and how hard they tried.

Japanese pilots were so poorly trained at this point (due to high losses, lack of fuel/aircraft for training) and American defenses strong (combat air patrol, ship screen deployment, proximity fuse anti-air fire) that it was unlikely they were going to score many hits. It’s also in a way, a waste of resources to train them super well just due to the superior American planes and pilots. They’re just too likely to die in a regular dogfight. Let’s say they can drop a bomb and hit a ship 8% of the time- even if they hit it’s possible Americans can control the damage. It’s also highly probable a pursuing fighter or some AA fire will take out the Japanese plane as it leaves. If they fly in and crash the plane directly into a ship- it doesn’t really matter if they take a hit on the way down or not. Let’s say 25% of these kamikaze runs are successful- that’s more than three times as effective and the aviation. fuel combined with ordinance carried would do a lot more damage than the bombs alone.

In the case of the Palestinians, they also have the misfortune of leaders who have gotten rich from the conflict, and therefore have every incentive to keep it going. These leaders also have a reputation for brutality and not tolerating dissent in any form. As a result, Fatah rules the Palestinian areas of the West Bank with an iron hand, and hasn’t held elections since 2005.

Others, like Egypt were experiencing political unrest so the CIA’s activities were being curtailed. So Guantanamo Bay was chosen. Here the prisoners had neither legal, or human rights. They could be, and were, tortured. They could even be murdered. Who knows? Maybe some were murdered. Some of those they were holding there wasn’t even who the CIA thought they were.

He had a very aggressive contract that I reluctantly agreed to and I kept to the letter of the contract. As the contract was coming to termination he sent us notification that the rent would be increasing by some insane amount (I think it was between 600 - 900 a month) we politely declined to renew. We asked if he would allow us to extend the current contract for a month so our kids could finish the school year but he was adamant that we be out of the house by a certain date and we agreed. ( I had to relocate my 8 month pregnant wife and our children out of state while we waited for our offer to close on the new home we were buying.) Then he ran into a problem. No one wanted to rent the place at the price he was asking or would agree to his insane contract terms (i.e he wanted family pictures so he could give them to the police if needed.) A week before our contract expired he contacted me and asked if I wanted to continue renting the house at the existing rate. I laughed and thanked him for his call and informed him we were just wrapping up the last few items prior to the final inspection. When he and his wife arrived for the inspection they were surprised at how nice we maintained the house. He tried again, now that the house was completely empty and spotless, to get me to reconsider the lease at the original rate and I declined. A month or so later we found out he hid our trash cans that were supposed to be picked up by trash removal company so I had to go back to the new tenants and help them understand that trash cans they were using didn’t belong to the land lord and they needed to return them to Waste Management. So just keep in mind if your landlord is offering you a lower rate to stay chance are it’s because they are having difficulties not because they are trying to be kind."},{"prompt":"f you led a group of Spartans what would be your strategy/tactic be against English longbow archers defending their castle walls?","completion":"If the English had not heard of the Trojan Horse, this might be an option."},{"prompt":"Who are the best Canadian immigration consultants in Chennai?","completion":"I would strongly recommend Greentree immigiration.

Digital, low voltage differential signals either get there, or they don’t… these are much cheaper to make than analog cables, which can gradually degrade your signal. Oh, wait, you’re buying them here? At the Big Box store where you’re probably buying a television? Shame on you! Fact is, there is nearly perfect competition in the electronics business. In a minute or two, I can find out exactly how much I should be paying for that new 4K television I’ve had my eye on (hmm… about a grand… it’s been dropping in price!). Your local big box store can’t get away with charging significantly more than an online retailer would charge. But when you buy that TV, you’re going to be anxious to hook it up, maybe add a few accessories. And that’s why these prices are so high. Some stores will make significantly more money on accessories in the typical sale than they make on the main item. And that’s because you’re not paying attention to the price of the accessories… you just dropped a grand or more on that new TV. You’re probably not thinking that you can get the same cable online, in a day or two, for 5 rather than 40. This is actually part of a general sales model these days. Even in Wal-Mart. When you got to a Wal-Mart, there are big signs telling you how much you’re saving on various items. The Wal-Mart people have been studying buying habits in thousands of stores, and they know which items are price sensitive and which are more likely impulse buys. One example: books. Okay, sure, who both shops at Wal-Mart and reads? But seriously… years back, around the time I got my first Android phone, my wife wanted to shop for a few things in a Wal-Mart. I was testing out the new barcode app, which scanned a barcode and gave me a bunch of prices and locations for the item. I was amazed that every book at Wal-Mart was full list price, significantly more expensive than Amazon. Because, of course, no one goes to Wal-Mart to buy a book… but if you see a book while passing the book section, you might just grab it, without price shopping. Or an HDMI cable."},{"prompt":"the greatest design classic the Fender Stratocaster?","completion":"What is your category for comparison? please let us know.

Checks were usually between 200 -500 dollars - no worries. Stuff it in my pocket and go back to work. One time, the teller looks at the check, and looks at me. She looks at the check and looks at me. She calls for her boss. She looks at the check and looks at me. She then has a hushed phone call, I guessed to my employer. I didn’t take this stuff as an insult. I was working in an un-cooled warehouse in the deep south, and I was a pretty shabby dresser at the time. The teller returns and pushes THIRTY-EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS across the counter to me.

I guess a 1:6 teacher to student ratio is pretty good, but are the teachers better at teaching or is it just something that the affluent can brag about?","completion":"The number one reason why private schools are “better” are the admission requirements. If you don’t measure up- to a certain minimum, you can’t attend. When you then take averages of the kids using whatever metric you choose, the average of the school that takes the average to good students will be much higher than that of the one that takes lousy to good students. The private schools pick and choose while the public schools are required to take anyone who lives in the local area, no matter their abilities or disabilities. Charter schools play this game all the time. The student that applies for a lottery is by nature a better student than the one who doesn’t care. Will a lazy student attend a charter that requires 8–5 classes, or Saturday classes, or the constant pressures of a place like KIPP? If a student doesn’t measure up at a charter, they are encouraged to switch back before they affect averages or graduation percentages. Second, the tuition and the ability to expel. Again, better students make for better averages. If you’ve let go students who don’t work hard enough, or who do stupid things, your “scores” go up. If a family is mostly well-educated, it usually means that they are also willing to put effort into the things that make up education. If every role model is motivated, educated, willing to work 3 hours a night on homework, then the student probably will too. Selection comes up again with out-of-town students. Public school draws from the local area, good or bad. Private schools draw the best students from a much larger area, and often from out-of-country. If you’re sending a child 12,000 miles and prepaying all tuition/fees/room/board, you’re not sending a dummy. The final reason is that private schools don’t get scored on the same metric as public ones do. A public school is made or broken on the same scale and criteria, while the private school will hire a PR company to showcase them at their best. We have this in Vermont. The public schools use one set of testing, while the private academies may trot out their SAT results or their AP results, conveniently forgetting to mention that 1/2 of their senior class is from other countries, and are re-taking calculus to get the AP credit and learn some English. Maybe the private school talks only about its endowment, or has pictures of its beautiful campus. Here in Vermont, there are four private schools that are also the local public school. Their students take the same standardized tests, but the private schools don’t have to make bad results public."},{"prompt":"ve you ever found out your kid wasn’t yours by getting a paternity test?

To figure out a purpose for your life that you want to devote yourself to, you need to know what you find meaningful. A true purpose is only sustainable as long as it is meaningful to you, because this is the only way to achieve fulfillment. Holocaust survivor and psychiatrist Viktor E. Frankl spent his life helping others to create meaning in their lives. The Sources of Meaning There are three main sources from which a person can create meaning in life. 1. Doing something significant (work, good deeds, accomplishments): Meaning can be found in doing something that we consider important and of value, something that improves the lives of others or of humanity as a whole. This is of course very subjective, but you will know deep down if you deem this work as significant and fulfilling. 2. By experiencing something or encountering someone (love, beauty, nature): Experiencing nature, beauty, culture etc. can result in a feeling of awe and give meaning to life. Also love can create meaning, because only through love, one can “grasp another human being in the innermost core of his personality.” Frankl explains as follows: “By his love he is enabled to see the essential traits and features in the beloved person; and even more, he sees that which is potential in him, which is not yet actualized but yet ought to be actualized. Furthermore, by his love, the loving person enables the beloved person to actualize these potentialities. By making him aware of what he can be and of what he should become, he makes these potentialities come true.” 3. By our attitude in times of adversity (suffering, guilt, death): Meaning can be found even in spite of the “tragic triad”: I) suffering, II) guilt and III) death, through what Frankl calls “tragic optimism”: “(I) Turning suffering into a human achievement and accomplishment, because in some way, suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice. (II) Deriving from guilt the opportunity to change oneself for the better. (III) Deriving from life’s transitoriness an incentive to take responsible action.” In general, Frankl suggests the following: “Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather he must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible. ” Meaning exists as potential. By taking on responsibility this meaning can and should be actualized. But most importantly, the three sources of meaning all have one thing in common. The idea of self-transcendence. Frankl describes the relationship between self-actualization and self-transcendence as follows: I have termed this constitutive characteristic “the self-transcendence of human existence.” It denotes the fact that being human always points, and is directed, to something, or someone, other than oneself — be it a meaning to fulfill or another human being to encounter. The more one forgets himself — by giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love — the more human he is and the more he actualizes himself. What is called self-actualization is not an attainable aim at all, for the simple reason that the more one would strive for it, the more he would miss it. In other words, self-actualization is possible only as a side-effect of self-transcendence. This has profound consequences for our understanding of the hierarchy of human needs. The ultimate source of meaning and fulfillment and thus the top of the pyramid is self-transcendence. In “Father Reaches of Human Nature” Abraham Maslow explains: “Transcendence refers to the very highest and most inclusive or holistic levels of human consciousness, behaving and relating, as ends rather than means, to oneself, to significant others, to human beings in general, to other species, to nature, and to the cosmos” So how do you create a life purpose? Gaining clarity about yourself, what matters most to you and what would be meaningful to you. How do you figure out? Well, by asking yourself the right questions and thinking about them. These questions might be something like: “What do I value?”, “What am I good at?”, “What interests me?”, “Where do I find meaning?”, “What are the things I want to do before I die?”, “What do I want others to say about me at my funeral?” “What value do I want to contribute back to the world”? In our busy, hectic daily lives it is often difficult to find the time to think about questions like these. So you inevitably have to make time for them. A good way is to create a commitment by blocking a time slot in your calendar, say one hour every Sunday, just for pondering these questions and thinking. As soon as you get some clarity about these questions (full clarity does not have to be achieved yet), you can establish some kind of long-term vision of how you want your life to look like in the distant future and principles/values you want to live by. Then, take action. Try different career lanes and different projects and see if you resonate with them. Make sure to regularly reflect on these questions and if your current live situations do satisfy them.

The truth is, this just cannot be known. Folks who use a firearm to resolve a potentially criminal situation without firing the gun, seldom report the incident, for fear of unexpected, negative repercussions. I know of a couple of potentially criminal incidents that were ended without the firearm even being presented. The stalkers (can’t call them attackers at this point) were simply made aware of the presence of a firearm. This is just as surely a defensive gun use, as actually presenting the weapon. Since these events never get reported, how can we quantify them? This topic has interested researchers enough that many went to great expense to conduct polls. Surely not the most reliable measure, but just as surely, the only possible way get a sense of just how often firearms are used to stop crime. One poll would not be very revealing, but multiple polls could give us a reasonably accurate sense of the question… the more the better. As it happens we actually do have quite a number of polls asking just this question… Examining the graph, we can see that the most conservative average is, that firearms are used to stop crime about 1.4 million times per year, or almost 5 times as often as firearms are used to commit crimes. Edit 230221: I ran a across recent pertinent information I would like to include. In 2021, Professor William English Conducted the 2021, National Firearms Survey, the most comprehensive ever research on firearms in America, which was published in 2022 by, Georgetown University McDonough School of Business. Unsurprisingly Professor English’s findings were consistent with the above graph… Consistent with other recent survey research, the survey finds an overall rate of adult firearm ownership of 31.9%, suggesting that in excess of 81.4 million Americans aged 18 and over own firearms. The survey further finds that approximately a third of gun owners (31.1%) have used a firearm to defend themselves or their property, often on more than one occasion, and it estimates that guns are used defensively by firearms owners in approximately 1.67 million incidents per year. Handguns are the most common firearm employed for self-defense (used in 65.9% of defensive incidents), and in most defensive incidents (81.9%) no shot was fired. Approximately a quarter (25.2%) of defensive incidents occurred within the gun owner's home, and approximately half (53.9%) occurred outside their home, but on their property. About one out of ten (9.1%) defensive gun uses occurred in public, and about one out of twenty (4.8%) occurred at work. [LINKED_TEXT: 2021 National Firearms SurveyAbstract This report summarizes the findings of a national survey of firearms ownership and use conducted between February 17th and March 23rd, 2021 by the professional survey firm Centiment. This survey, which is part of a larger book project, aims to provide the most comprehensive assessment of firearms ownership and use patterns in America to date. This online survey was administered to a representative sample of approximately fifty-four thousand U.S. residents aged 18 and over, and it identified 16,708 gun owners who were, in turn, asked in-depth questions about their ownership and their use of firearms, including defensive uses of firearms. Consistent with other recent survey research, the survey finds an overall rate of adult firearm ownership of 31.9%, suggesting that in excess of 81.4 million Americans aged 18 and over own firearms. The survey further finds that approximately a third of gun owners (31.1%) have used a firearm to defend themselves or their property, often on more than one occasion, and it estimates that guns are used defensively by firearms owners in approximately 1.67 million incidents per year. Handguns are the most common firearm employed for self-defense (used in 65.9% of defensive incidents), and in most defensive incidents (81.9%) no shot was fired. Approximately a quarter (25.2%) of defensive incidents occurred within the gun owner's home, and approximately half (53.9%) occurred outside their home, but on their property. About one out of ten (9.1%) defensive gun uses occurred in public, and about one out of twenty (4.8%) occurred at work. A majority of gun owners (56.2%) indicate that they carry a handgun for self-defense in at least some circumstances, and about 35% of gun owners report carrying a handgun with some frequency. We estimate that approximately 20.7 million gun owners (26.3%) carry a handgun in public under a \`\`concealed carry'' regime; and 34.9% of gun owners report that there have been instances in which they had wanted to carry a handgun for self-defense, but local rules did not allow them to carry. The average gun owner owns 5 firearms, and handguns are the most common type of firearm owned. 48.0% of gun owners have owned magazines that hold over 10 rounds, and 30.2% of gun owners -- totaling about 24.6 million individuals -- have owned an AR-15 or similarly styled rifle. Demographically, gun owners are diverse. 42.2% are female and 57.8% are male. Approximately 25.4% of Blacks own firearms, 28.3% of Hispanics own firearms, 19.4% of Asians own firearms, and 34.3% of Whites own firearms.https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3887145#] [URL: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3887145]"},{"prompt":"w quickly would the world end if all rain became hydrochloric acid?","completion":"first of all,all rain,everywhere,in oceans,rivers,channels at the same time???"},{"prompt":"Are Yamaha motorcycles reliable for a new biker?","completion":"I think Yamaha bikes are the best and most well built bikes.

Aloe vera gel is known for its hydrating and soothing properties, which can help to calm irritated skin and reduce inflammation. If you have sensitive skin, you may want to dilute the aloe vera gel with water before applying it to your face, or look for a product that contains a lower concentration of aloe vera. Additionally, if you're using a store-bought aloe vera gel, make sure to check the ingredients list to ensure that there are no added irritants or chemicals that could potentially harm your skin. It's important to note that while aloe vera gel is generally safe to use on the face, it's not a cure-all for all skin concerns, and you should always consult with a dermatologist if you have any persistent skin issues or concerns."},{"prompt":"What are the qualities of a successful leader?","completion":"A ‘good leader’ in what area of life? A good leader in war is one that can mislead a group of people to believe that the greater good over-rules individual good for both sides. The leaders soldiers should be willing to die and they should be willing to kill. A good leader in business (for the business owner) finds the top 20% of performers and fires the lower 80%. A good leader in religion is able to create a belief among followers that they are weak and unworthy - but have a sliver of hope if they have faith in what that religion teaches. A good leader in education (for the institution) produces the largest possible financial gain for their organization under the guise that degrees are what makes the world go around. A good leader in government (for one party) is the one that can hold power even when they only have a minority support. A good leader on a hike is one who can read the limitations of people in their group in order to keep them safe while providing a great experience. A good leader as a Human Being is a person that sees each person for the perfection that they are. They create the space for people to become their personal best. We can choose to be led by the needs and greed of government, religion, education or business or we can choose to follow our own gut instinct that we are all born with. ‘Good’ leaders are defined by the number of followers but that doesn’t speak about the quality of the followers. Is there such a thing as a good follower - beyond the reverse definition of each class of good leader? For example a good follower in war is prepared to kill and to die. For a person that becomes their personal best, are they a follower or have they become a leader in their own right? In that case a good leader is one who expands and strengthens diversity of leadership. It could be argued that a follower in war is a leader of sorts. The question is whether war is natural or unnatural. For the answer we look at nature. Does war exist in nature where tribes of a species seek to kill each other? That is unnatural. it doesn’t exist. So with war being an activity that goes against nature, so to, the leaders and followers are engaged in an unnatural activity that is allowed through free will. The real question could be what makes a good leader bad or good?

Many Pakistanis here are cherry picking bad pictures of Bangladesh and good ones of Pakistan. Forgetting that both nations have different demographics and people plus the land area and density. Truth: Bangladesh has better economy than Pakistan, better currency than Pakistan. Pakistan’s infrastructure may slightly be better than Bangladesh’s because while Bangladesh was part of West Pakistan, they looted the resources and used it to modernize West Pakistan, not the East. After independence Bangladesh had to build itself from the scratch. Pakistan gained independence 72 years ago; while Bangladesh gained independence 48 years ago. There has been a drastic improvements in Bangladesh since then; while there are many internal tensions in Pakistan. Bangladesh as a nation is under construction. So one can’t assume which is better and which isn’t. Both countries are at different level. Bangladesh and Pakistan has their own good sides and bad sides. Only the ultra nationalists will show the good side of their own and the bad side of other nation. For couple of years now Pakistan is doing really bad, their currency has taken a dip and their entire Nominal GDP is reducing or in stagnant position. On top of the debts of Pakistan covers a huge chuck of their entire GDP , hence little money left to spend on social welfare. Plus, the inflation rate is high hence the value of PKR is going down, which is taking effects on their GDP. On the other hand, Bangladesh managed to handle it’s money properly, stable inflation and less external debts. Down Below are the stats of each country: Pakistan Area: 881,913 km² Population Density: 255.3 people per square kilometer (661.1/mi2) Bangladesh Area: 147,570 km² Population Density: 1,115.62 per square kilometer,(2,889.45/square mile), Pakistan currency is lot weaker than Bangladesh. Pakistani Rupee is in a free fall. You can see below: Bangladesh maintains highest gender equality in South Asia , ranking 48th. Way ahead of India as well. Bangladesh government promotes gender equality and encourages women to join the workforce alongside men. Bangladesh government spent its money on social welfare such as on building better infrastructure and providing good education. Even in the Literacy rate Bangladesh is higher; Bangladesh: 73% and Pakistan: 58%. This way people, regardless of gender and class, can get their education and help to move the wheel of Bangladesh’s economy. Bangladesh’s population was higher than Pakistan, but now you can look below: Pakistan population: 216 million (2019) Bangladesh population: 163 million (2019) So to those Pakistanis, who is busy saying progress in Bangladesh isn’t as significant and all that let me tell you sincerely that Bangladesh introduced birth control methods as early as 1980s, within few years after independence. Population of Bangladesh and Pakistan in 1970 were: Bangladesh has fewer population than Pakistan + life expectancy rate is higher + lower fertility rate than of Pakistan. So admit it, that even after being independent for 70 years, you guys aren’t doing so well. Whereas Bangladesh who gained Independence from Pakistan 48 years ago doing so well. Life Expectancy Pakistan: 67.79 years (2019) Life Expectancy Bangladesh: 73.57 years (2019) Coming to natural beauties of each countries. Both has their beautiful places. That’s something not to brag about, its all made by the mother nature and not by the people themselves. So it is better to respect the nature regardless where it is located. Here are some beautiful places of both nations. Pakistan: Naltar valley Neelum Valley, Azad Kashmir Gojal Valley Bangladesh: Jaflong, Sylhet.

Firstly, physical appearance and strength are not always the most important factors for success in military operations. Elite soldiers and Navy SEALs undergo rigorous training programs focusing on functional fitness and endurance rather than just building muscle mass. They must be able to perform various tasks, such as carrying heavy gear, running long distances, and swimming through difficult conditions, which require different training than bodybuilding. Secondly, elite soldiers and Navy SEALs undergo training designed to help them perform their jobs effectively and efficiently rather than bulk up. Having too much muscle mass can sometimes hinder their line of work, as it can reduce their flexibility and agility, which are important for navigating difficult terrain and executing complex maneuvers. Finally, it's important to remember that genetics also influence how our bodies respond to training. While some people can easily build large amounts of muscle mass, others may need help achieving the same results, even with the same amount of training and nutrition.

Later, I left BBN to set up a non-profit, which had a 10 year run (actually, it still exists, just not active) - and when it was time to wind things up, I put out an email letting former colleagues know I was available. Six months later, I got a call saying “the guy we hired for <position> didn’t work out, are you still available” - and I ended up there for a few years. Basically, if I had gotten pretty far in the hiring process for a position, was reasonably sympatico with the people, didn’t make it, and was still interested & available 4 months later - sure… I’d make call and make a pitch. Then again, if all I’d done was through my name in the hopper, and not make it past a phone screen, then I wouldn’t bother.

For example the double decker taco didn't used to be on the Taco Bell menu. I love it with nacho cheese, not beans. It was made popular by employees who obviously get tired of eating the same things for lunch every day. Not every employee will ring up something weird for you; some of them have no imagination.

What is the highest wind speed in which a plane can land?","completion":"There is no single maximum wind limit, as it depends on wind direction and flight phase. A crosswind of over 40 mph and a tailwind of over 10 mph can start to cause problems and stop commercial aircraft from taking off and landing. A crosswind can be very dangerous during takeoffs and landings. An angle formed between the wind and the center line of the runway is defined as a crosswind. And there are limits to that component, as well as to tailwinds. Each aircraft has its own established crosswind limitations. Consequently, the maximum acceptable crosswind component is 25 knots. An aircraft has its own movement force, which will always be affected by the wind component regardless of the size or weight of the aircraft , the difference will be the speed with which it moves and therefore the time that the wind affects its movement. motion. For a takeoff or landing to be done safely, the ideal is for the wind to be calm, with a headwind or with a very weak tailwind. While crosswinds or tailwinds can limit maneuvers and be dangerous, since they can move the aircraft sideways and cause instability and loss of control. One of the wind components that pose the greatest risk during takeoff or landing maneuvers is the so-called crosswind, which is perpendicular to the runway and directly affects the direction of the aircraft. During these maneuvers, crosswinds can occur in the form of gusts, gusts, or shear. Being able to generate abrupt and sudden changes, excess speed safety margins and an alteration in the aircraft's ability to accelerate and climb or reduce and descend. Being, therefore, more dangerous the closer to the ground they occur. Aircraft, according to the characteristics given by their manufacturers, have a limitation regarding the crosswind that they can face when landing, which can go, on average, between 25 km/h to 55 km/h.

So with that in tow and for the fact they pull their shit of trying to turn you into the ideal person as if that movie titled stepford wives, or the other the husband of stepford. The worse I saw was a middle aged female, she had fainted it was a co Ed ward the nursing staff left her laying on the floor walked right around her as if she wasn't even there, those fuckers did not even check her vitals. I COULDN'T BELIEVE THEY DID THAT. So what I did being the loving and compassionate male I am, even towards total strangers, I approached 2 other male patients and requested their help to get her off the floor and into her bed, we got screamed at by one really mouthy nurse to which she was instructed to SHUT THE FUCK UP BEFORE WE SHUT YOU THE FUCK UP. And we got the patient who fainted in her bed and all tucked in. When she came to about an hour and a half later she was confused a little, asked the nurses what happened to which them dumbass dickwads losers didn't say a word. We told her come on over and sit with us, we'll tell you what happened and who all was involved. The other really bad thing was they dragged some male into this locked room it was always locked, me being nosey when someone did enter it I saw it had no bed or furniture in it. They chained him to the floor and left him there, MY GOD he was sitting with the rest of us watching TV he didn't even so much as saying boo to anybody. Afterwards male nurses would enter one always stood at the door when it was unlocked, and we heard cries of pain coming from that room. What was going on, the nurses were kicking the life out of him, kicking him in his side, his crotch even in his head, when he passed out from the pain out the nurses came and the door was locked.

This would save the money and make things easier than having to paint or remake uniforms and equipment every time they pick a new war. Those nice desert tan vehicles don’t blend very well in green areas any more than green blends in the desert. The problem is, as every grunt knows, the area you are in changes ever few klicks. Plants die. You have to work to stay hidden. So, what works in one area probably won’t work in another that changes altitude or humidity. Even in Vietnam, were the ERDL pattern was developed, we had two variants. Highland and lowland. The lowland was more green as it was more lush. Where I live, we can go from summer with ERDLl to fall with ERDLh and then Alpenflage to a nice brown in winter if not white based. The foliage changes with the seasons. If I go 100 miles north, it changes, just like south. Even in the same season, I can go from woods to fields, towns, and more, all requiring different changes in camo to blend in.

And you might already know that have so many forms and types, such as pure perfume, cologne, and eau de toilette, etc. Sounds exciting right, but have you ever wondered what’s the difference between these forms and types? Well, all fragrances are almost the same when it comes to the texture, but they’re slightly different based on the concentration and consumption of oil in alcohol and water. Well, so many experts explain that “the fragrance” is a term for the use of Unisex purpose, and any smell that contains a certain amount of oil in alcohol and water. For Example- The difference between Cologne, Perfume and Eau de toilette 1. Cologne (eau de cologne) – It is an ancient term to describe Eau De Cologne and the oldest term for perfume, often used for masculine fragrances. The smell is very subtle, fresh and florescent, typically contains two to four percent of oils in alcohol and water. 2. Toilette (eau de toilette) – It is relatively lighter than the other perfumes and colognes, it is a version of a scent that contains a lower percentage of fragrant essential oils than Eau de parfum and cologne. 3. Perfume (Eau de parfum) –This form of fragrance is genderless, and it is often used to describe both men’s and women’s scents which are [LINKED_TEXT: unisex fragrances] [URL: https://www.perfumebooth.com/unisex-perfume]. Usually, it contains about 15 – 20 percent of pure fragrance essence and it lasts for about four to seven hours. 4. Perfume –This one is the most concentrated and expensive of all the other options.

His decision was utterly idiotic from all possible points of view. It killed thousands of well paying jobs on both sides of the border. It angered Canada and caused major political problems for Canadian liberals including Crime Minister Trudeau. It increases imports of heavy oil from Russia and Venezuela to the expense of American families. So why would “President” Biden do something that stupid? What does he gain from a lose-lose situation? Surprise!!! “Caring Joe\\" did it for dirty, capitalist money. As it stands, for the lack of pipeline, the oil will have to be shipped by RAIL. And who invested heavily in the railways to profit from that? One Warren Buffett. So, screw the American families, screw the environment (railways are a lot more environmentally harmful than pipelines), screw nation's strategic implications!!! As long as Warren Buffett is making money and sharing in his “good fortune\\" with the Democrats. That will also bring us to the larger question, ie. why big corporations support the Democrats rather than the Republicans - an apparent paradox? Simple answer. The Republicans support free competition and competitive economy ultimately benefitting the American consumer. The bigger the corporation, the more it hates competition and strives for monopoly, so it can rip off the consumers. That is why corporations support Democrats. They figured out long time ago, that the Democrats are more corrupt than a hooker on the street corner, hence much cheaper to buy and own and if you grease them properly, they will sell their own country. Just ask comrade Xi why he greased the Biden family to the expense of America.

Unfortunately this is such weak evidence that it is as good as no evidence at all … possibly worse (since it potentially undermines the authority of their religion to use the book that way). Therefore it is known as “no evidence”. BY comparison there is plenty of evidence that human reproduction emerged from a general population over time. By the time there were identifiable distinct H.sapiens, there was likely a breeding population in the millions. The way evolution and species works the ancestral chains looks like this: If you were to line up your mother, and her mother, and so on in a long line … you would eventually end up with an animal clearly not a human. Most people get this part … it’s the next part that gives people trouble, vis: There was no disjoint moment where a non-human mother gave birth to a human daughter. At every single individual along the line, mother and daughter to that individual are the same species. You can see it by analogy with a color gradient. Open up your favorite image editor (Photoshop, The GIMP, whatever) and use the gradient tool to make a bar starting with red at one end and blue at the other end. If you zoom in to the individual pixels anywhere on the gradient… pick a pixel… the pixels to either side of it are the same color, yet the pixels at each end are clearly very different colors."},{"prompt":"Do they have stereotypical American food restaurants in other countries, and do they serve any American foods that aren't actual American?","completion":"Not counting fast food, yes.

Strength training exercises can help build muscle and improve overall body composition.Facial exercises: While not scientifically proven to specifically target face fat, facial exercises may help tone the muscles in your face, potentially giving a more defined appearance.

If you’re on Texas State Highway 130, where the posted speed is 85 mph, or you’re driving on a road in Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, or Wyoming where the posted speed is 80 mph, it probably wouldn’t be any different than any other speeding ticket.

I have never had restaurant ramen, nor been to Japan to try it at a ramen shop there, so my choices are experiments I have done at home with various ramen packs. When using the Nissen Ramen I prefer the Oriental flavor, but use half the packet at most. I will add some broth mix, or Miso, then add some seasoning like rice or black vinegar, or some chili oil or other pepper sauce. I also like adding Schezhuan peppers for it's taste and tingle. I may add Terriyaki sauce, soy sauce, or hoison sauce depending on the flavor I want. The toppings mostly depends on what I have available. I rarely have roast pork but one time has an extra country style pork ribs that I sliced and put on top. Carrot sticks are a good choice, but I am not a fan of eggs so much, so I haven't put boiled egg on it, but want to try it with medium boiled egg, still sort of runny yolk. One thing I do at times is use the noodles with half the broth, some peanut butter, and Terriyaki sauce, topped with sesame seed to make a variation on sesame noodles. I recently found an Asian grocery that I can find different oils, sauces, vinegars and spices, there I found a selection of satay peanut sauces I use instead of just peanut butter. I think it is Thai, so it gives an extra kick. To me Ramen is like pizza, it is just the base for the final product. You can put on most anything you like."},{"prompt":"w can I learn a dance?

Exciting yet nerve-wracking, right? Well, here are a few tips to help you navigate that potentially awkward but hopeful encounter. First things first, be yourself! Yeah, I know it sounds cliché, but it's true. Pretending to be someone you're not won't get you very far. Plus, who wants to start a relationship based on lies? Next, remember to relax and have fun. It's natural to feel a bit anxious, but try not to let it consume you. Enjoy the experience, laugh, and let your genuine personality shine through. And speaking of shining, don't forget to dress comfortably and appropriately. Be stylish if you want, but also consider the venue and the activities planned. Communication is key, my friend. Talk, listen, and show interest in your date. Ask questions, share stories, and find common ground. Remember, it's a two-way street, so let them speak too. Oh, and please put your phone away. Nothing screams disinterest more than constantly checking your messages or social media feeds. Now, don't worry about trying to impress your date with extravagant gestures or an over-the-top dinner. Keep it simple and focus on building a connection. A cozy coffee shop or a casual stroll in the park can work wonders. And hey, if the conversation is flowing smoothly, feel free to suggest extending the date with another activity like grabbing dinner or catching a movie. Lastly, be respectful and considerate. Treat your date with kindness and show good manners. Open doors, offer compliments, and be mindful of their boundaries. Oh, and don't forget to follow up afterward with a text or call to let them know you had a great time. It's a small gesture that can go a long way in making a lasting impression. So, there you have it! Just be yourself, relax, communicate, and have a good time. Remember, the ultimate goal is to enjoy each other's company and see if there's a spark worth pursuing. Good luck, my friend!"},{"prompt":"Was the Galactic Empire in Star Wars the largest and most powerful empire in scifi?","completion":"No, not even close. The clue is in the name GALACTIC ie a galaxy.

I’d wanted one for a very long time and had read all I could put my hands on, which wasn’t a lot before the internet! If I knew then what I know now I realize what a poor choice this was, especially for a first dog. We learned a lot together and determination of future pet adoptions were based upon that learning. Because she was pure bred, her breeder required I wait until she had her first cycle before I could spay her in case he decided he wanted to breed her. I won’t ever do that again. Always spay your females before their first cycle. Her behavior immediately after her spay did something weird to her hormones and brought out her Alpha behavior in many ways. I won’t bore you with the details. Huskies need exercise. A LOT of exercise. Destructive behavior ensues when your dog is bored or not “worn out” from exercise, This is exemplified 10x over with a Husky. Digging, tearing up shoes, eating underwear, biting a hole in the waterbed (!). If an Alpha Husky growls, it will bite. Let it growl. We thought teaching her not to growl would stop the snap-biting. It just made her snap without warning. My son got nailed twice, me once. (Some would say that would be the end of the dog. Our pets are family members.) Huskies are bred to run, and run hard. They will take any dog siblings with them that will go, and they don’t stop. We lived near the university sheep pastures at the time. A sign gave strong warning that “at large dogs would be shot on sight”. It was imperative we keep her fenced. I was always scared to death they’d escape and get shot. Fortunately that didn’t happen, although it so easily could have. Once we had to pay a fine and pick her up from the Humane Society. Many trials of fencing (a VERY large yard) failed until we put electrical wire at the top and bottom of the fence (who knew a dog would CLIMB a fence!). Worked great, except…enter a contractor that leaves the gate open. The last time she and her adopted sibling (Husky/Heeler mix, go figure) got out, we were driving out of state and had left them in the care of my daughter and boyfriend. Thankfully after hours of worrying, we got the call that they had been caught about 5 miles from home. We eventually moved out of state, installed a buried electrical fence that worked very well. (Side note: People, if you install an underground electrical fence TRAIN your dogs and train them well!) Best solution ever. I wouldn’t give up the years I had with this beautiful creature. She became the coolest, most mellow old lady and lived to be 16 years old. But she sure was a challenge for a first dog."},{"prompt":"US wars after 9/11, who is on the losing end, the West or the Muslim terrorists?","completion":"The Bushes (owe their wealth to the Saudis) set the US up to defend the biggest enemy of the west and freedom of expression.

What are some of the main factors that allowed the Empire to become so vast?","completion":"Ok the main reasons Britain had the largest empire the world has ever known. Britain, traditionally on the edge of the known world, was a technologically backward, damp group of islands that nobody was concerned about. Populated by barbarian tribes that had nothing to do, but farm and kill each other over an insult or land or inheritence laws for most of its history.Because britain was isolated, poor, backward damp and the people that lived there fought each other over nothing, the catholic church had little authority over the kings, leading to prodestantism, and an influx of educated men whom held ideals that opposed some of the ideals of the church. That created a culture of learning not for the sake of learning like the Greeks, but learning about God’s creation for the sake of gloryfying Christ.The British had always been divided, which made them good fighters always at war with each other. (The only thing the white man has ever been better at then anyone else at is killing each other over stupid reasons. No empire has ever controlled all of europe, and noone has built an empire that controlled most of europe for any longer then a few years)The British were poor, they were slow to send ships to the new world. They couldnt afford it. Scotland is actually a part of the UK today because their attempts at a colony in the Americas failed and sent them broke. England bailed out the Scottish economy in return for Union. The English beginings of colonialism in the new world was piracy. They raided Spainish colonies and treasure fleets.Because they were slow to set up colonies, poor, had a different approach to education, were distracted with politics within the British isles they were able to watch what and how other powers set up and ran colonies, and profited from them.The British set colonies up for profit. The government or parliment had nothing to do with it. Parliment allow corporations and private enterprise do the colonizing not the state. Politicians, Lords, and even the Crown invested in these companies and enterprises. Men like Francis Drake and William Jardine, invested and became politicians after successful enterprises.India was conquered by a corporation not the British army or the Royal navy. That act made Britain rich, which paid for more ships for war and trade which led to world domination."},{"prompt":"Who are some of the big hearted citizens of India?","completion":"SindhuTai She adopted 1042 children.

In the early months, as your baby's immune system develops, you'll want to use the mildest cleansers and the smallest bit of lotion. But when dry skin, eczema, and diaper rash appear, it's time to treat those problems. Talk to your pediatrician about when to start using those products. Your newborn needs dye-free, fragrance-free baby skin care products. Read labels carefully. Baby skin care products that contain dyes, fragrances, and chemicals can irritate a baby's skin and breathing. Natural baby skin care products are safe for most infants. But if you have allergies or asthma in your family, your newborn may also be sensitive to botanicals and herbs in some products. The label hypoallergenic can be misleading. The term means that the product is less likely to cause an allergic reaction, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the product is gentler on the skin than other products. Look for products that are phthalate- and paraben-free. Those chemicals are potentially harmful to babies. Cleansers and washes are mild and safe for newborns. But use baby soaps sparingly, as they can dry newborn skin. Helps moisturize newborn skin. Use sparingly on tiny newborns. Can be used to treat diaper rash. It provides baby's skin with a protective barrier against moist diapers. You may be asked to apply it to the healing circumcision site.

If your supermarket doesn’t carry it it’s likely because the store doesn’t think anyone will buy it. It’s notably more expensive than peanut butter (because cashews are more expensive)."},{"prompt":"Would Hillary Clinton have made a better President than Donald J Trump?","completion":"Don Trump was rated the worst president in American history by the Political Science Association in their respected survey. As a nazi-praising, tariff-raising, anti-NATO, anti-American president, he set the bar as low as it could go. He’s a president who largely did nothing while 500,000 Americans died of Covid—except pretend there was no such thing as Covid. As a leader and a person, Mr. Trump is somewhat of an abomination. Could Clinton Do Better? Could Mrs. Clinton do better than ‘the worst’? It’s unlikely she would do worse. She understood how the U.S. gov’t worked. She had foreign policy experience. She was sensitive to the challenges of children and the poor. She practiced etiquette and had a sense of decency. In these things, she was positioned to be a better leader, better steward, and to better serve the country. So, of course, she had the intellect and temperament to do better. Easily so. Would she be successful? That’s different though than saying she would have been successful. With the exception of Don Trump, she was the most negatively viewed politician in America. I think if she would have won—she would have faced unprecedented challenges including some form of obstruction and disinformation: The senate, led by Sen. McConnell, was prepared to block her agenda—just as he had done against Mr. ObamaShe would have had a hard time confirming judges to the Supreme Court.With GOP majorities in both houses of congress, she would have had a VERY difficult time passing significant legislation Having Said That There ARE things she would have accomplished: Stronger NATO: Trump divided NATO and the U.S.’s standing across the world plummeted. Clinton would have worked better with foreign allies.Russia faces consequences: Russia DID tamper with our elections. If elected, Clinton would have called them out and punished them. Not bowed down at their feet. She would have also had the world’s support (See #1)Different tariff policy: Clinton’s tariff policy would have likely been different. Tariffs are paid for by Americans in the form of higher prices for goods/services. Clinton would have saved each U.S. family about 1,000/year.Covid: While there’s no way to say that Clinton would have reacted faster, she would not have pretended Covid didn’t exist either. I think we can say that the U.S. response would have been more coordinated, less expensive (agencies not bidding against each other), and we would have provided more leadership worldwide. Trump gets credit for developing the vaccines…but otherwise, his Covid response was a failure and is largely the reason he lost re-electionNo praising Nazis: Clinton would not have excused Nazi behavior. Nor stoked it. As a result, many of hate groups (Proud Boys etc.) would be much less powerful and less a threat to the countryFunctioning Gov’t: Trump left many vacancies in many departments…basically crippling them and making them unable to function. Most notably, the U.S. Post Office, the I.R.S. and the State Department. Clinton would not have impaired basic government functionLess Corruption/Graft: No administration is corruption-free, but Don Trump’s was the most corrupt in our history…by far. Along with his family’s self-dealing, he had the most corrupt campaign staff, the most corrupt cabinet, and the most corrupt administration. Worse than Nixon. Many went to jail, were forced to resign, or were ethical failures. Trump’s family used the positions for personal profit.Less disinformation: Clinton would have faced disinformation from Fox and Facebook…but she would not have stoked it, energized it, and made authoritarianism a tool in the playbook.More stable America: If Clinton had won in ‘16, much of the destabilization of our country by Trump (Jan. 6 and the anti-democracy members of the GOP) would not exist…or at the very least been delayed by 10 years or so.Better immigration: For 20 years, America had its lowest levels of immigration into the country. Then Trump lied about there being a crisis and set up detainment camps…Unnecessary. With Clinton, immigration is actually dealt with—more effectively and without traumatizing kids and embarrassing the nation Verdict Much of Clinton’s positives would have been addition by subtraction. Maybe she doesn’t have a ton of legislative or judicial accomplishments, but she does help the country side-step the disaster that was Don Trump. She was competent, knew and respected our history, and would have strengthened our foreign relationships. She’s not perfect. According to reports, she can be indecisive and vindictive. She was despised by many in the GOP. Many would not have liked her. But I think she would have benefitted the health of the U.S. public and our gov’t, too, been competent, and actually served the country."},{"prompt":"Aren’t you upset seeing a tattoo all over Jungkook’s arm?","completion":"No. I have better things to be concerned about."},{"prompt":"w can you stop a car if someone cuts the brakes?","completion":"Either your parking brake or engine braking. In the event your brakes are cut without you knowing somehow, you'll want to downshift and apply the parking brake but not all the way or you can lock up the rear tires unintentionally. If you're driving a manual then you know how to downshift but in an automatic, look at the options on your gear lever. On my Ford Ranger, I've got P, R, D, 2, 1. Some will have a 3 or maybe even a 4 additionally. If you are going like 40–50 mph and you realize the brakes don't work, pop the gear lever into 2 and slowly apply the e brake, you'll slow down faster than you think. When the revs get too low, pop it into 1 and give it more e brake and hopefully you'll stop in time. Good luck to you if that happens."},{"prompt":"What are some tips for me if I am new to competitive programming?","completion":"If you are a beginner and you have just started learning basic Data Structures and Algorithms then this answer is for you. Most people out there will begin answering this question by telling you to make an account in Codechef, Codeforces, or some other platform. It’s okay to some extent but definitely, it won’t help you in the long run if you are an average guy. Let me summarise all the steps and precautions that you should always keep in mind: Choosing a language is an independent decision, but for competitive coding, it’s better if you go with C++ or Java.As a beginner, your whole emphasis should be on LEARNING and PRACTICE. You should participate in CONTESTS only when you are done with your milestones for LEARNING and PRACTICE.You must keep in mind that throughout your CP career you need to maintain a ratio for LEARNING TIME, PRACTICE TIME, and CONTEST TIME. The order would be:LEARNING TIME >= PRACTICE TIME > CONTEST TIME (Beginner)LEARNING TIME = PRACTICE TIME >= CONTEST TIME (Intermediate)LEARNING TIME < PRACTICE TIME <= CONTEST TIME (Advanced) There are numerous youtube channels that will definitely help you in your learning progress. It’s recommended that you learn through watching videos as it will provide faster progress.For beginners, it’s strongly recommended that you start practicing from HackerRank. HackerRank has a very user-friendly UI. You only have to implement the function that will do the job you have been asked. Although, you should avoid sticking to HackerRank for much longer. As soon as you think that you have conquered the fear of writing codes and got comfortable with your thought processing, you should stop using it. You should visit it when you learn a new concept and want to implement it.Now it’s time to focus on practicing. GFG and Leetcode are highly recommended places for practicing. GFG is the encyclopedia for competitive coders and Leetcode contains almost every standard question that you will face while learning DS and Algorithms. Although you can practice on CodeChef, Codeforces, or wherever you want. You should also start participating in contests by now, but keeping the following points in mind.Always try to read and try developing an approach at least if not the complete solution for every problem in the contest.Go through the editorials after every contest. It’s really important because it will help you in developing the skill of reducing a complex problem into a simple problem.If you are not able to understand the solution, then there are numerous YouTubers who stream their solutions. Refer to those videos. In the end, it’s all about practice. It’s about how much familiar you make yourselves to the question so that when you see a familiar question next time, you would be able to recognize it. If you think that Competetive Coding is all about developing your logic and problem-solving ability then you are wrong, it’s a lot about memorizing the type of the question and developing the ability to identify when you see a similar one again. And you can develop that only by practice and facing varieties of different problems."},{"prompt":"What are some examples of arguments against the existence of an afterlife?","completion":"How can you argue faith?"},{"prompt":"What is the most horrible thing you have seen while in a mental hospital?","completion":"A 14-year old child hung herself from the shower rod with a bed sheet.

The bathrooms were supposed to be locked and we had to ask the staff to unlock the door and we could only bring in a see-through basket w a small towel, comb, shampoo and our toothbrush when showering. Apparently the staff left the door unlocked and on this tiny unit this 14-year old girl smuggled a large bed sheet into the bathroom and hung herself. I mean, wtf. I had been up there for severe self-harm and they wouldn’t even let me pee or shower without someone actually in the bathroom watching. But she goes in w a BEDSHEET and commits suicide. They had this whole funeral for her (maybe a celebration of life thing bc obviously her family had their own funeral) and all i remember thinking thru the whole thing was how stupid and false it all seemed.

Will I die or severely hurt myself if I smoke cannabis while on 30mg of Vyvanse?","completion":"Yes, it’s gonna make you feel really good. Too good, it can be (extremely) addictive, if the amphetamine is still active, so avoid weed when youre drinking and peaking when on vyvanse or adderall as that can lead to a rocky road. If it does help your sleep and adhd symptoms, a slow therapy can help, as you build a light tolerance and that can counteract addiction, since the “high” isn’t as euphoric. it works extremely well with alcohol too, a peak with adderall/vyvanse, cannabis and alcohol can cause intense euphoria as it synthezises and builds a triangle-like high. Be cautious with it, the shit is just too good. It’s probably not far of what meth would feel like. (im just guessing, but it’s probably comparable) Meth is the most addictive substance on earth, for many people, it even beats heroin once youre into it and youre creating a comparable feeling. I’d imagine it works something like this: Vyvanse can’t reach peak-levels comparable to meth, which is why it’s so much less dangerous. (aderall CAN and works faster, which is why i think it should only be used for heavy adhd but what do i know) With weed, i’d imagine that “protection” goes straight out the window, due to intense dopamine-blood-levels, especially when combined with alcohol. Be prepared to be so addicted that you potentially cant stop using for years. Weed is extremely strong when destroying thought loops, as it makes you feel extremely numb, but still conscious, a feeling of all your negative emotions being completely numbed, which is also an intensely addictive thing. it can make you feel MUCH number than alocohol can even at relatively high dosages and if you combine the two. Alcohol makes you forget everything, but weed+alcohol makes you remember the intense eophoria and numbnessness, carelessnes to all your deepest worries. My god, don’t do it. It’s just way too good. I haven’t smoked in years and i still deeply, honestly very much so miss the feeling, as it truly can treat and even cure adhd like nothing else can.

Not even my so called best friend. I was always considered the odd one out. The main reason was jealousy and arrogance towards me. And it increased after SOTY trophy! So, I left school with no actual friends, who used to show that they are my friends. . And I know as I have seen this normally, one day when you actually become successful and big, people start needing you or maybe the financial help from you. The same faces who turned their back, now are ready to kneel down! Actual success brings a lot of people around you. Because you start earning money and fame when you are adult and successful! And that what matters more than anything. . The only advice I would like to give is, In your teenage don’t be so mean to someone better that you. The person you left in jealousy or arrogance Can be the same person who could have been you best friend forever. Can be the same person from whom you’ll have to ask help in need. Can be the same person who can be so heartless that they will not even recognize you. Teenage is pretty normal stage to be jealous of someone better than you, but don’t ruin friendships.

It can be difficult to account for all these factors in making your decision about which school or type of school is best for your child. Many parents want to send their children to private schools but are afraid that they won't get a good education. This is a bit confusing as most people don't know the difference between public and private schools. There has been much comparison about private schools and public schools, whether it be the teachers, education system or the curriculum. Private schools are very useful in improving a child's grades with various levels of difficulty from math to history classes. For decades, many families have chosen to send their children to private school. Some choose to do so for financial reasons, others for the extra curricular activities.

You can advertise most of the weapons as this tells the other side that Ukraine is supported amd loved and that they are not… You let the world know so that any country thinking about it also join in.. everyone loves a winner… You tell the world about it because people need hope. Those soldiers fighting on in Mariupol? They hear about these weapons and they know that they play a vital role, so they fight on because they know that in the end they are better than the other side and that their lives actually matter. But, some weapons you keep quiet about… you advertise enough that the other side should fear what else has been given.. they have satellites, they can see the trains and the tanks and the artillery pieces and the crates and the trucks. But, they cannot see inside the crates or the trucks… So, they know about the Switchblades and they know that they generals and colonels are dead men walking.

We pray constantly for something to happen, or to be given or relieved of something but the answers don’t seem forthcoming; “I keep praying and God is not answering my prayers” is a common theme among growing Christians, and it’s vital that this is addressed because for some, it turns them away from God because of their misunderstanding of what to pray for & how to pray to God for the answer we desire. Let’s remember that God is not the author of confusion (1 Corinthians 14 vs 33). He has guidelines that he has given us and should we stick to, so we can have the desires of our hearts.

[LINKED_TEXT: I’m working in Machine Learning. I came across a math paper suggesting a certain technique may get me better results.] [URL: https://www.dumpsinsider.com/amazon-aws-certified-developer-test-simulator] That paper contained a small error, which I corrected. Then I wrote 50 lines of code implementing the idea. The code was too slow to run, so I had to ‘vectorize’ it (write it in a form so that many operations can be done at once.) This made the code denser, but reduced it to just 12 lines. Then I tested it with my model. Results were crazy. I realized another modification was required to the original paper. It worked! I tried the new algorithm with datasets of various sizes. Finally, I compared it to the standard algorithm which everybody uses. Nope, it didn’t actually perform better. So I took all that code out. In 3 days, I wrote exactly zero lines of code. But I learned something. That paper doesn’t work, and the standard way is still the best I know of. What do we developers do all day? We think.

About 100 billion neurons make up the human brain, which can send out more electrical signals in a day than all the phones in the world put together. Mount Everest, which is the tallest mountain on Earth, is not the largest mountain in the solar system. This is the name of a volcano on Mars called Olympus Mons. It is more than 13 miles high.

That means, does the WiFi work, does the GPU work, does suspend/resume work. You may be OK if some unimportant things don’t work (fingerprint readers, for example). So, you have a lot of reading to do. Find out if anyone has published their experience with that machine. Otherwise, well, weight and specs are up to you.

The reasons for taking up gate were given in the other answers… Here I would like to write whatever that is left out…. Contents of this answer…. Subject wise analysis and type of preparation you can think ofStudy Techniques I have used during preparationRevision Techniques I have used during preparationWays to tackle Test SeriesWays to tackle previous year questionHow to incorporate standard text books during preparation Subject wise analysis and type of preparation you can think of Aptitude :- Aptitude in GATE not so difficult compared to exams like CAT and other. There will be about 10 questions of aptitude, a normal student would able to attempt around 9 questions find and might feel little hurtle to attempt one question but, with little consistent practice you would be able to attempt that one question also. What to with respective aptitude…This is not just my advise, it a common statement from all the toppers to dedicate 1hr for aptitude from day 1 of your preparation until the exam day.If you think you are great with aptitude during your last days of preparation you can think of practicing alternative days.Make sure you solve all the previous year papers. Mathematics :- I am from mechanical background so, from my perspective I can break down this subject into 2 distinct categories.Common preparation point about mathSome problems might be easy focus on the tougher ones the one which you fail. practice all the problems at least twice. If you got the answer still skeptical about the topic please go back and understand the topic.No matter how fearful about math you are math itself would constitute majority of the weightage in gate so, in no way you can ignore it must and should you should learn.If you find the model typical make sure you try to tinker the values given in the question and play around with the problem and make yourself comfortable with the problem concept. Engineering Mathematics consists of linear Algebra, Calculus and Probability statistics. These three subjects are common for many branches of engineering not just computer science so if you open previous year papers of computer science you would find around 300 to 500 problems in Linear algebra and calculus and 300 problems in probability alone so all together around 1000 problems.Learn the concept then practice previous year problems, by practicing the previous year problems for these three subjects would be enough since, for Mechanical and civil people the questions would asked in depth. Discrete Mathematics consists of Graph Theory, Set theory, Propositional Logic and CombinatoricsGraph Theory learning the concept and doing previous paper is a must, the question is asked for chromatic number of regular graph of 6 vertices (K6) you would get the answer but please don't leave the problem there, you yourself take the remaining type of graphs and adapt the question. like…..what is chromatic number of circular graph?….what is chromatic number of wheel graph?….what is chromatic number of bipartite graph?……I would like explore the question this way and take the given values to its minimum and maximum and explore and understand the concept especially for graph theory. Make sure you practice previous year question twice in graph theory.Set Theory one of the easiest subject, relation is most scoring part, don't ignore lattices dedicate special time for lattices so that if a question comes from lattices you should not miss it. Practice previous year questions twice from set theory also.Propositional Logic In no way you should miss this chapter, because no matter how tough the question is everyone who so ever is writing gate will never leave a question from this topic. In fact, this chapter don't need any lectures also. You just need lot of practice in this topic. The more you practice this topic the better you get at it. As usually practice the previous question paper twice. This particular chapter our lectures have taught us as way of solving the question by disproving the options rather than searching for the right option. This kind of approach really works.Combinatorics There is lot of scope to ask tricky questions here. The only way is to tackle the topics from this subject is to segregate them.1. De-arrangement 2.Combinations 3.Permutations 4.Combinations with repetitions5.Permutations with repetitions6.pigeon hole principle 7.functions8.many more minute topicsAs I am concerned, if I was able to segregate the problem to which topic this belong to then I would try to solve the problem with the concerned formula. Most of the time I usually get the right answer Digital Logic :- Don’t even dare to loose a mark in this subject (if the model is repeated).Counters is the most stressed topic.Remember the circuits of half adder and full adders and other important, you should be able to draw them when ever requiredPractice more than 20 problems of K mapDon’t ignore digital codes and conversions (BCD, grey..etc…)Most tricky part is 2′ complement. Computer Organization and Architecture I have no idea why all computer science people consider it as most difficult topic. For me its a fun oneRead Carl Hamcher for each topic. Line by Line and understand the way in which the author is looking at the subjectPipeline and cache is the most important chapters, I would ask you to do previous paper at least a 5 times from Pipeline and cache.When it comes to secondary memories, be sure you are using right formula and your calculations are rightInstructions and addressing modes read it as many times as possible you will get a grasp of itRemember, if a hard problem is given from this topic, its not just tough for you, its tough for AIR 1 too.. Programming in one word pointers.. pointer it is pointers… pointer… pointer… are you hearing me or not ….. pointers it is….Solve as many problems as possible from pointersThis is only subject you need to use your computer for. Don’t just solve the problem on paper. You should code the same exact thing in the computer and make sure you are getting the same output there.Would like to listen to a cheat code here, I am giving you the best cheat code for this subject, If you have good IDE for C you are most welcome to debug the code, keeping track of live variables and checking is your working on the paper matching with debugging.Recursion is place where tricky question are given, 30% of people won’t attempt it and 30% would get the answer wrong So, I think you know which part of percentage you are suppose to be …..In the final exam, I am in the 30% which you got the answer wrong, I made a mistake in indirect recursion I got AIR 7 if I would have made this question right I would have been AIR 3 … So, now you know what kind of questions are game changers….. Data Structures Practice problem a lot … from this chapter it’s not only for GATE, I would be useful for Interviews too..Stacks and queues… you need to be well versed with the code. There are many standard questions with respective stacks and queues you need have those questions on finger tips.Binary Tree…. rather than remember the formulas try to take examples and disprove the options given in the question.Make sure what is being asked is itBinary TreeSkewed Binary TreeComplete Binary TreeFull Binary TreeBinary Search TreeHeapMin HeapMax HeapAVL TreeThere is a lot of difference between all of these.. most of the time mistakes are made like, if asked binary tree in the question we would interpret as binary search tree… Be sure you are answering what is asked for…Graphs… Have a great clarity on DFS and BFS … you need to know differences,code and applications of DFS and BFS… there are hundreds of questions that can formed only with these two topics. Algorithms even though this one of the subject you need to be good at I am not well equipped with the subject So, I would only write about what I knowMake a cheat sheet of time complexitiesWhen ever you are reading about a standard algorithm… make sure you are in a position to analyse about time and space complexitiesWhen questions are given based on notations make sure you don’t miss them …. those can be the easiest questions from this topic.Dynamic programming is not just for GATE, its highly required for Interview.Minimum Cost Spanning Tree and shortest path are such topics which is appearing in every year GATE paper. Not understanding and not practicing it will be a blunder.Practice more… Corman seamed little high standard for a mechanical guy like so I followed everything from sahani. Theory of Computation Overall Idea about this subject is highly important. When a question is given in this area you should be able to distinguish boil it down to the specific sub sub topic it belongs to, either DFA or DCFL or CFL or CSL or Recursive or TM, Segregating which particular sub concept the question paper setter is trying to touch itself is a game changer.Construction of DFA is a must (this is one of the easiest topic In which I lost marks I am not proud of it).Differentiation of CFL and DCFL … have a great clarity on it.There is nothing more important that closure properties…. I will give you another cheat code here…. Instead of remembering what all closure properties hold for what all languages…. Insted remberWhat are closed for all langsWhat are not closed for all langsWhat are not closed for regularsWhat are closed for DCFLwhat are not closed for CFLwhat are not closed for RecursiveWhat are not closed for REL Undecidable read it from peter Lintz, remember standard problems of undecidablility…Have a matrix for each lang(y axis) and each problem (x-axis) and filling decidability or undecidablity in the cells.If you want to dig deeper have a fine distinction of Recursive, Semi decidable and Not REL’sFor turing machine and halting turing machine, remember all the problems … In exam under pressure you might get confused. If you have understood well enough you can solve it in the exam. Pumping lemma… people ignored it that no question is coming from topic since ten years … all of a sudden there was a question in 2019 … guess who solved the question… the ones who didn’t ignore… It hardly takes an hour to learn and practice this topic. Compiler Design :- touch this subject only after you are done with TOC or when TOC is going on….Have a clarity on various types and sub types of parsers. Initially categorize into Top down and Bottom Up parser then categorize into remaining parsers, when a question is asked you write down on scribble pad about what parser you are solving the question for.Syntax Directed Translation.. do all the previous paper question 4 times… the question paper setter really can’t confuse you here… only your computations and interpretation matters.Understand the distinction between L-attributed, S-attributed, Inherited attributes and Synthesized attributes.Don’t read the dragon book line to line… only refer it when are stuck at a particular topic. Operating System one of the toughest subjects of all time .. but with right techniques and tactics can be made into a easiest subject of all time.Read GALVIN Line to line, you are most welcome to read it twice. (only required chapters don’t read the whole book).In CPU Scheduling problems, Most of time, most of the people, make a computational mistake. Your computations are highly important in this particular subject.Short tricky and theory oriented topics like inter process communication and synchronization should never be skipped. Read and practice all the codes required. Properties like Bounded waiting, Progress and Mutual Exclusion are of deadly importance.Concurrency is a topic such that if you dedicate 5hrs to understand and practice it you will surely attempt the question and get it right if the question appears in final exam.Deadlock … just a concentrated 10hrs preparation and practice is enough 2–4 marks are in your account. It is one of the easiest topic in OS.Virtual Memory …. practice harder problem in this topic .. there had been a gradual trend of problems becoming harder and harder year by year… and there is an increasing hardness in this topic… I lost marks in this topic just because I didn’t practice harder problemsPaging… draw diagrams even if it is not required and redundant …. diagrams in paging would give a you a great clarity. Have a good distinction between all types of paging. For example, can you answer as of now difference between Segmented Paging and Paged Segmentation……? can you…?File systems and disk scheduling …. again there is no way question paper setter can trick you … only possibility of going wrong your computations. Databases.. its free given marks, if a question is asked from this subject. One of the biggest technique in this subject is (if you have a little time) solve the question by taking sample database and discarding options.ER Diagrams, don’t you dare solve the problem without putting pen on paper. Never do it with your eyes. Please do write down tables with primary keys underlined on paper then and only then you answer the question.Relational Algebra and tuple calculus…. there is a lot of scope of harder problems being asked from this topic so, practice more. One tactic is (if you are good with SQL) writing equivalent SQL query, sometimes it might work, it might not work. Take sample database and discard options. Don’t search for right answer instead, eliminate wrong options.SQL…. you should have practiced SQL before in some project or other. This is only best way to master it. If you have not done it there are tutorials on internet to practice SQL please do that. Unless you have experience writing SQL queries before , its very hard to solve the problems.Indexing…. your computations are at most importance …. models are being repeated in this topic for years….. only way you loose this question is if you don’t practice or make a computational mistake.Transactions and concurrency control…. Serilizability is the only topic you need to understand good and make sure you identifying the conflicts right. Computer Networks ….. having a little more syllabus that usual subjects… but with repeated revision you can handle this subject..Read forouzan for the topic that are there in the syllabusHave a great understanding of layers, gives you a over all idea about the subjectFlow and Error control.. practice previous problems and make sure you make no mistake in computation. Have in mind what exactly being asked in the questionRouting… if you spend 3hrs on this topic you can sure shot attempt this questionThere are only five application layer protocols given in the syllabus it might take only 2hrs to read about each one of themIf the question paper setter want to ask a logical and computation intensive question from this subject only area he could touch cryptography. There are only a handful of cryptographic algorithms to be learnt and it hardly takes 3hrs to learn and practice each one of them.Learn front and back of TCP, UDP and difference between them.Finally Most important, Most Expected Untapped Area Questions to be asked on toipcs are WIFI and IPV6. These topics have been included in the syllabus 3–4 years back but not a single question is posed on them so, you can expect question from these topics. I have only commented on most important thing with respective every subject, it is to be noted that every topic in the GATE syllabus is important and every topic in GATE syllabus is worthy of question being asked from. I have given you main points but, no topic to be ignored. Study Techniques I have used during preparation Most of my study techniques won’t be any different from any topper but still I would like to list out for your reference Pomodaro is how I used to count study hours daily. A detail explanation is given in my talk about pomodaro and if you google about this study technique you would get a lot of information about this technique written by scholars. I have used a app called Flat Tomato [LINKED_TEXT: ‎Flat Tomato (Time Management)] [URL: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flat-tomato-time-management/id719462746].Everyday post class I would revise what ever taught in the class and I used to redo whatever problems taught in the class.Never skipped a class. Due to dengue fever I had to skip 1 week classes then after in order to recover those classes I have to go to management take a letter and attend those classes in some other batch.Used to write notes in the class. These coaching lectures notes are complied and easier version of Standard Textbook. The soft copies of these notes are available online.Wrote short notes to all the subjects. Instead of making short notes smaller version of normal notes, I tried my level best to make my short notes contain a list of my mistakes.Solved Previous Paper twice, but I would advise you solve it thrice.Practice ACE Academy material, The material is good but there are lot of typos in it , It’s not only case of ACE Academy, Everyone’s material in the market have lot’s and lot’s of mistakes ). Anyway, its up to you to solve the material, there is nothing you would lose by solving the coaching material.Test Series ……… one and only way to evaluate yourself. Believe me, there is no other way.There are many more study techniques I have given in my talk including techniques like pomodaro, it comes around 17:41. I have given a link to my talk at the end of answer. If you want to know a little more about my study techniques I have written in another answer also I have written the way to use the study resources………[LINKED_TEXT: Phani Madhusudhan Thontepu's answer to What was your GATE (CSE) preparation story?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/What-was-your-GATE-CSE-preparation-story/answer/Phani-Madhusudhan-Thontepu?ch=10&share=13ae2926&srid=npmQz] Revision Techniques I have used during preparation.. My Vajrayudham (greatest weapon) was spaced repetition. See, there is no need for this particular techniques to help you in your preparation. I am saying it helped me I might or might not help you. Spaced repetition was only for revision, remembering and retaining purpose, I have done it in two phases. To describe……Learning Spaced repetitionThis used to go with classesEvery day what ever taught, came back home and read those what ever taughtWhatever problems taught in class, I used to do it back on the same day in the evening.Then yesterday topic revision.Then one week back revision.Then one month back revision if necessary (usually I sometimes skipped it because I didn't have time) Revision 1 Time Spaced Repetition (What you actually see in the photos I have attached)Noted down late date on which topic is completed.Form last date, 1 week after I wrote date then, I used to study whole subjectForm last date, 15 days after I wrote date then, again I used to study whole subject.From last date, 1 month after I wrote date then, again I used to revise whole subjectFrom last date, 2 months after I wrote date then, again I used to revise whole subject (this only I used to do for hard subjects, you can find the date in compiler design and computer networks) See techniques are to bound to you, you are not bound to techniques, please mould them as per your requirement. The ultimate objective is to learn subject and attain marks. Every time I take a test, If some question has gone wrong, I used to take a look at that topic from short notes this used to be a kind of mini revisionTest are a kind of revision .. during taking of a test.. your mind would be concentrated on retrieving a topic .. this would stress you brain and neurons patterns which have learnt the topic would be reinforced which helps the subject to be retained betterI have given a clear explanation of my revision strategy “Forgetting curve and Spaced Repetition”. In my talk, It comes around 8:32. I have given a link to my talk at the end of answer. Ways to Tackle Test Series doesn’t matter how good you are, You need to take test series. The one and only way of evaluating yourself is through test series. please do enroll in at least 2 and at most 3 test series. Don't over whelm yourself in enrolling in more than three test series. Make a schedule on how to attempt the test from test series and follow schedule carefully. Don't get demotivated when you secure a very low score in test series and overconfident if you score well. This is the one and only way to evaluate yourself. My testing schedule was different, Instead of telling you what I did for testing I will tell you what I think is best for taking test. I would ask you to take a look at test series, you would find 25m test (30 min), 50m test (1.5hrs) and full length test. Don’t delay giving tests, thinking that after I have completed all my studies I would be giving tests.I would advise anyone to take 25m test as soon as they are done with studying the topic (Let it what ever month it is), as soon as you think you are done with the topic please try to attempt 25M test that would given you an idea about how far you have learnt the topic, you can also analyse how good you have learnt the topic with respective to GATE.I would advise anyone to take 1.5hrs tests during their revision times in the month of October and November. This will give you an idea of what your weak topic and what your strong topic as are, you would encounter models now repeatedly, this would tell you what all models you need to be thorough with.I would advise anyone to take 3hrs tests during the last few months before test, namely December,January and Feb. This would tell you where you are lying and what all you need to improve at and how to tackle the actual exam.See, the 3hrs test thing, various toppers have various perspective on it, some say you need to give full length test every week from the starting of preparation and there are many more views on full length test, I gave you mine. Ways to tackle previous year questions at least 3 times every single question There was a time when solving previous GATE questions was enough to get a reasonably good rank but, times have changed. If you actually see through the past 5 years question papers, I think you will find new questions appearing every year and question being asked from untapped areas. So, there is huge possibility that you might miss these questions if you are only solving PYQ’s. While solving previous year gate questions, please keep these in mind…. If a model is appearing more than once, this is only indication that its a important model. By tinkering the values given in the question make sure that you know this model front and back.There is no certain year from which you need to practice the questions from why would I say this because there has be n number of instances where a model resurfaced after many years. Examples…In Theory of Computation, There was a question on pumping lemma in 1990's then after there was never a question on that topic, again one question appeared in 2019 paper.In computer Organization, There was question about gates to register function while execution of instruction, I still remember that topic in coaching classes was taught but not with much emphasis (because questions stopped coming from that topic since last ten years) but, when I was solving PYQ's I came across this model and even though it was a model of 1989's I still spent an hour reading that topic from carl Hamacher (it was not in detail in the notes). My luck had its way, a question from exactly that topic appeared in GATE 2020. If you have committed mistake while working out a PYQ, make sure you mark it and solve it later point of time, by later point of time I don’t mean in the evening or 2 hrs later, because you will remember the mistake, solve it after a week then if you didn’t get the mistake again you got the concept right, if you committed the same mistake again then you are fooling yourself saying that you understood the topic.If you repeatedly making mistakes in a particular question, take the reference book read that topic and learn the topic again from the scratch. You should have a mistake tolerance for PYQ’s (no of times you can acceptably get wrong answer to a question). How to incorporate standard text books during preparation do not ignore standard textbooks. The list of standard text books are going to be same there are not going to differ from topper to topper. I would like to list of my standard textbook list for only those subject which I read….Computer Organization - Carl Hamacher (only difficult topic)Operating Systems - Galvin (read line to line)Computer Networks - ForouzanAlgorithms - Sahani (only required Algo’s)Theory of computation - Peter Linz (if and only if I didn’t understand the topic)Databases - Korth (only for certain chapters)Compiler Design - Ullman (only for a couple of parsers)See there are lot more standard textbooks in the market if its recommended by a professor they are goodThe way you need to read a standard textbook is different, you can’t just read it like a newspaper, In other answer, I have explained in detail about the way to read a standard Text book [LINKED_TEXT: Phani Madhusudhan Thontepu's answer to How do I read a standard textbook effectively?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-read-a-standard-textbook-effectively/answer/Phani-Madhusudhan-Thontepu?ch=10&share=f308fd53&srid=npmQz] Most of the techniques during preparation which are to be stressed a lot are given in my talk … Finally, what ever I wrote above are my personal opinion and my advises, it up to you to follow these or there is no necessity that these will be true for your case too. A little boasting of my preparationThe pens I have kept track of from day 1 to final exam day, My study rack, consisting of Standard text books, notes, Rough notes and other books I read for fun….

There are advantages and disadvantages of using them. For example thorium can't be used in existing reactors, which means we can't simply switch from uranium to thorium without massive investment into refitting existing power plants. On the other hand, thorium can't be used to make weapons grade nuclear material, so would prevent or at least reduce the risk of nuclear proliferation. I think we'll eventually build commercial thorium reactors, but for the moment there's little economic value in doing so.

Composition: Granite is an igneous rock formed from the slow crystallization of molten magma deep within the Earth's crust. It primarily consists of quartz, feldspar, and mica, with other minerals present in smaller amounts. Marble, on the other hand, is a metamorphic rock formed from the recrystallization of limestone or dolomite minerals under intense heat and pressure. It is predominantly composed of calcite or dolomite minerals. Appearance: Granite typically has a granular and speckled appearance due to the interlocking crystals of different minerals. It comes in a wide range of colors, including various shades of gray, white, pink, black, and even blues and greens. Marble often exhibits a smooth and veined appearance, with distinctive patterns and swirls caused by impurities and mineral deposits. It comes in various colors, such as white, beige, gray, green, and black. Properties: Granite is known for its durability and hardness, making it highly resistant to scratches, heat, and chemical damage. It is commonly used for kitchen countertops, flooring, and outdoor applications. Marble is softer compared to granite, making it more susceptible to scratches, etching from acidic substances, and heat damage. It is commonly used for interior surfaces, such as countertops, flooring, and decorative accents. \\"JK Stone\\" is mentioned in your question as a [LINKED_TEXT: natural stone manufacturer in Bhopal, India.] [URL: https://jkstones.in/natural-stone-manufacturer-in-bhopal/] As a manufacturer, they likely specialize in sourcing, processing, and supplying various types of natural stones, including granite and marble, for construction and decorative purposes.

This unique quality of honey is attributed to its chemical composition and the conditions in which it is stored. Honey has a relatively low water content, typically ranging from 14% to 18%. Bacteria and other microorganisms require a higher water content to grow and multiply, making the low moisture level in honey unfavorable for their survival. When microorganisms are exposed to honey, the water present in their cells is drawn out through osmosis, effectively dehydrating and killing them. In addition to its low water content, honey has a relatively high sugar content, primarily consisting of fructose and glucose. Sugars act as natural preservatives by reducing the availability of water for microbial growth through a process called \\"osmotic pressure.\\" The concentrated sugar solution in honey creates an environment where microorganisms are less likely to thrive. Furthermore, honey has an acidic pH level, typically ranging from 3.2 to 4.5. The acidic nature of honey further inhibits the growth of bacteria and other spoilage-causing organisms. This pH range is not conducive to the survival and reproduction of most microorganisms. To preserve honey's longevity, it is crucial to store it in a sealed container in a cool, dry place. Exposure to heat, moisture, and air can degrade its quality and potentially allow for microbial contamination. When stored properly, honey can remain edible and retain its flavor and nutritional properties for an indefinite period. The discovery of jars of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs, still in an edible state after thousands of years, is a testament to honey's remarkable preservation qualities. It serves as a fascinating example of the natural resilience of certain substances and their ability to resist spoilage over extended periods of time."},{"prompt":"Which angel is more popular, the Angel Michael, or the Angel Gabriel?","completion":"Chriss Angel?

We’ll include some of those on the list, but we’ll start with other “investments” that are also important for your long-term wealth. Top Off Your Emergency Fund Risk level: Low If you don’t have a fully-funded emergency fund), this should be your top investment priority. According to a well-publicized 2018 survey from the Federal Reserve, four out of 10 people wouldn’t be able to cover even a small 400 emergency in cash — and that was well before the pandemic even started. If 2020 has taught us anything, it’s that your entire financial life can be upended overnight. When that happens, your emergency fund is literally your financial lifeline. A good place to keep your emergency fund is in a high-yield savings account. A savings deposit account lets you easily access that cash. It’s also recommended to keep some of it in cold, hard cash — say, 500 or 1,000 — in case of an emergency that shuts down the electrical grid (and ATMs with it). The only downside to this approach is that right now savings accounts aren’t paying a lot of interest. On the flip side if you keep some of your emergency fund in cash at home, it won’t pay any interest at all and you run the risk of losing it or having it stolen. Nevertheless, having an emergency fund in some form or other is a non-negotiable for financial stability. We recommend you check out CIT for your online savings needs. Hire a Financial Advisor Financial advisors can perform many different roles in your financial life. If you really couldn’t care less about how your investments are managed, hiring a financial advisor might be your best choice. They are available to manage your investments and answer your questions throughout the entire process — of course, this is usually the highest-cost option.

Conclusion If you’re in the enviable position of having to figure out what to do with 20,000, you have a few options. The truth is that it doesn’t need to be so black-and-white. You don’t need to choose one option at the expense of all of the others. You can choose bits and pieces from this list: use a bit to top off your emergency fund here, buy some index funds within your IRA there, and so on. Ultimately, you’ll need to decide which of these choices is the best use of your extra cash, based on your short- and long-term goals, But to avoid much loss in the market, you need to have a professional analyst like Victoria Grace Lindsay managing your portfolio.

If you are struggling with the same issues, here are few helpful reminders: 1. Their opinions are not paying your bills. - The biggest realization you can have is that your family is depending on you to make your business/career/life successful. You have bills to pay and mouths to feed. There is no shame in paying your bills through a legitimate, legal business or Job! 2. Is this EVEN true? Ask yourself this daily. - Did someone actually say this or are you making it up in your head? 3. If they don’t support you, they’re not a true friend. - A confident, happy person will be cheering you on. If they’re not, don’t waste your energy worrying about it. 4. They’re not ready yet. - Very rarely does someone become successful overnight. Gary Vaynerchuk and Ankur Warikoo put out content for so many years before they became well known. Some may not understand the benefit of your product/service quite yet. Keep marketing and growing your business and serving your audience because they will get it eventually and may come back. 5. YOU have to live with your decisions, not them. - As Rachel Hollis says, “Don’t let someone in the cheap seats have an expensive opinion on your life.” As you know, 90% of start-ups fail within 5 years.

The small ones are 2–3 bottles worth, and break down into nothing. You can chop them with scissors and take those out with the bag in your pocket and cardboard box taped around your body, under a shirt. Plus, boxwine is what someone would get for a party, or strategic alcoholism; getting a 5-day jug, every day from different stores. That doesn’t solve the problem of the bottles you already do have, of it you just love your one brand. Level 1; Juvie style. If the person you need to get past is in a back room, drop the bottles out a window, and pick them up to put in the next bin, or throw in the ditch if you must. You can also start drinking a lot of soda, so the wine bottles just happen to get thrown away, still in the big garbage bag. Just trying to save face, this works well enough. Pro-level is replacing beer cans in the soda case. Level 2; Spouse’s side-eye. You can find a way to wrap it in laundry, a toolbox, gym bag and get it from the attic hiding spot to the car. Build a pile behind the shed that gets too big to move. An advanced delinquent skill is holding things against one’s chest in a coat, through the coat pockets. Don’t take Ritter’s lesson this time and do allow some leeway because hiding your front at all costs is a dead giveaway. Level 3; Failing rehab. You go back to jail if they bust you in the halfway house. That’s when you make a sacrifice. Those bottles are going in someone’s shoes or hanging clothes’ pockets. They’re getting chucked in the crawlspace, inside the recliner. Will you get caught?

Yes, you have the option to Doubt something, but it’s not a Smart Move when someone is offering your the same item for 40–50% Discount from the normal Rate but still you are not grabbing it because you think there are some Tricks Flipkart or Amazon is doing with you. Below I’ll share few Screenshots of this Year’s Best Deals that comes in Flipkart and Amazon Sales. But before that I’ll surely clear this Simple doubt of people that Whether Flipkart or Amazon Fooling People using this Big Billion Days Sale? Well, the Answer is a BIG NOOO. Why? Because being an Affiliate Marketer, I always follow Amazon & Flipkart both Sites. I’m doing this for last few years. So it’s obvious that I know almost all kind of normal Rates of any Product being sold on Flipkart and Amazon. So when a Sale Day Comes, I can Differentiate Product that are Listed with the HUGE Margin of Discount. Just like a Bean Bag. Why I’m especially mentioning about Bean Bag? Because the Courier Guy just Delivered me a Bean Bag now. So let’s take the Example of that Bean Bag only. Normally a Bean Bag is sold at a Price of Around Rs. 500–800/- Here you can see the Screenshot. And the Bean Bag that I have bought is now Out of Stock with a Price of Rs. 854/- Here you can see it. And this same Bean Bag, I’ve bought for Rs. 99/- and today I’ve got the delivery also. Now do you think Flipkart fooled me by selling me the same Bean bag at Rs. 99/- when they are selling it for Rs. 854/- in normal days? Here is the SS that I’ve bought it for Rs. 99/- This is just an Example. There are so many items that are came into an Insane Price this year. Like almost all the Premium and Exclusive Mobile Phones were selling with 2000–5000 Extra Discount which is totally Unexpected. Because even you know the fact that there no Discount allowed on Exclusive Mobile Phones. Even these Mobile Brands are not allowing Affiliate Marketers with a Commission if they sell their Mobile Phones. But still then, they are giving 2000–5000 Discount on their Exclusive Mobile Phones. You will not see this all the time. I really feel sad for them who missed this years Sale. But it’s never too late. I am expected another Sale before Diwali or New Year.

If you want to know which people are closest to Early Medieval Turks both culturally and genealogical, than it are Kazakhs (and Kyrgyz), partially also Bashkirs, Karakalpaks, or Yakuts. As a whole, Kazakhs were those people who lived the nomadic life in the territory of Kazakhstan. Kazakhs were those people who always remained “true to the heritage of their ancestors” and did not revert to a settled form of life. Of course, the Uzbeks, Turkmens, Tatars, Uyghurs, etc. are also Turkic peoples. But in terms of continuation of our ancient culture, we Kazakhs are far closer. Tuvans can be regarded as Turkic source population, representing the earliest stage of Turkic nomadic peoples. Finally, an extensive study of the genetic legacy of the Turkic nomads across Eurasia based on autosomal dna analysis reveals that the source populations for the Turkic nomads who spread 'Asian genes' to non-Turkic peoples were (the ancestors of modern-day) Tuvinians, Mongols and Buryats, despite the fact that the latter two are Mongolic (Yunusbayev et al. 2015).81 In sum, one should note that the early eastern Turkic peoples were in all likelihood genetically closer to their neighbouring Mongolic peoples than to various later Turkic peoles of central and western Eurasia. Tuvans:"},{"prompt":"What is the difference between granite and marble?","completion":"Granite and Marble are two distinct types of natural stone commonly used in construction and interior design. While they share some similarities, there are several key differences between them. Composition: Granite is an igneous rock primarily composed of minerals such as quartz, feldspar, and mica. It forms from the cooling and solidification of molten magma deep within the Earth's crust. Marble, on the other hand, is a metamorphic rock that originates from limestone. Through intense heat and pressure, the minerals in limestone recrystallize, resulting in the formation of Marble. Appearance: Granite and Marble have different appearances due to their distinct mineral compositions. Granite often features a speckled or mottled appearance with a variety of colors, including shades of gray, black, white, pink, and green. The individual mineral crystals in Granite contribute to its unique and textured look. Marble, on the other hand, typically exhibits a smoother and more uniform appearance. It is renowned for its veined patterns, which can range from subtle to bold. Marble is available in various colors, including white, gray, beige, and even vibrant hues like green and red. Durability: Granite is known for its exceptional durability, making it highly resistant to scratches, heat, and stains. It is a popular choice for kitchen countertops and high-traffic areas. Marble, although beautiful and elegant, is softer and more porous than Granite. It is susceptible to scratches and can be damaged by acids, including those found in many household cleaning products. Consequently, Marble is often used in areas with less wear and tear, such as bathrooms, fireplace surrounds, and decorative elements. Maintenance: Granite requires minimal maintenance and is relatively easy to clean. Regular sealing can help enhance its stain resistance. Marble, being more porous, requires more maintenance. It is essential to seal Marble surfaces regularly to protect against staining and etching. Additionally, Marble surfaces should be cleaned with gentle, pH-neutral cleaners to prevent damage. Application: Both Granite and Marble have a wide range of applications in construction and design. Granite is commonly used for kitchen countertops, bathroom vanities, flooring, and outdoor paving. Its durability and resistance to heat make it suitable for kitchen environments. Marble, with its elegant and luxurious appearance, is often used for bathroom countertops, wall cladding, flooring, and decorative features like statues and columns. It adds a touch of sophistication to any space. Cost: In general, Granite is more affordable than Marble. The price of both stones can vary depending on factors such as color, quality, and availability. However, Granite tends to be more cost-effective due to its widespread availability and durability. Marble, being a more luxurious material, is often more expensive. In summary, Granite and Marble differ in terms of their composition, appearance, durability, maintenance requirements, applications, and cost. Understanding these differences can help you make an informed decision when choosing between the two for your specific project or design needs."},{"prompt":"What are some effective software tools that an inside sales team can use to boost productivity?","completion":"How about boosting your productivity with the most used tools?

I remember the first boat show I went to there was a really nice sailboat there for 5 million. IIRC it was around 70 - 80 feet long. It had a Jacuzzi on deck in front of the mast, a double curved stairway to the main salon, a crystal chandelier and all sorts of other niceties. To me that seemed like a super yacht. A few years later I went to a boat show where there was a big power boat. It had twin diesels and a separate cabin for the captain. Oh yeah, it also had a dance floor, a bar, perhaps 6 or 8 staterooms, a helipad, davits for a 30 foot motor launch and quarters for the 10 crew and other officers. The twin diesels were each 12 cylinders (or maybe 16?) and were each almost 10 feet high. The ‘yacht’ was over 200 feet long and had 3 covered decks not including the open decks on top. So which was the super yacht? The 5 million sailboat or the unknown-priced power boat? Without a definition of ‘super yacht’ there are so many variables that it’s really impossible to answer. Power boats (big or small) use a lot more fuel than sailboat which by definition don’t use much fuel because they’re sailing. I haven’t spent more than about 10 in fuel in a year for my sailboat while I know people with powerboats 2/3 the size who burn over 200 of fuel per weekend. Of course my boat engine is diesel which is a lot more efficient than a gas engine but as a sailboat I only use the engine coming in and out of the dock on almost every trip. So is your super yacht a power boat or a sailboat? And is it gas (petrol) or diesel? It makes a huge difference. Do you need a crew or can you handle the boat yourself? Obviously if you need a paid crew you have to add a reasonable salary per person. Are they live-aboard or is it just a day job? Is your super yacht 70 feet long or 210 feet long? Most marinas and yacht clubs charge by the foot so 210 foot long boat will nominally cost 3 times as much to dock as a 70 foot boat - except that not every harbor can handle 210 foot boats so there might be a premium for docking spaces that long. What that means is that instead of paying say 2 per foot per night for a 70 foot boat you might pay perhaps 5 per foot per night for a 210 foot boat - much more than 3 times. But where is that dock? Costs for a luxury location like perhaps Marseilles, France will likely cost more per foot than a not-so-luxurious spot like perhaps Anchorage, Alaska. Is the boat in salt water or in fresh water? Salt water corrodes the metal parts on a boat a lot faster than fresh water, the topsides as well as under water. Are you in tropical waters with intense sunlight beating down on the woodwork or a temperate climate where it’s not nearly as harsh? But then in tropical areas the boat can stay in the water all year round whereas in northern climates the boat may have to be hauled for the winter. There’s lots of other variables as well. Is the boat fiberglass, wood, steel, aluminum, ferro-cement? How much woodwork is there? I could keep naming them off but the main point is that the question is too vague to answer."},{"prompt":"What is the most shocking substitution in a football match?","completion":"05/07/2014, Netherlands v Costa Rica, Due to 0–0 scoreline in the full time, the game headed towards the extra time. The pressure was upon both teams, A WORLD CUP QUARTERFINALS, the underdogs, Costa Rica, against all odds had held their nerves till the 90 min and then the extra time came. They displayed a good game of football and it was sure that the game was heading towards penalties. Louis van Gaal decided to make his final change of the game, changing his keeper in the 121st minute of the game. Tim Krul was brought on for Cillessen, miraculously Krul saved 2 penalties and Holland went through.

DON’T DO IT…….UNLESS you like hefty repair bills that FAR EXCEED the pittance you’re going to save by running inferior octane gasoline!!!! High octane fuel is rated higher by the fuel’s ability to resist detonating. in other words, 93 octane fuel is less apt to pre-ignite than than 87 octane…..The fuel’s ability to resist igniting prematurely is HUGE! In a high compression engine, low octane fuel ignites BEFORE the spark plug fires simply due to the higher pressures/temperatures created by a high compression of forced induction (supercharge or turbocharger) which creates WICKEDLY increased cylinder temperatures and pressures….ESPECIALLY if detonation occurs!!! The reason you’re engine has a high octane requirement is due to the compression ratio, induction method etc. The engineers who developed this engine KNOW what they’re talking about! When you run a lower than recommended octane, you’re almost certainly creating detonation (look it up) which essentially means the air/fuel mixture is igniting, due to heat from high compression/forced induction, which creates a separate “flame” and the two “flames” collide with each other. In other terms, you’re creating excessive pressure and heat which not only causes “pinging”, it very well can and will cause burned valves, burned pistons (I can’t tell you how many times I tore an engine down to see holes melted in the top of the piston(s)….. On modern, computer controlled engines, your ECM (computer) is going to detect the “knock” created by “pinging”. this immediately results in retarded ignition timing, which this alone will dramatically reduce the power output of the engine, causing you to depress the gas pedal even harder, compounding the situation because the detonation will worsen according to engine load/RPM , forcing you to go harder on the gas which is going to wipe out any savings at the pump b y dramatically reducing your fuel mileage. I can go into the engineering behind this, but all but the most educated people aren’t going to understand what I’m saying anyway…so i am not going to waste my time to type it out. I tell my customers BEFORE THEY BUY A VEHICLE to RESEARCH items such as “vehicle requires PREMIUM fuel”, minimum 91–93 octane as this is not put on the vehicle for anyone’s health, other than the person buying the car. IF YOU CAN’T AFFORD TO RUN THE PROPER FUEL, YOU CAN’T AFFORD TO OWN THE VEHICLE!!!!! I CAN’T EXPLAIN THIS ANY BETTER…and I don’t say this to be “mean”. I’ve been a MASTER tech for over 30 years now….and trust me, the old adage “You can pay me now or pay me later”….either way matters not to me. I make a hell of a lot more doing heavy engine repair than i ever will maintaining your vehicle.

Paganism is an umbrella-term. Another fine colonial-era invention. It used to mean Europeans that practiced folk religion, then they started tossing all polytheistic worldviews into the bag. If you want accuracy, you’re going to have to compare Christianity to each worldview called ‘pagan’. I believe Buddhism is ethically superior to Christianity. I believe one wouldn’t have to look very close or far to make that deduction. I acknowledge though that not all polytheistic religions and philosophies seem ethically superior to Christianity. I don’t think it’s ethical or conducive to the end of suffering to have blood games and human sacrifices like the Meso-Americans did> just for example. Christians like to accuse ‘pagans’ of things they made up themselves sometimes. Like saying ‘pagans’ go to Friday Sabbats to sacrifice babies and children to the horned-god. The fact of the matter is, most polytheistic societies were strongly family-oriented, and those kinds of accusations are propaganda bunk. Many of the notions we today value concerning humanism and virtue came from the Greek philosophers.

Top 10 Importances OF On-Page SEO in Digital Marketing: 1. Keyword Research: * The act of finding the precise words and phrases that people use while looking for information, goods, or services on search engines is known as keyword research. It is an important aspect of search engine optimization (SEO) and helps website owners and marketers understand the language and topics their target audience uses. * Identify relevant words and phrases that people will probably type into a search engine when seeking information about your website. To locate high-volume, low-competition keywords, use keyword research tools. Here are some steps involved in keyword research: * Define your goals: Determine the purpose of your keyword research. Clarifying your goals will help you focus on relevant keywords. Brainstorm topics: Start by brainstorming broad topics related to your business, industry, or niche. Think about what your target audience might search for when looking for information related to your offerings. * Use keyword research tools: Use tools like Google Keyword Planner, SEMrush, Ahrefs, or Moz's Keyword Explorer for keyword research. These tools provide data on search volume, competition, and related keywords. Enter your brainstormed topics or seed keywords into these tools to generate a list of potential keywords. * Analyze keyword metrics: Review the data provided by the keyword research tools to evaluate the potential of each keyword. Look for keywords with a high search volume, low competition, and relevance to your business. Consider long-tail keywords (phrases containing multiple words), as they tend to be more specific and have a higher chance of conversion. 2. Title Tags: Each page should have a unique and descriptive title tag that includes the primary keyword. Keep it within 60 characters to ensure it displays properly in search engine results. An HTML element called the title tag is used to specify a webpage's title. It is displayed on the browser's title bar or tab, and it also appears as the clickable headline in search engine results pages (SERPs). In addition to its SEO value, the title tag also serves as a crucial element for the user experience. It helps users quickly identify the content they're looking for when browsing multiple tabs or bookmarking pages. 3. Meta Description: Write compelling meta descriptions that summarize the content of each page. Although meta descriptions don't directly impact rankings, they can influence click-through rates from search engine results pages (SERPs). A meta description refers to a short HTML attribute that provides a concise summary or preview of the content of a web page. It is typically displayed in search engine results pages (SERPs) as a snippet below the page title and URL. 4. Heading Tags: Properly structure your content using heading tags (H1, H2, H3, etc.) to indicate the hierarchy and importance of different sections. Use relevant keywords in your headings to signal the topic of the content. Heading tags are HTML elements used to define the headings or titles of sections within a web page. They provide structure and hierarchy to the content, allowing both users and search engines to understand the organization and importance of different sections. * In HTML, there are six levels of heading tags, from <h1> to <h6>, with <h1> being the highest level and <h6> the lowest. 5. URL Structure: Create clean and descriptive URLs that include relevant keywords. A well-structured URL makes a website more accessible to users and aids search engines in comprehending the page's context. * The term \\"URL structure\\" describes how a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), the address used to find information on the internet, is organized and formatted. The URL structure is composed of various components that help identify the specific webpage or resource and its location within a website. Both consumers and search engines should be able to easily read and comprehend a well-structured URL. It should ideally include relevant keywords, reflect the website's hierarchy, and be human-readable. A clear URL structure can improve the overall user experience, help search engines index and rank the website's pages more effectively, and make it easier to share and link to specific resources. 6. Content Optimization: * Produce original, valuable material that is of the highest caliber and relevance to your audience. Incorporate target keywords naturally into the content, headings, and meta tags. Several techniques can be employed for image optimization, including: * Compression: By eliminating extra data and compressing the image data, one can shrink the file size of an image. There are lossless and lossy compression methods, with lossy compression providing higher levels of compression but potentially sacrificing some image quality. * Resizing: Scaling down the dimensions of an image to match the required display size can significantly reduce its file size. This is particularly important when displaying images on smaller screens or mobile devices. Format selection: Choosing the right image format can contribute to optimization. JPEG, PNG, and GIF are popular formats that each have their own advantages and ideal applications. For example, JPEG is suitable for photographs, while PNG is ideal for images with transparency. 7. Image Optimization: Optimize images by reducing file size, using descriptive file names, and adding alt tags. Alt tags provide text descriptions that help search engines understand the content of the image. * The technique of lowering the file size and enhancing the quality of photos on websites or other digital platforms is known as image optimization. It involves various techniques and strategies aimed at reducing the file size of an image without significantly compromising its visual quality. 8. Internal Linking: Internal linking helps search engines discover and navigate your site, improving the overall crawlability and indexing of your pages. * Internal linking refers to the practice of linking web pages or content within the same website. It involves creating hyperlinks that connect one page to another page on the same domain. 9. User Experience (UX): Internal linking refers to the practice of linking web pages or content within the same website. It involves creating hyperlinks that connect one page to another page on the same domain. These links, which can be text- or image-based, are frequently included in the body of web pages. * Ensure that the website is user-friendly, simple to use, and loads rapidly. A positive user experience can indirectly impact search engine rankings, as search engines prioritize sites that provide a good user experience. 10. Mobile optimization: Mobile optimization typically involves various techniques and practices, including: Responsive design: Creating a flexible and adaptable design that adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes and orientations This ensures that content remains readable and accessible across a range of mobile devices. * Fast loading times: enhancing the website's or app's functionality to load more rapidly on mobile devices, as these consumers frequently have poorer internet connections than desktop ones. This involves minimizing file sizes, optimizing code, and leveraging caching techniques. * Touch-friendly interfaces: designing user interfaces that work well with touch inputs like pinching, swiping, and touching Elements like buttons, menus, and forms should be appropriately sized and spaced for comfortable interaction on touchscreens. Simplified navigation: Streamlining the navigation structure and menus to accommodate smaller screens and limited space Mobile-optimized websites often use collapsible menus, hamburger icons, or prioritized content to improve usability.

This will go down in history as one the major errors in the scientific community and to avoid this coming to light the basic thermodynamics of water is AVOIDED as being inconvenient and thus placed in the position of being merely a feedback influence in deference to the CO2 hypothesis.

I love some of the answers here and Jim White hit the nail on the head! There is evidence of life after death, or an afterlife…plenty of it. The problem seems to be that no one does any research on it. They just repeat what others have said, which is “There is no such thing”, yet they have zero experience to base that on. I’m not going to talk about a religious afterlife. To me, that’s a bunch of hooey, made up to make people feel better and act accordingly. First, it is not a proven fact that our consciousness resides strictly in the brain, contrary to what someone else here wrote. We don’t completely understand consciousness and there are several theories regarding consciousness not being entirely a brain function. So, that excuse is out. Regarding paranormal events (like ghosts, etc) there actually is a lot of evidence that “something” *is going on with unseen and/or seen apparitions. The problem with this evidence is that it’s easy to dismiss and can’t be repeated in any sort of scientific manner, although people are trying and making some headway. Photos, videos and evps can all be faked, so skeptics would rather just throw the baby out with the bathwater. It’s unfortunate there are people who think it’s funny to fake these things, b/c it just muddies the waters for serious researchers and of course, ruins any chance of being taken seriously. I’m sure there are a lot of people rolling their eyes by now. To that, there’s nothing I can say to change their minds. Just because they haven’t experienced something doesn’t mean it’s not real. The one thing that keeps me going, of my research, is an EVP that a friend and I got one night. We were all alone in the country at an old church at night. I had the tape recorder going and said something to the effect of “If anyone is here, please say something”. We got an immediate response of a man’s voice. He sounded like he was in an echo-y area, sounding differently than my voice on tape. He said “Are you listening?” The word “listening” went up in tone as if for emphasis. And the fact was, we weren’t listening or paying attention. We just figured nothing would happen, so we didn’t even check the tape until weeks later. There is no mistaking the man’s voice, there is no mistaking he replied directly and in context to the question, there is no mistaking the fact that no man was present or anywhere within miles of us. At this particular church we had a lot of inexplicable incidents that I haven’t written about yet, but this one is a solid example of a disembodied voice responding to me. Of course, no one else will take this as evidence b/c they weren’t there, etc, but I know it happened. I’m not a gullible person and I have done a lot of research in this subject. There is a lot of misinformation out there by supposedly legit ghost hunting shows that also works against any serious research, but that’s life."},{"prompt":"What is the difference between perfume, eau de toilette and cologne?","completion":"what is the difference between perfume and cologne Perfume Perfume, also known as Eau de Parfum, is the most potent oil concentration. Typically, a bottle of perfume has an oil concentration of 20%. Any perfume user will find that the fragrance they choose will last from morning to evening. But as the days go by, the smell fades. Fragrance should be present at full strength for 6-8 hours. This is the longest lasting of all types of perfume. Due to the high concentration of oil, perfume is usually the most expensive option. Also, people with sensitive skin often choose perfumes because they are lower in alcohol and therefore better for the skin. The low alcohol content does not dry out the skin as much and causes much less irritation for people with sensitive skin. In most cases, perfumes are aimed at women. cologne Cologne, also known as Eau de Cologne, is a type of fragrance with a much lower concentration of fragrance than perfume. A bottle of perfume can contain 2-4% concentration of fragrance. This is why it is much cheaper than perfume and lasts about 2 hours. The defining feature of Cologne is its frequent use of traditional recipes or ingredients, such as herbs and citrus notes, and little attachment to base notes. Also, these types of perfumes are often reused throughout the day. Common perfumes used today include citrus, sea, wood, and leather. In most cases, colognes are marketed to men. difference between perfume and cologne Perfumes have a stronger scent than cologne, due to their higher concentration of essential oils and are generally less expensive. Cologne on the other hand is mostly marketed towards men, however they are unisex, and a lot of women enjoy using cologne rather than perfume. What are the pros and cons of perfumes and colognes? Each type of smell has its pros and cons. Here are the pros and cons of perfumes and colognes. Perfume Benefits - Perfumes have a stronger smell than colognes because of the high concentration of essential oils.- It doesn't take a lot of nostalgia to make a big statement.- The fragrance is versatile and can be added to the bath, hair or skin depending on your intentions.- Some perfume bottles are very portable.- For users with sensitive skin, the lower the alcohol content, the better.Conss of Perfume- Perfume can be quite expensive, which sometimes puts the average user off.- Those with a sensitive nose can feel the overwhelming scent with an extremely pungent scent.Cologne Benefits. Cologne is for men but unisex and many women prefer cologne instead of perfume.- Premium colognes use premium ingredients that provide a much longer-lasting fragrance.- For convenience, the fragrance is available in spray or spray form.- Cologne is often more reasonably priced than perfumes with high concentrations of essential oils.- Colognes has a subtle scent that won't overwhelm or attract unwanted attention.Cons ofCologne- Cologne bottles often have odd or bulky designs, making them less suitable for travel. if you know More information click the link ::[LINKED_TEXT: Operfu] [URL: https://operfu.com/difference-between-perfume-and-toilette/]"},{"prompt":"What high protein Indian vegetarian food sources are available for people that go to the gym and want to bulk up while also losing fat?","completion":"My understanding of “bulking up” is that it is a process of adding fat as well as muscle."},{"prompt":"What numbers of replications of an experiment would make the results most conclusive?","completion":"What numbers of replications of an experiment would make the results most conclusive? This isn’t really the right question. Yes, experiments must be replicated in order to be considered valid. That is absolutely correct. But, the strength of a scientific understanding comes from scrutiny, and consensus - versus a formulaic number of repetitions. This scrutiny includes… Can it be replicated (as you’ve asked about?)This usually implies, replicated by someone else. This is needed not just to avoid outright fraud by unscrupulous scientists, but to ensure quality in the performance of the experiment (see number 2.)Is the experiment well designed and performed? Simply repeating a badly designed, or badly performed experiment will confirm the same bad results. Part of what peer review is supposed to do, is flesh out experiments that are inherently flawed in their design (so they give skewed or meaningless data) and experiments that are well designed, but badly executed (I.e. your process inadvertently introduced or destroyed protein products that would significantly alter the results, etc.)Do the data warrant the conclusions made? One must remember, experiments only generate data. Then the significance of the data, and the conclusions from the data must be deduced. Significance of the data takes two forms: Statistical significance, and (for lack of a better word) meaningfulness. Statistical significance is usually annotated by a [LINKED_TEXT: p-value] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value] which (simplified) means “We see a difference between the [LINKED_TEXT: Hypothesis] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis] and the [LINKED_TEXT: Null Hypothesis] [URL: https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/null-hypothesis/]. But what is the statistical probability that (in this one experiment) this difference may have occurred just by random chance, even if there’s really no difference?” Normally a p-value of 0.05 or less is considered “statistically significant.”The “meaningfulness” is more subjective. As an example, you do an experiment to see if drug A is different (better?) than drug B. You do the experiment, and you see a statistically significant difference in “factor X” between the two drug’s. But so what? While the statistical significance of “factor X” is certain, does this difference actually change how the drug works? Is it scientifically significant? As for “how many (validations)” … this also is not really the best way to look at scientific validation. In addition to all the above formal ways, science is validated by the practical use of it. When a paper describes a new scientific conclusion, other scientists will build on that conclusion. They will recreate the experiment exactly as a form of validation, but they will also perform new research that builds on the previous discovery (which, defacto, determines if the previous discovery is “correct.”) For example, a scientist may conclude that inflammation is associated with chemical “Factor Y”. So others look at her/his paper, and agree that the experiment was well performed, and the conclusions seemed reasonable to the data. So, they start working on a drug to interfere with “factor Y” - with the assumption that removing factor Y should reduce inflammation. But, while they successfully removed factor Y with the drug, the inflammation does not decrease. So…Even though the experiment (at the time) was reproducible, and the design, execution, and conclusions were all well done … it turns out they were wrong. Maybe because of something they didn’t know yet. Maybe there is a “co-factor Z” that has to be involved too. Maybe for some other reasons. Maybe because the experiment was just wrong. But, the nice thing about science - is these things get teased out eventually. A lot of people (mistakenly) think that, “If it’s published - it’s just a scientific FACT!” But this is an oversimplification. Even if the experiment is reproducible, and the paper is well scrutinized - if enough people find the conclusions simply to not work in the real world, the “conclusion will be scrapped or otherwise altered to match what’s actually happening in the lab.” And this is wonderful because figuring out the details of why something does, or does not, work - simply leads to a better understanding of the something. There are no “failed experiments” because you always learn something from them…even if it’s that, “This means nothing. Move on. ”"},{"prompt":"What is your opinion on Facebook trying to buy major shares of Reliance Jio?","completion":"A lot of experts have analysed this deal and a lot of them have got it wrong.

A REAL CASE OF REINCARNATION OF A MUSLIM MAN INTO A HINDU FAMILY - Year: 1980 Place: Kakori, a village near Lucknow, UP The story in brief: Mushir Ali, son of Haidar Ali, was born in strict Muslim family. Mushir was the sole bread winner of the family - selling fruits on cart. When he was 25, he met with an accident - his cart collided with a tractor and he died to severe rib injuries. Less than a year later, he, now named Naresh, was born in Bazbazar in Lucknow district. When he was two years old he started praying like Muslims do during Namaz. He would also speaking in Urdu, a language his current parents or family members did not speak. When he was around four, he narrated his story of previous life to his father, Guruprasad, and mother, Bishwana. Naresh remembered his father visiting Bazbazar every Thursday to pray for other Muslims and earn his living through it. Naresh would follow Haidar and call him ‘Abba’ (Dad). But Haidar Ali refused to talk about Naresh because his religion prohibited him from acknowledge reincarnation. But Guruprasad was convinced that Naresh was Mushir Ali in his previous life. Naresh finds his Past Life Home and Identifies Past Life Relatives & Friends Guruprasad, Naresh’s father, finally decided to take him to Kakori. They were accompanied by some friends. Once in Kakori, Naresh led the group to the house where Mushir Ali lived. Inside the house, he identified several objects that belonged to Mushir, including Mushir’s cap and contents of Mushir’s suitcase. Naresh also recognized and named members of Mushir’s immediate family, relatives and friends. He also accurately told the Ali family about a bank account that the family had at the time that Mushir died. Further, Naresh mentioned the name of a person who owed money to Mushir, which the family verified. The Ali family added that this individual who owed money paid it back after Mushir’s death. And, Naresh was born with a birth mark on his chest - the spot where he was hit during his accident in his previous life. Haidar Ali accepted Naresh as his dead son Mushir’s reincarnation.

Would you mind terribly if I told more than one? OMG, what a question. My time in the IDF mirrored nothing less than the movie, “Forrest Gump”. I had some amazing experiences and very close calls, too. Looking back, I know now that G-d was definitely watching over me. Paratroopers in my time did X months of basic, (ours was shortened because of the war), including ‘sadeh’—in-the-field at the infamous, treacherous Hamam el Maliach in the summer, X months front line, X months winter training, X months front line again, X months Sergeant’s Course, then off to other places such as Rabatim, G’dud, and ‘parts unknown’. The longer you go back in time in the history of the IDF, the more you’ll see how austere and utterly harsh the conditions were for combat soldiers. During basic, in Sanur, or while in-the-field ‘somewhere in the Biq’a’, many guys could not cope any longer. I remember thinking to myself, “Wow….look at this guy. He’s a gorilla, 10x stronger than me….” But physical strength is not mental strength. So lots of those guys asked to leave, or simply disappeared ‘nifkad’. You had to be able to suffer mentally or you weren’t going to make it. You had to learn to cope with always being hungry, filthy, exhausted. Sleep deprivation is a form or torture, for sure. Sometime towards the beginning of October, after 5 grueling months of basic, our platoon filled a bus and traveled to the northwestern-most corner of Israel and crossed into Lebanon. This was our first ‘front-line’ duty. We traveled north and hooked a right at _____, then we were in the mountains. Everybody was trying to kill their neighbor. What stuck out for me was the enmity between the Christians (Israel supported) and the Druze (they serve in the IDF with honor). They were constantly ambushing each other with terrible consequences. Until you see this with the eyes in your head, you cannot comprehend it. Your mind has certain defenses so you won’t be affected by people butchering one another. All this goes out the window in Lebanon. During that time, one weekend after a Shabbat rest in Israel, I missed our bus in Tel Aviv that was going to take us back to ____ in the mountains. I got there a little late and my platoon left without me and the other stragglers, still unknown to me. So I had to hitchhike all the way to Rosh HaNikra, cross to Naqura, then somehow get to ______. I caught a tremp with some reserve-niks in a jeep. “How far are you guys going?” I asked. “Beirut”, they said. “Can you give me a ride to Sidon?” “Yallah, hop in.” When we arrived in Sidon, I got out with my Galil (my bestie at the time) and my chimidan. The jeep left. I didn’t see an IDF checkpoint. Nothing in sight. I was at the place I last remembered turning towards the mountains, but I was utterly alone. Just me and the bad guys. I already had a bullet in my chamber, but I ‘chambered’ once more, just so anybody that was watching (everybody) saw that there was a bullet ready to fire in my magazine and that I was not fucking around. I walked to the side of the road where an Arab was selling cans of pineapple juice. Then I waited eagerly on the coastal road. About 10–15 minutes later an IDF jeep pulled up. When they saw me, they asked, “WTF are you doing here alone???!” I told them what happened. Thanks be to Allah, they were continuing in my direction, east and up to the _____ . I jumped in and thanked G-d many times for saving me from what could have been a very nasty kidnapping. Although there was no Hezbollah officially at the time, I always thought that maybe the bad guys just didn’t have enough time to contact their superiors and tell them that there was an Israeli soldier alone in their village. I have other crazy experiences, we all do…..saved for another time. Unfortunately, all of these ‘happenings’ are imprinted in our memories forever. Mine were light compared to others before me. *** I have almost 200 answers on the subject of Israel.

The reason I say tobirama is 2 reasons: flying raijin and his knowledge. Let’s start with knowledge. Tobirama has more knowledge about uchiha than any other uchiha that has lived after the uchiha and senju arc. He studied the uchiha to understand what exactly makes them unique and where their power comes from. He had done many things that perfectly prove my statement like how the police precinct was so far from midtown of Konoha, how Hashirama would constantly tell him to stop hating on Uchiha, how he almost killed sasuke (yes he would have killed sasuke easily if hashirama wasn’t there but of course he can’t do that anymore). He completely understands extensively how exactly the mangekyou and normal sharingan works and how to counter it. itachi’s tsukyomi wouldn’t work first of all because he would never look in his eyes, nor any other move with eye contact. He also understand that people with mangekyou have specific powers including the susanoo so he would keep his guard and distance from him imuntil the perfect time in case of anything (like Amaterasu). Next, because of flying raijin. If you don’t know how it works basically he puts a mark on anything of matter like a shuriken or a tree and he can summon himself to where the mark has been put. Of course itachi never let anybody come in actual contact with him like taijutsu unless he is going easy (like sasuke), so tobirama couldn’t be able to put it on him, but itachi also has no knowledge of flying raijin so tobirama could then again just throw one at him and kill him. Yea funny. I know itachi would probably use genjutsu on him and once he sees his move he would completely understand it, but that doesn’t stop him. Tobirama firstly probably has very good counters for genjutsu from his knowledge plus anywhere tobirama travels he could put markers and he could put infinite and itachi just couldn’t keep up. So all his moves could not work, except maybe susanoo, but then again he can’t keep it for long. Let’s say he could keep it for 5 whole minutes. Tobirama would just keep using flying raijin to escape until his susanoo runs out. Anything itachi does is useless, plus tobirama’s huge arsenal of water type moves to counter his fire balls, and use the mist just like he did with madara’s brother. So itachi’s fire style is out, is sharingan is out, what else could he do? Not much. Don’t get me wrong itachi is very very VERY smart and strong but his arsenal is too small, he has low chakra, and he’s up against a hokage that has studied his whole life on how to stop him.

In small print, I wrote in the binding those formulas too long to easily memorize. Almost everyone in my dorm did this. NONE OF THE FORMULAS WERE OF USE ON THE EXAMS. I think all this was done on purpose. Almost all of us threw out the written-in math table books, bought replacements, and gave up on cheating. Late Junior Year we had an exam from a prof everyone feared and who changed rules frequently. The subject had a reputation of having a very tough Final. At the last class before Final, someone asked, “Professor, will this be Open Book?” “You can bring along a Visiting Professor for all the good that will do you.” That reply became famous and was repeated for years.

In fact, some studies have shown that microwave cooking can actually preserve nutrients better than other cooking methods. For example, one study found that microwaving broccoli preserved more vitamin C than boiling or steaming. Microwaves work by emitting electromagnetic radiation that causes water molecules in food to vibrate, which produces heat. This type of radiation is non-ionizing, which means it does not have enough energy to break chemical bonds in DNA. This is in contrast to ionizing radiation, such as X-rays and gamma rays, which can damage DNA and lead to cancer. There have been some concerns that microwaves may cause cancer, but these concerns have been based on animal studies and have not been shown to be true in humans. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that there is no evidence that microwaves cause cancer in humans. Of course, as with any cooking method, there are some potential risks associated with microwaving food. For example, some plastics can leach chemicals into food when heated, so it is important to use only microwave-safe plastics. Overall, there is no evidence that food cooked in a microwave oven is bad for your health. In fact, microwaving can be a convenient and healthy way to cook food. Just be sure to follow safe cooking practices and use only microwave-safe materials. Here are some tips for safe microwave cooking: Always use microwave-safe dishes and containers.Stir food halfway through cooking.Do not use metal or foil in the microwave.Avoid microwaving plastic containers that are not labeled as microwave-safe.

Except for that, modern kids are generally weak because of the social standard that has been distorted by the misinformation as well as disinformation. What I think about life is that humans need to be strong enough to endure pains they get because life has always been the ups and downs. What it means is that you can’t get the happiness, rather you must cry, frustrate and get depressed. God is really fair. I had endured those pains, but I could overcome it because I has been raised as a person who needs to be strong mentally as well as physically. Not only has it given me the endurance that can’t break me apart, but this is the long-term helper of my life and goal journey. Current society has told young people that being weak is okay.

I love reading good questions about economics, and writing about economics when I can. I’m a numbers guy and I’m fascinated by the flows of currency and how it drives our economy. But I’m disheartened by the partisan nature of much of the discussion. (Can we separate economics from politics? It’s hard.) I could probably show that you are incorrect in your assertion, but that’s not what I intend to answer. For one thing, fiscal policy is managed by Congress, and monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. The President has only indirect influence over both. For another thing, fiscal and monetary policies can influence the deficit but the deficit is really not directly attributable to Congress. There are other factors including trade and economic performance. We know that federal income taxes make up a large portion of government revenue, and taxes are reduced whenever unemployment is high. And when we have a trade deficit, more dollars are flowing out of our country than back in. As a matter of accounting, they have to be replaced somehow. (Typically, as with China, they “lend” us those dollars back by purchasing securities.) And finally we have ask ourselves whether a deficit is a bad thing. Many pundits assume it is without questioning why. Much of the public believes it will result in higher taxes, but there’s little historical precedent for that. To get to the question, let’s take a glance at the history of US sectoral balances [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #OdzfI]:The red line ([T]axes - [G]overnment spending) is the topic of this question, positive when in surplus, negative in deficit. The last surplus was year 2000. The green line represents net private savings. Blue is the foreign sector, basically trade (i[M]ports - e[X]ports). All three sum to zero, as a matter of accounting. So if Congress has their finger on the red line, and is able to move it to zero through policy, what happens to private savings and trade? How are they impacted? This is an interesting thought experiment, but cannot quite play out in reality. When discussing macroeconomics, I’m often reminded of Newton’s third law from classical physics: “Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.” Similarly here, we can’t move one sector without affecting others. Reducing spending would immediately shrink the economy and raise unemployment, reducing taxation, pushing the deficit upwards. The one constant in the chart above is trade, which has been in deficit since the early 1990’s. There are some shenanigans here, and it involves the Asian economy. The US likes cheap labor, and China has their currency pegged to ours (they buy US debt to maintain the exchange rate). This trade policy isn’t partisan though, it’s how US business operates. No matter whether a Democrat or Republican is in the White House. It’s also due to consumer preference. US consumers like cheap goods. They flock to stores like Walmart and buy cheap LED television displays for under 200. We are also a smartphone culture now, with one Apple iPhone or Samsung Galaxy or similar for almost every American, and we are accustomed to replacing them every couple years. Could we bring back the manufacturing of these goods to the US? Yes, we could. Would we pay double the price? In short, as long as we want cheap goods from Asia, we’ll probably always have a deficit. No matter who is elected to office. (Tariffs might have an influence on this but it’s too early to tell.) Stop importing goods, boost domestic manufacturing, increase our tax base, shrink unemployment to zero (and boost immigration so we’ll have the labor we need). Boom, deficit goes away (or shrinks to match private savings, but the private sector is cyclical). But is that what we really want? For a majority of Americans, I’m guessing the answer is “no”. The US is a service and consumer economy. China has a manufacturing economy. Americans enjoy a high standard of living. (We see similar divisions in Europe, where Germany for example is a strong manufacturing economy, while other EU states run a deficit.) So let’s stop pretending this is a partisan issue, please. Until and unless there is a major trade war and/or collapse of our currency, the current status quo is unlikely to change.

He then went to Makkah and afterwards went to Ash-Shams, which is where he died. 5. कुरआन के प्रसिद्ध भाष्यकार इब्ने कसीर ने मुस्नद ए अब्दुर्रज़्ज़ाक़ को उद्धृत करते हुए अपने भाष्य में लिखा है कि ‘‘ह. आदम अ. भारत की भूमि पर उतरे थे। उनका क़द बहुत लम्बा था।‘‘ ईशदूत ह. मुहम्मद स. के सत्संगिंयों तथा अन्य मुस्लिम संतों और इतिहासकारों की एक बड़ी संख्या से यहीउल्लिखित है कि पृथ्वी के पहले मानव ने, जो ईश्वर के पहले दूत भी थे, अपना पहला क़दम भारत में रखा। उन्होंने अपनी संतान में ईश-प्रदत्त सनातन धर्म (अरबी भाषा में दीन-ए क़य्यिम) का प्रचार प्रसार किया और बाद में समय समय पर संसार के विभिन्न भागों में ईशदूतों ने उसी एकईश्वरीय धर्म को पुनर्जीवित किया। आदम या आदिम शब्द, जिसका अर्थ है ‘‘सबसे पहला‘‘, भारतीय मूल का होना भी यही सिद्ध करता है कि आदि मानव भारत में उतरा। उसी को बाद में भारतीय साहित्य में आदि मनु या स्वयंभू मनु कहा गया। स्वायंभू मनु अरू सतरूपा।जिन्ह तें भै नरसृष्टि अनूपा।। दंपत्ति धरम आचरण नीका। अजहुँ गाव श्रुति जिन्ह कै लीका।। (रामचरित मानस, दो. 141, चौ. 1) अर्थात स्वायम्भूव मनु और उसकी पत्नी शत्रूपा जिन से मनुष्यों की यह अनुपम सृष्टि हुई, इन दोनों पति पत्नी के धर्म और आचरण बहुत अच्छे थे आज भी वेद जिनकी मर्यादा का गान करते हैं। In the above Hindi Quotation – Ramcharitmanas – revered book of Hinduism speaks about Adam, and his wife Hawwa. It is important to mention that hadees speaking about Prophet Adam’s descent in India has been declared weak by Muhaddesseen (those who collect Hadees); but few points that are important are: a) We don’t find any Sahi Hadees contradicting this. b) Weak / dhayeef Hadees does not mean unauthentic but absence of a few chain of narrations; lesser number of people narrating Hadees etc. c) Moreover we have seen lot of other proofs and will see further that gives strong indication towards Prophet Adam being in India.

Generally, the roads may get blocked due to heavy rains and landslides. Moreover, you may not be able to trek anywhere. So, the best duration to visit the beautiful kingdom is between October and February. Arrangements to be done beforehand while travelling to Bhutan: Booking a Hotel & Vehicle through Agency.During peak season, it’s very difficult to get hotels and vehicles on arrival. So, it’s better to book in advance at a nominal price; to be precise, decent budget hotels will charge around Rs 1,500 to 3,000 and for vehicles, it’s Rs 3,000 per day.

I knew that the society's advice: \\"go to school, get a job, work hard, get out of debt and save money\\" is BS and no one ever got rich by following this advice. AND I didn't want to work a job for 40 years to stay just above broke and settle for mediocrity, just because everyone else does. I wanted to escape the rat race and be financially free! So, One Day I woke up and promised myself that in few years I will become so filthy rich that whenever I go out whether with my friends or to buy something I do not have to look at my bank balance before swiping my credit card . I still remember that day, 26 May 2015 when I made this promise. I started working from that day and discovered the 4 most profitable businesses: Instagram, Drop Shipping, Amazon and Affiliate Marketing that made me go from broke to FILTHY RICH in just 1 year and able to achieve these figures: If I Can Earn Big Money, So Can You Things you will learn when you order \\"MILLIONAIRE SECRETS\\" TODAY INSTAGRAM &check; What is a Theme Page? &check; HACKING the Instagram Algorithm &check; How to TREND on Instagram &check; Grow from 0 to 100,000+ followers &check; Making 5,000+ from Instagram DROP SHIPPING &check; What is Drop Shippinghttps://www.digistore24.com/redir/372576/Shreyank_s/CAMPAIGNKEY] [URL: https://www.digistore24.com/redir/372576/Shreyank_s/CAMPAIGNKEY]Freelancing is also nice, it also has a huge potential.

If he is a lessee he is legally obligated to the terms of the lease and cannot be removed without renegotiating the lease. If he’s listed as an occupant, he has no legal obligation and can move out at any time. It makes no difference that he is still listed as an occupant.

Since the point is to face a no-win scenario, it’s very hard to fail. In the scenario, the prospective captain is in a situation where there appears to be a Federation civilian ship in the Neutral Zone, and it is asking for help. You need to determine whether or not to rescue the people, and how. So what happens if you turn and run? That’s actually the logical thing to do; the ship is within the Neutral Zone, you can’t find it on your sensors, and the opposing power has cloaked ships. But it is likely that doing so is the only way to “lose.” If you go after the ship, you will end up outnumbered and outgunned, by a significant margin. Your choices are to surrender, abandon ship, or fight to the death. (I think fighting to the death is probably another way to lose.) Data, when we first meet him at the start of TNG, is somewhat naive but looks mostly to logic. Most likely, he would follow the same path as Saavik in The Wrath of Khan, and end up abandoning ship. He would know the capabilities of his ship and the opposing ships, and would conclude that fighting is not going to work. He might keep the shields up inside the Neutral Zone, though, which might increase the survival time. But, yes, I assume Data could pass the Kobayashi Maru, by facing a no-win scenario."},{"prompt":"What are some constraints on innovation that are preventing us from becoming the science fiction world so many movies predicted?","completion":"Fear, the morons who run everything, lack of funding for R&D on cool inventions, laws of physics (these are movies after all)."},{"prompt":"Why am I not making any money on my affiliate marketing?","completion":"Its probably your traffic its not targeted enough.."},{"prompt":"What puzzles you most about humans?","completion":"They fight over which religion is the right one"},{"prompt":"have OpenSUSE 11.3 and Linux Mint installed on my computer, but openSUSE won't boot from the GRUB menu and just shows a black screen. How can I get both systems to boot properly?","completion":"The only correct solution is that you edit GRUB from Linux Mint, which I assume works. I guess that you installed OpenSuSE first and then Linux Mint, and something in the install process of the latter overwrote the part that booted OpenSuSE. I’m not suggesting that you necessarily did something wrong, but rather that the installation of Linux Mint was slightly too easy. It should have dealt with this setup more properly, stopped and waited for your input. But I suppose Linux Mint gives you advanced tools for managing GRUB, and you have to use those and hopefully you remember at least something about where you installed OpenSuSE, so that you can point GRUB to its root partition!."},{"prompt":"have scoliosis, how do I ensure that both sides of my lower back will be engaged equally during a back squat?","completion":"I wouldn't advise doing a squat bilaterally because of the uneven curvature causing elongation and shortening of the muscles. Therefore, one's going to be more activated than the other, and one will more likely develop spasms. I would recommend that you start strengthening the concave side of the scoliosis and stretch out the convex side to reduce the curve of the vertebral column. Additionally, depending on the severity and condition (heredity vs. imbalance), you'll need a brace or surgery to fix it. As much as it sucks, be safe and seek a therapist to help you out with modality treatment and corrective exercises."},{"prompt":"What is issuing authority in a passport?

France has 135 dailies, Mexico 420. The sheer number of newspapers worldwide suggests that not all offer digital subscriptions. The second issue is the word “always.” The New York Times was founded in September 1851. It first went digital in 2006. So for the first 155 years of its existence the NYT did not offer a digital subscription. “Always” just doesn’t cut it."},{"prompt":"w can I learn a dance?

Dennis's history document which others point, describes the sequence in detail. The summary is this: C itself is a descendant of the language B, originally created (as others have suggested) for the PDP-7. The first C compiler was written in something (short lived) that Dennis called NB or NewB. NB was written on and targeted to the PDP-11 not the PDP-7. NB was created because of deficiencies the team had run into when they moved their B code to the PDP-11. NewB was written in B, because by that time B had been written in itself. That said, Thompson original B compiler was written in PDP-7 assembler. NB was refined and gave birth to C. C itself was refined by Dennis multiple times (again described in his document). If you want an interesting project, look at the wonderful work Warren Toomey and team did with its restoration of 1st Edition UNIX can be found at [LINKED_TEXT: unix-jun72 - Restoration of 1st Edition UNIX kernel sources from pdf document. - Google Project Hosting] [URL: https://code.google.com/p/unix-jun72/] There is an early C compiler and a good deal of B and assembler code there. BTW: The Portable C Compiler (aka the Johnson Compiler) referred to by others, was not the first C compiler to be retargeted. Dennis's compiler and (what was called \\"typesetter C\\" when it was released independently from UNIX itself) was the first to be retargeted. That compiler, which was approximately the version of the Ritchie Compiler that was used in UNIX/TS (aka 7th edition) was retargeted to a Honeywell machine and the IBM 360 before PCC. I believe it was also retargeted to Interdata system when the first UNIX \\"port\\" was done. Plus many people outside of the Murray Hill, such as myself, retargeted it to the then newly emerging microprocessors to support projects we had. The first one of these I saw was a Z80 compiler from the Teletype folks circa 1977/78. I did one for an experimental chip what would become the M68000 (it was not yet named when we started the profile), although my compiler sucked at code generation (it worked good enough however). I quickly switched to a more complete implementation of the V7 C compiler that the MIT RTS guys created a year or so later. About 10-24 months after that, was when the first version of the Johnson compiler began to appear outside of the labs."},{"prompt":"What is a candid picture?","completion":"the best pose you can give for a photo is not to give a pose. that is exactly what a candid is. when you frame the subject in this case a person without his or her knowledge. but its not necessary that a candid is always a person’s photo. sometimes you are just checking your camera with some random shots and you get a picture which you never expect. i like to call that a candid too. like this"},{"prompt":"w do you politely tell your neighbor that they are mowing their grass too short?","completion":"“oh, i see you gave it a crew cut”"},{"prompt":"As a proud Texan, I believe that for profit healthcare is the best system, it allows maximum profit for shareholders and companies.

Should I sit in on his class for a day?","completion":"Yes.

I bet grades and behavior of faculty and students would improve drastically!"},{"prompt":"Did a landlord ever offer to lower your rent so that you wouldn't leave?","completion":"Actually, yes. I had been living in my apartment for 9 years and was really struggling financially. I had found a place much farther from my job that was going to charge me 50 less. I was in a pretty dire situation and 50 was literally a “make it or break it” amount. I asked my landlord to come over and we sat down and I was able to negotiate with him to take 50 off my rent so that I would not have to move. He could very well have made more money if I had left, but I had been one of those good tenants that never caused trouble. Since I had rental assistance his check was on time every month, and I did many of the minor repairs in the place without him having to deal with it. A few years later he hired a property management company to take over all of his rental units and they bumped my rent up by 350. I wasn't in quite the same financial distress as I had been previously, but it was still enough that I had to eventually move. I was there 17 years in total. I had begged him to not put my unit on that contract because there was no management required, but he did it anyway and he lost a good tenant over it."},{"prompt":"Why is there so little trash on the streets of Vancouver, British Columbia, relative to any other city, such as San Francisco?","completion":"Pride"},{"prompt":"Are atoms observable? If not, can you explain atomic theory and the history of its inception?","completion":"I am shocked that a thread like this does not mention Earnest Rutherford. So, at the risk of coming (very) late to the party and being completely ignored, let me comment on what “observable” means and why the neat images we can make today are redundant to Rutherford’s 1909 experiment. If your definition of “observable” is narrowly defined as “human observable,” then the answer to your question is “no,” and always will be, regardless of technological advancement. Atoms cannot be resolved by human eyes. You would also be classifying most modern discoveries as technically unobservable. If you have a more reasonable definition, and accept “images” like those produced by an AFM, STM, or similar, as an observation, then the answer is “yes.” But these advanced imaging techniques “observe” the surface of a material in the same way that all experiments work - they exploit a naturally occurring phenomenon to measure something useful. They don’t fundamentally add anything that Rutherford’s gold foil experiment didn’t already, as it pertains to your question. In fact, Rutherford’s experiment is somewhat more direct because he observed the nucleus, whereas modern scanners only interact with the electron cloud of the sample. What scanner do add is spatial resolution and sensitivity that Rutherford could only dream of during his time."},{"prompt":"Why do cats abandon their owners?","completion":"My family has always had cats — sometimes dogs, too. Once we got a pair of brother kittens from the local shelter. We had one other cat and two dogs at the time. When the brothers grew up, one of them started staying stay for a day or two at a time. When he returned, he was always clean, well-fed, and groomed (he had medium-long fur, so his coat needed attention). As time went on, he started staying away and longer, and eventually he stopping returning completely. He was well cared for at our house, but I’ve always figured he just found a home he liked better.

My fraternity was doing a pre-initiation ceremony at night in a public park. Nothing like what you’d see on Animal House, it was actually a really neat thing that only our chapter did and when I had gone through it myself, that’s when I remember feeling like I had really become part of the group. But, this time, I was the President of the fraternity, and when there’s a bunch of college-aged guys in a public park at night, well, some people will think the worst. I saw these two women across the street, peering towards us in the darkness. I thought, “I should go reassure them that we’re not doing anything illegal, immoral, dangerous, etc. because I don’t want them to call the cops and ruin the ceremony.” So, I walked towards them. They saw me coming a long way away. But when I got within maybe 50 feet, one of them yelled, “Run!” in fear and they took off and ran into a nearby house. I’m pretty much a teddy bear, but I’m a large one. It really hurt that they ran from me. I’m not a rapist or a violent person at all, and the assumption they made was that I was, just because of my size. I forgive them - Thinking about this from their perspective, I was a strange man approaching them from a group they were already suspicious of. But, even those of us who are thought of as being lucky to look like what we look like can be judged based on our appearance, and it hurts us too."},{"prompt":"What is the difference between perfume, eau de toilette and cologne?","completion":"Th difference is in the ratio perfume/ alcohol.

Is it okay for reading only NCERTs of 11 and 12?","completion":"NEET exam is mainly based on your NCERT books of 11th and 12th Class. Also it depends in the class you are studying. I am writing this answer considering you have one year of time for next NEET exam. Your strategy should be very clear. Devise a weekly study plan and then divide it to make a daily schedule.First make a reading from your NCERT BOOK to develop basic understanding of this book.(skimming is needed at this stage, understanding the headings).By the end you should know about the topics you have to read.Now go through your allen or aakash study material (whichever u like more do it first ). By now you should have understood your theory part.Now you solve all the numericals from the study material.(This is very important to clear your concepts). If there is any problem then refee to Ncert or your study material from allen or aakash.Now solve the numericals and examples fron the NCERT book.This should be sufficient to develop your basic understanding of your topic. Now you should be able to apply your knowledge of theory to solve numericals. For biology, you need to focus specially on NCERT.(Read it again and again) Now comes the hardest part where you need to retain the huge volume of information. You will need to revise the topics again and again. Try to complete your syllabus atleast 2 times. By now you should be able to answer majority of questions asked in exams. But this is not enough. You should enroll in test series of allen/ aakash. This will give you a study schedule to prepare accordingly. At the same time you will be able to solve new pattern questions which will keep you updated and give you much needed confidence.(After all the battle is not won in battlefield, but in the mind) If you have some time i would like to recommed you some books to boost your preparation during your final stage(few months before exam) For biology- Solve Ncert at your fingertips(This will help you retain huge amount of information from your NCERT book) But use this book only in final stages. For Physics and Chemistry, solve Universal self scorer from the beginning(only if you can manage that time). This will give you an extra edge over others.(i guess it is all about that extra edge in this cut throat competition) In last months you should give major test series of Allen and Aakash also.(many of questions are repeated from these) Remember as soom as u give a test, come home and solve the paper again. Then go to the theory part when you face difficulty in solving a question. Hope it helps."},{"prompt":"w do homosexuals decide who is the alpha; coin toss?","completion":"You know if you’re a top or a bottom or versatile pretty quick after trying some stuff.

What would the justice department seek to do if the state went ahead with their plans anyways? Have many states pushed back against the federal government?","completion":"That is a difficult question… the US Constitution is very strong in its rights of the State; the Federal Government HAS NO POWER inside the borders of the State. This has been held up in many US Supreme Court (SCOTUS) cases.The Justice department will bloviate as the Federal does, when it has no power, in trying to get the uneducated to do things they legally have no need to; example of this is the COVID vaccine mandate which actually has never been designed, signed or made a regulation, Bill or Law by the federal government.They could make claim that the act of firearms being shipped from another State gives them the right to enact and enforce laws by way of the ‘interstate commerce’ in the US Constitution… but it will be easily disregarded due to the Bill of Rights 2nd and 10th Amendments overruling that very weak case.As well the State could just have armories produce and sell firearms within its borders.

Despite its meager speeds, the vehicle paved the way for the future of cars as we know them today. Waverly Electric Anyone who thinks electric cars are an invention of the twenty-first century is sorely mistaken. The Waverly Electric was produced from 1896 to 1914 and was owned by celebrities, such as Diamond Jim Brady, Willa Cather, and Thomas Edison among its owners. Marketed as a woman-friendly automobile, The Waverly was easy to start, easy to drive, and usually come with an enclosed coach body to protect long skirts from dirt and debris. greatest cars of all time.

Not unless you are both very diligent and lucky, and you have to remain just as diligent for the long-haul. Research indicates that people who lose weight at a rate greater than 1 or 2 pounds per week are likely to re-gain much of, if not all, of that weight in the following year or two. Let me add one clarification: If you are severely obese, as I was, then it is both possible and fairly common to lose weight faster than 1 or 2 pounds per week at first. There is no downside to that, apart from the hard work that you have to do in order to achieve it. The work becomes harder and harder, however, the closer you get to your target weight. It can still be done, but that is where the likelihood of rebounding back in the other direction as soon as you become less diligent about your diet and exercise regimens kicks in. If you want to know the story about how I did that work and took off weight quickly, read on. I lost 100 pounds in 12 months. I didn't set out trying to lose weight that fast, but I was pleased that it happened. I can tell you how I did it, but you should take it only as general advice, not a specific plan, because we are all different. You (the OP of the question that I originally answered, before merge-mania took hold) asked about losing weight twice that fast, and I cannot recommend that you try that unless you are able to (a) dedicate yourself nearly full-time to the task, and (b) have medical supervision at every step along the way, along with a significant amount of help from a nutritionist and personal trainer. I started by seeing a nutritionist. She helped me by giving me three dietary guidelines, a goal for working out, and two pieces of valuable advice. The three guidelines were: cut my grain intake by 50%, double my fruit and vegetable intake, and stick to a daily calorie count of 1800-2000 per day. (The calorie goal was personalized for me, based on what my BMR would be as I approached my target weight.) The workout goal was 3 times per week, for a minimum of 30 minutes of cardio. The valuable advice was to use a program on my phone to track my calories and workouts, and to use sugarless gum as a diversion from my \\"nervous eating\\" habit. What I actually did was to cut my grain intake by more than 50%, and more than double my fruit and vegetable intake. I probably cut my grain intake to somewhere between 10 and 20% of what it was. Rice several times per week went to a small serving once a month. The same was true for pasta. Bread went down to one sandwich per week. I probably quadrupled my fruit and vegetable intake. Raw snap peas and carrots became my go-to snacks. Apples, citrus and melons became my regular desserts, apart from a once or twice per month small serving of ice cream. (Ben & Jerry's makes single-serving containers!) I used MyFitnessPal as my tracking program, and I chewed a lot of sugarless gum. The idea behind the nutritional guidelines was that they were loose enough to allow me to find what would work for me. My nutritionist's philosophy was that as long as I stuck to the calorie target, cut my grains and increased fruits and vegetables, everything else would work out. I would quickly learn how to manage my portions at meals, and what I could get away with (e.g., in terms of snacks, carbs and fatty foods) without either blowing through my target of 2000 calories or being hungry all the time. And the idea of staying above the minimum of 1800 calories per day was that I would be getting what my body needed in order to keep my metabolism from slowing down drastically. As for working out, I also went beyond the target. Instead of just 3 times per week for 30 minutes, I ended up working out five times per week for 45 to 60 minutes. It was actually easier that way, because in order to do that I had to make working out part of my routine, and if I missed a day I had to make it up right away instead of just shrugging it off. I initially intended to swim at the YMCA for my cardio, because I was afraid that my feet and knees wouldn't hold up to other types of exercise. It's very important to take any physical limitations you may already have due to your weight into account! I found, however, that I had no endurance in the pool. I could barely swim one length of the pool and back. My next choice was to try an elliptical machine, which is also relatively easy on the knees and feet, and I found I had much better endurance at that right from the start. That's not to say that I could immediately do 30 minutes at an intense pace, though. I got to 15 minutes on an easy setting the first day, and I worked up from there, getting quickly to 30 minutes, then worked my way up to 45, and eventually got to 60 - and occasionally beyond that (when I had the time). While increasing my endurance, I was slowly increasing the difficulty settings until I could do 60 minutes on a program called \\"Fat Burner\\" (on Precor elliptical machines) at a very intense rate. My knees and feet didn't give me problems, and what surprised me the most was that my asthma didn't either. My point is not, though, that you should go jump on an elliptical machine. It's that you should assess your condition, and try different workouts until you find something that you can do, and which you can push yourself to get better at. And my larger point is that you need to learn what works best for you. We are all different. Asking for advice is great, but don't seek out a step-by-step prescription that tells you exactly what to do. Learning from the advice you get, and from listening to your own body is the real key. It's doubly important because learning becomes part of your motivation. Each day is an experiment, and you are both the subject and the scientist! It's a continuous process. Things will change along the way. For example, after I got to the point where I could do an hour of intense working out on the elliptical, I tried swimming again. I found that I was able to do about 10 minutes without stopping, and I was able to build that up over a couple of months to being able to swim for an hour. It’s now more than two years later. I did a good job of keeping the weight off for a year, but it has started creeping back on. I’m still more than 80 pounds lighter than at my worst point, but I’d like to be doing better. Bicycling is now my main source of exercise. In fact, I’ve become somewhat of a fanatic about it, having ridden more than 10,000 miles in the past two years, including a seven-day / 550-mile charity ride this past summer, and I’m signed up to do it again next year! But my diet habits have not been as diligent. My late-night munching problem is my major problem in that respect. I know I have to take it on, and I know I have the wherewithal to do it, but it’s been a struggle lately. And again, I have to say that I would not try to do this in six months. That's too fast. You can't (or shouldn't) cut your calorie intake drastically below what I did, so you would have to be working out at least three times as much as I did, and that will be very hard to do. It will almost certainly be impossible, and quite dangerous, to do it on your own."},{"prompt":"w do I train a migraine alert dog?","completion":"Most of those dogs respond to issues genetically.

Don 2- Though you know somehow that the protagonist will be the winner. The climax is very well crafted for a bollywood movie. 2. A wednesday - The antagonist turns protagonist. It touches high standards when you consider the effectiveness of climax. 3. Don - Just when you think the whole movie is a good remake of the original Don ( Amitabh Bachchan starrer) the climax makes it better.

US District Judge Moxila Upadhyaya referred to Donald Trump as “Mr. Trump” and not “ Mr. President”.","completion":"“Mr.” is a respectful prefix to any man’s surname, especially in any situation where all men should be treated equally, as in a court. Other titles in the United States are social conventions. and the title “President” only belongs to the current office holder. It may be extended to former office holders at the discretion of the speaker, as are the titles Senator, General, and others. I don’t do it. It’s Mr. Bush, Mr. Clinton, Mr. Obama, and Mr. Trump. And some on that list get the “Mr.” instead of an expletive out of respect for their former office."},{"prompt":"What is your opinion on croissants?","completion":"I love eating croissants and think they are yummy.

It depends on the individuals judgement!"},{"prompt":"What is the best opening sentence you have read in a book?","completion":"‘It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife ’. Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen The beauty of these lines might not be visible in a cursory glance but these lines become important because it was written in the mid 18th century by a female writer Jane Austen. This was the era when women were considered being inferior beings not fit for writing. They had no exposure and were expected to be docile and homely. At that point in time, Jane Austen went ahead and boldly wrote about the way the institution of marriage worked in the 18th century. Instead of conforming to the ways of the world, she questioned the way things worked and did not settle for marriage for financial stability. The sassy and honest beginning of this novel adds to the beauty of this novel."},{"prompt":"f you had one wish from a genie in a bottle, what would it be?","completion":"(I got this from somewhere else, most likely Pinterest) A guy (Or possibly a girl, to avoid being sexist, but for the sake of convenience we shall say ‘guy’) contrived to lay his hands on a genie bottle one particularly fine day, at (insert place) while (insert action). As people in jokes often do, he rubbed the bottle. Or broke it. I don’t know. Either way: Lo and behold, a genie failed to not appear. And then spake the genie: “Thou shalt be granted three wishes of thy choice. Choose wisely, o mortal.” The guy probably looked a bit confused, but since it is a joke, we’ll probably never find out. Either way, the bloke proceeded to speak with great wisdom: “Nah mate. I know with you folks, you’ll grant me a wish alright, but sooner or later it’ll come back to bite me in the rear.” “I give you my word that shall not happen.” The genie rumbled solemnly. “If it does, I shall compensate you with another hundred wishes.” The bloke thought this over carefully. “Alright then,” he said finally. “I wish for a boomerang with teeth.” Silence ensued. The crickets did their job as prescribed in such situations. And then the genie spake thus: “Screw you.”"},{"prompt":"f I proved th","completion":"You can’t prove it. Just like 100% of other people who been trying to prove it can’t prove it. All the so-called “evidence” every evolutionist spews is dated. Real scientist study and get to know more about the earth each day. Some also agree that there is a possibility of the worldwide flood happening. Now you can’t say that to atheist because they are set in their ways even if you slapped them with 100% factual information. People open without bias are open to learn. As someone who does believe in God, I believe both evolution and creation can be true to a certain extent. However, that’s not the question, right? Some arguments are that the water had to reach such a high level that would be near miraculous. Last year, NASA discovered marine fossils and limestone on the highest points of the mountain, which is a good key piece of evidence supporting the Biblical flood."},{"prompt":"What are the ways the all you can eat rules are abused at buffets?","completion":"My biggest pet peeve is when people over portion and waste the food. Or when they pick through the dish to get just the meat or just the shrimp or just any item. These are a couple of ways buffets are taken advantage of. And in most cases you can’t take it home with you. There is a buffet that charges per ounce of food taken. Take all you want but pay for what you take. That would solve the problem really fast."},{"prompt":"Unreal Engine better than Unity in making an FPS game?","completion":"It depends. Every engine has their own capability. Like for programming, I definitely want to say that c# is easier than c++ as I have done them both. Then comes the visuals. If you want to go for really great visuals Then Unreal is the way to go. Unity still isn't used widely in graphics intensive games. Though they are catching up quickly. I personally myself love the UI of Unreal engine. Though I have seen people saying that the Unity has a easier to understand UI. So at last I want to say one thing, it all depends on what you want to do.

I got childhood vaccinations: Polio, TB, tetanus, etc. I am not autistic."},{"prompt":"Should you call the police to retrieve your lost cell phone if you have a tracker that took you to the location but they claim to know nothing about it?","completion":"The police will not help you retrieve your phone. Period. Your best bet is to put the phone into “lost” mode. It will emit a loud sound that can be heard for quite a distance. If you can hear it, maybe someone thinking they just scored an expensive phone will give it back. This may only work with an iPhone. Claiming a lost phone on insurance might have been something you could do at one time. My homeowners insurance is mandated to have like a 3% deductible. Yeah, on a 300,000 home that is 9,000. I believe deductibles like this are now nationwide."},{"prompt":"w should I write a speech about pets are for people who don't have children?","completion":"You shouldn't because anything you said to advance your point would be a lie. Companion animals are a great addition to any home where the people are normal, decent human beings. I was raised in a home with pets from the time I was 3 months old. My children were all raised in a home with pets their entire lives. It is a moronic concept to say pets are only for people without children."},{"prompt":"What will happen if 1 will be equal to 1 rupee?

It also commonly features four beats to a bar with each beat divided into three. ie. dah dah dah , dah dah dah, dah dah dah, dah dah dah.. Why the great European composers like Beethoven and Mozart never discovered swing puzzles me. It seems that the cliche that jazz required the combination of African plus European music in order to evolve is true. If you require a written definition of swing in order to understand all this then follow Louis Armstrong's advice and give up now. It is like colour vision. You either sense swing or you don't."},{"prompt":"Does 'nick' mean 'idiot' in British English?","completion":"Nope."},{"prompt":"Does 'nick' mean 'idiot' in British English?","completion":"No. Nick is slang for pinch of steal (“l’ll nick some bread”), or used to mean arrest (“You steal that bread and I’ll nick you”).
