In a game against the Tennessee Titans, Rosario received a handoff from quarterback Philip Rivers on 3rd-and-goal at the 1-yard line. With the entire Titans defense focused on stopping the run, Rosario was quickly hit and appeared to be stopped short of the goal line. However, the officials ruled that he had somehow managed to extend the ball across the plane of the goal line, resulting in a touchdown. The play was initially ruled a fumble recovery for a touchdown by the Titans, but after an official review, it was determined that Rosario had indeed scored. The play was officially recorded as a 1-yard touchdown run, but in reality, Rosario only traveled a few inches before breaking the plane of the goal line.

The primary driver? The considerable cost savings. Treatments cost considerably less in many countries than in the UK. Thailand is a top destination for dentures. Dental clinics in Thailand are equipped with state-of-the-art technology and offer a wide range of aesthetic options. Additionally, the cost is significantly lower than in the UK. Many patients are more than happy to trade a long-haul flight for a perfect smile and a wallet full of savings. The Czech Republic is most visited for nose jobs. It has gained a reputation for delivering quality results at an affordable price. Prices for Rhinoplasty in the UK can run as high as £7,000 or more, while in the Czech Republic the same procedure costs only about £3,000 or less. The relatively short distance from the UK makes it a favourable destination for patients who prefer to stay closer to home. While the savings in cost are significant, it's important for patients to research their chosen destination thoroughly before committing to treatment. They should explore the medical standards of their chosen clinic, hospital, or surgeon. Moreover, they must ensure that they will receive adequate pre and post operative care, as well as having the necessary aftercare at home. In summary, travelling abroad for cosmetic surgery ensures patients can have the treatment they require while also making a significant saving in cost.

This is because of European Union data protection rules. Eborders system is supposed to stop terrorists, foreign criminals and illegal immigrants getting into Britain. The system is unable to count people in and out, leaving officials in the dark about the true scale of illegal immigration. Technical problems mean people arriving on ferries, Eurostar trains, cruise ships and small planes are not screened in advance. Even when known criminals and illegals are flagged by the system, airports may not be phoned in advance to warn about their impending arrival. Nearly 650,000 Customs records about drugs and other contraband were deleted without even being read. The system is not being used to track tax fraudsters and benefits cheats going on holiday because of technical problems. Alerts about criminals and illegal immigrants may be missed because staff start dealing with them then ‘log off and go home’.","completion":"According to recent reports, 70 million passengers, which is an enormous number, are arriving in the UK without undergoing proper background checks because of EU data protection rules. This has become a growing concern for UK officials because the e-borders system, which is supposed to keep terrorists, foreign criminals, and illegal immigrants out of Britain, has been made redundant in many ways. One of the most significant issues with the e-borders system is that it cannot count people coming into and leaving the UK, which leaves officials in the dark about the real scale of illegal immigration. This is especially concerning given that technical problems make it impossible to screen passengers on ferries, Eurostar trains, cruise ships, and smaller aircraft in advance. Whenever the e-borders system does flag known criminals and illegal immigrants, there is no guarantee that airports will be notified in advance to warn them about the passengers' impending arrival. This makes it easier for them to slip through the cracks and enter the UK undetected. In addition, officials recently found that 650,000 Customs records about drugs and other contraband were deleted without even being read, because the staff did not have the time to go through them. The system is also not being used to track tax fraudsters and benefits cheats going on holiday because of technical problems, which means that these criminals can enter and leave the UK without being detected. Finally, alerts about criminals and illegal immigrants may be missed because staff start dealing with them then \\"log off and go home.\\" This means that they cannot follow up on potential leads, allowing foreign criminals and illegal immigrants to continue to enter the UK unchallenged. In conclusion, the e-borders system, which is supposed to be the first line of defense against illegal immigration, has been rendered ineffective by a combination of technical problems and EU data protection rules. As a result, UK officials have no precise way of tracking who is coming in and out of the country, which leaves the UK vulnerable to terrorists, foreign criminals, and illegal immigrants. It is high time for UK authorities to address these issues and invest in a system that works to safeguard the UK's borders."},{"prompt":"What most naturally follows?

During the early invasion period, the stirrup had not been introduced into warfare, which limited the usefulness of cavalry as shock troops because it was not possible to put the full force of the horse and rider behind blows struck by the rider. The greatest change in military affairs during the invasion period was the adoption of the Hunnic composite bow in place of the earlier, and weaker, Scythian composite bow. Another development was the increasing use of longswords and the progressive replacement of scale armour by mail armour and lamellar armour. Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable.

Components were mechanically redesigned to have small metal tabs or end caps that could be soldered directly onto the PCB surface, instead of wire leads to pass through holes. Components became much smaller and component placement on both sides of the board became more common than with throughhole mounting, allowing much smaller PCB assemblies with much higher circuit densities. Surface mounting lends itself well to a high degree of automation, reducing labor costs and greatly increasing production rates. Components can be supplied mounted on carrier tapes. Surface mount components can be about onequarter to onetenth of the size and weight of throughhole components, and passive components much cheaper; prices of semiconductor surface mount devices (SMDs) are determined more by the chip itself than the package, with little price advantage over larger packages. Some wireended components, such as 1N4148 smallsignal switch diodes, are actually significantly cheaper than SMD equivalents.

Whether you've lost a loved one or experienced a traumatic event, it's vital to prioritize self-care and surround yourself with supportive people. It's normal to feel lost and uncertain about how to grieve, but it's essential to remember that there is no \\"right\\" way to do it. Surrounding yourself with people who care about you is key to managing grief. Having a support system of understanding individuals who listen without judgement can help you process your emotions and begin to heal. If you're struggling to find people who understand what you're going through, consider joining a grief support group or online community. One of the most important things to remember when grieving is that there is no one \\"right\\" way to do it. Everyone experiences grief differently, and it's okay to find your own way of coping. Whether you prefer solitude or companionship, journaling or therapy, focus on finding the methods that work best for you. It's also essential to remember to take care of yourself while grieving. This can mean finding an activity you love and investing in it, like painting, reading, or taking up a new hobby. It can also mean making a conscious effort to get out of the house regularly, even if it's just for a brief walk. Taking care of your physical health, such as getting enough sleep and exercise, can also make a significant difference in managing grief. In conclusion, dealing with grief is never easy, but it's crucial to prioritize self-care and surround yourself with a supportive community. Remember that there is no \\"right\\" way to grieve and that everyone experiences it differently. Find your own way of coping and invest in something that brings you joy.

Arithmetic coding is a more modern coding technique that uses the mathematical calculations of a finitestate machine to produce a string of encoded bits from a series of input data symbols. It can achieve superior compression to other techniques such as the betterknown Huffman algorithm. It uses an internal memory state to avoid the need to perform a onetoone mapping of individual input symbols to distinct representations that use an integer number of bits, and it clears out the internal memory only after encoding the entire string of data symbols. Arithmetic coding applies especially well to adaptive data compression tasks where the statistics vary and are contextdependent, as it can be easily coupled with an adaptive model of the probability distribution of the input data. An early example of the use of arithmetic coding was its use as an optional (but not widely used) feature of the JPEG image coding standard.

As a result of this move, all messages from Facebook e-mail accounts will be forwarded to a user's primary e-mail address. While the company believes that this change will not have an impact on its users' experience, it may cause inconvenience for those who have been relying on the platform for communication. Facebook launched its e-mail service back in 2010 as a means of promoting itself as a one-stop-shop for its users' online communication needs. However, with the rise of popular e-mail providers such as Gmail and Outlook, the platform failed to take off. By discontinuing this feature, Facebook aims to streamline its services and concentrate on more popular tools. This would allow the company to deliver better user experience and maintain its position as the leading social media platform. In conclusion, Facebook's decision to discontinue its e-mail service reflects the company's commitment to evolve and respond to user demand.

Take advantage of balance transfers. Avoid spending too much.","completion":"Obtaining a personal loan can be a great way to finance a large purchase or consolidate high-interest debts. Personal loans typically have lower interest rates than credit cards, making them a more affordable option for borrowing money. To obtain a personal loan, you’ll need to have a good credit score and a stable source of income. A home equity line of credit (HELOC) is another option for borrowing money. If you own a home, you may be able to tap into your home’s equity to obtain a line of credit. HELOCs typically have lower interest rates than personal loans or credit cards, making them an attractive option for homeowners. However, it’s important to remember that a HELOC is secured by your home, so if you’re unable to make your payments, you could risk losing your home. Taking advantage of balance transfers can be another way to save money on interest charges. Many credit card companies offer promotional 0% interest rates on balance transfers for a limited time. By transferring high-interest credit card balances to a card with a 0% promotional rate, you can save money on interest charges and pay off your debt faster. However, it’s important to read the terms and conditions carefully, as many balance transfer offers come with fees and other restrictions. Finally, it’s important to avoid spending too much on credit. Credit cards can be a convenient way to make purchases, but it’s important to remember that every purchase comes with an interest charge. If you’re unable to pay off your credit card balance in full each month, the interest charges can quickly add up and make it difficult to get out of debt. To avoid overspending on credit, it’s important to create a budget and stick to it. Only use credit cards for purchases that you can pay off in full each month, and avoid using credit to finance lifestyle expenses that you can’t afford. By following these tips, you can take control of your finances and avoid getting into debt."},{"prompt":"As at 2016, Parliament has a fixed term of 5 years.

One statistic that shows this is the lack of touchdowns scored by the Broncos' defense. Before the game in question, which is not specified, the Broncos' defense had only scored one touchdown. This touchdown was made by safety Kareem Jackson during a game against the Houston Texans in Week 14 of the 2019 season. This lack of defensive touchdowns can be attributed to several factors. The Broncos have had to deal with injuries to key players like Von Miller and Jurrell Casey, which has affected their ability to create turnovers and score touchdowns. Additionally, the team has faced some tough opponents, making it difficult to execute on defense. Despite this, the Broncos have shown signs of improvement in recent games. In a match against the Miami Dolphins in Week 11 of the 2020 season, the defense recorded a safety and a fumble recovery for a touchdown. This brings their season total to two defensive touchdowns. While the Broncos may not have a high number of defensive touchdowns, the team's defense is still a force to be reckoned with. With players like Justin Simmons, Bradley Chubb, and A.J.

After the French and Indian War, the Proclamation of 1763 restricted settlement for Great Britain's thirteen original colonies in North America to east of the summit line of the mountains (except in the northern regions where the Great Lakes formed the boundary). Although the line was adjusted several times to take frontier settlements into account and was impossible to enforce as law, it was strongly resented by backcountry settlers throughout the Appalachians. The Proclamation Line can be seen as one of the grievances which led to the American Revolutionary War. Many frontier settlers held that the defeat of the French opened the land west of the mountains to English settlement, only to find settlement barred by the British King's proclamation.

The Adidas Jabulani was engineered as a theoretical improvement over your standard, 32panel ball. With just eight panels, it had fewer stitches, and that, supposedly, meant a lessturbulent flight through the air, Brian Palmer explains in the Washington Post. But in reality, stitches actually create fairly even turbulence all over the ball, and it flies they way players expect. This year's ball, the Adidas Brazuca, has even fewer panels—just six. But it's also rough all over with bumps made from polyurethane. Like dimples on a golf ball, they should help the ball move predictably. At least two top players, Argentina's Lionel Messi and Spain's Iker Casillas, have applauded the new ball; on the other hand, they're both paid by Adidas, Palmer notes. Fortunately, researchers in Japan have also seen good results in tests of the ball, which is made up of xshaped panels, the Los Angeles Times reports.

Allow parents to choose where their children attend to motivate schools. Support technology in the classroom to vary the learning process. Push higher standards and support STEM programs to prepare students.","completion":"Improving Education in America: Accountability, School Choice, Technology, and STEM Education The education system in America has been facing numerous challenges over the years. This has led to a decline in academic performance, which makes it difficult to prepare students for the ever-changing world. However, there are several ways that schools can be improved to create a more conducive learning environment. One of the key ways to improve schools is by holding them accountable for their performance. Schools that are underperforming need to be identified and given the necessary support to improve. This will motivate them to evolve and adjust their teaching methods to fit the needs of their students. Accountability will also create healthy competition among schools as they strive to outperform each other. School choice is another way to motivate schools to improve their performance, by allowing parents to select the best schools for their children. When parents are able to choose where their children attend, schools will be more inclined to provide the best education possible to attract more students. This competition will force schools to offer high-quality education and invest in their facilities and staff. Technology is another key factor that can be used to improve education in America. With the advancements in technology, there is a need to incorporate it into the classroom to increase the effectiveness of the learning process. Technology can be used to tailor lessons to individual student needs, as well as to provide students with a more interactive learning experience. This will keep students engaged and interested in the curriculum. Pushing for higher academic standards is also essential to prepare students for the future. Students should be challenged to achieve their full potential, and this can only be achieved through higher standards in all subjects. This will require more resources and collaboration among educators to develop curriculums that are effective and rigorous. Finally, it’s important to focus on science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education. STEM education is critical to prepare students for the rapidly changing job market. Students need to be equipped with the necessary skills to be competitive in the job market, and STEM education is the best way to achieve this. In conclusion, improving education in America requires accountability, school choice, technology, higher standards, and STEM education. These strategies will help prepare students for the future and equip them with the necessary skills to succeed in the ever-changing world."},{"prompt":"Does It is the most widely used vaccine worldwide, with more than 90% of all children being vaccinated. contain the correct answer to What percentage of kids in the whole world get the BCG vaccine?

Watch the sight glass. Turn the pump back off.","completion":"Running a pump for two minutes, watching the sight glass, and then turning off the pump may seem like a simple task, but it is actually an important maintenance step that can save you from costly and damaging consequences. The first step is to run the pump for two minutes. This allows the pump to circulate fluids and pressurize the system. During this time, it is important to keep a close eye on the sight glass. The sight glass is a small window or port located on the pump that allows you to observe the fluid flowing through the system. By watching the sight glass, you can tell whether the fluid is flowing smoothly or if there are any blockages or air bubbles in the system. If you notice any problems while monitoring the sight glass, it is important to take action immediately. If there are blockages in the system, they can lead to reduced flow rates and increased pressure, which can eventually damage the pump and other components. Similarly, air bubbles in the system can cause cavitation, which can also damage the pump and other components. After running the pump for two minutes and monitoring the sight glass, it is time to turn the pump off. This step is important because leaving the pump running for too long can cause it to overheat and wear down the components at an accelerated rate. Additionally, turning the pump off allows you to inspect it for any signs of damage or wear, which can help prevent any future problems. Overall, running a pump for two minutes, watching the sight glass, and turning off the pump may seem like a simple maintenance step, but it is an important one that can save you from costly and damaging consequences. By taking the time to perform this step regularly, you can ensure that your pump is running smoothly and efficiently for years to come."},{"prompt":"Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: How to Make Sugar and Spice Mixture for Apple Roses OPTIONS: To make the spice mixture for apple roses, simply combine sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg in a bowl and mash them together with a potato masher.

While luck and chance can play a role, you want to give yourself the best chance of success that you can. One of the most important aspects of preparing for any kind of competition is choosing the right outfit. Whether it's a sports tournament or a beauty pageant, the clothing you wear can have a big impact on your confidence levels. Make sure you choose something that makes you feel comfortable and empowered, not self-conscious or uncomfortable. Another key factor in setting yourself up for success is making sure you get there on time. Don't be late! It can add unnecessary stress to an already nerve-wracking situation. Give yourself plenty of time to get ready, weather traffic or public transportation snafus, and arrive at your destination with time to spare. When you're actually in the midst of the competition, it's important to try to relax. Easier said than done, of course, but if you can keep your stress levels low, you'll be able to perform at your peak. Take deep breaths, try yoga or meditation beforehand, or take a quick walk outside to calm your nerves. Finally, don't compare yourself to the competition. It can be tempting to constantly look at your opponents and worry about how well they're doing, but this will only add to your stress levels. Focus on yourself and your own performance, and let the judges or audience make their own decisions. In the end, you can only control yourself - so make sure you're doing everything you can to be at your best."},{"prompt":"Generate a sentence that includes all the following words: chair, garden, relaxatio","completion":"Sitting in a chair in the garden is a perfect way to achieve relaxation."},{"prompt":"ere is a premise: Mr. Pytlasinski, and don't you have, you know, by chance just a drop of that borax for a heiress from podunk Zapolandia?

They resided there in the 70s and it has since been transformed into a nature reserve. However, plans have been proposed to remove 300 lorry-loads of timber from the estate each year. Concerns have been raised by local residents about the transportation of these large quantities of timber down the single-track road. They believe that the trucks driving along it will pose a great danger, not only for other drivers but also for pedestrians and wildlife alike. This is not the first time that locals have voiced their worries, as they had previously objected to plans to build a large tree nursery on the same site. Despite these concerns, however, the project was still given the green light, much to the frustration of the residents. It is important to balance the need for economic development with the concerns of local communities. With regards to the removal of timber from the McCartney estate, it is imperative that the transportation method is carefully considered and planned. Alternative routes and schedules must be explored to ensure the safety of all those involved, as well as the surrounding environment. It is also important to note that Sir Paul McCartney is known for his activism and support for environmental causes. Therefore, it is likely that he will ensure that the transport of the timber will be carried out in an environmentally friendly manner. In conclusion, economic development should not come at the expense of safety and the environment. It is crucial that a solution is found that satisfies everyone involved, including local residents, Sir Paul McCartney, and the environment."},{"prompt":"grade round white freshwater pearl and champagne goden color rhinestone ball stretch beaded bangle bracelet Please write the text above using proper case.","completion":"A Grade Round White Freshwater Pearl and Champagne Golden Color Rhinestone Ball Stretch Beaded Bangle Bracelet."},{"prompt":"was not as good as the week befores class , because he was so opinionated and biased , I tended to dismiss in my head a lot of his key points .

Proposal part of FA Commission report on the state of the national gameAFC Wimbledon become the latest club to criticise Dyke's proposal. Chief exec Erik Samuelson says Bteams would 'wreck' Football League.","completion":"The FA Chairman, Greg Dyke, has recently proposed the introduction of Premier League ‘B-teams’ into the Football League. This recommendation is part of the FA Commission report on the current state of the national game. While some have welcomed the proposal, others have been quick to criticise it, with AFC Wimbledon being the latest club to speak out. The Chief Executive of AFC Wimbledon, Erik Samuelson, has voiced his opposition to Dyke’s idea, stating that should B-teams be introduced, it would ‘wreck’ the Football League. This sentiment has been echoed by other clubs, who argue that it would lead to a widening gap between the elite and lower leagues and make it even more challenging for smaller clubs to maintain their status. The introduction of B-teams would undoubtedly provide more opportunities for younger players to gain experience and potentially reach the top level. Still, it’s essential to consider how it would impact the wider game, whether it would undermine the integrity of the Football League, and, ultimately, whether it’s the best way to develop and nurture young talent. It’s clear that there needs to be a balance between the needs of the elite and the needs of the lower levels. The Football League must be protected, and the concerns voiced by AFC Wimbledon and others should not be ignored. It's crucial to work together to create a solution that benefits everyone and allows for the development of young footballers without destabilising the structure and integrity of the English game. Overall, while Dyke's proposal has sparked heated debate surrounding the future of English football, it’s important not to lose sight of the bigger picture. The goal must be to create a sustainable and cohesive structure that benefits all clubs, regardless of their status."},{"prompt":"Sentence 1: that's a fact Sentence 2: That's a truth.

Forgive yourself Avoid the dramatic. Acknowledge that you are your own person.","completion":"Creating attainable goals is an essential aspect of achieving success in life. It is important to set achievable targets that can be realistically accomplished within a given timeframe. By doing so, individuals can track progress and maintain motivation to keep pushing forward. In the pursuit of achieving these goals, it is equally important to forgive oneself for any setbacks or mistakes made along the way. Instead of fixating on past failures, it's important to learn from them and use that knowledge as a tool for growth. Another important factor in striving towards success is to avoid dramatic behavior. This can entail avoiding negativity and drama in personal relationships, as well as avoiding setting unrealistic expectations for oneself. High expectations can lead to disappointment and feelings of failure, which can ultimately deter one from achieving their goals. Finally, it is crucial to acknowledge that each person is unique and has their own qualities and strengths. Comparing oneself to others can be counterproductive and can potentially lead to feelings of inadequacy. Recognizing and embracing one's individuality can be a powerful motivator in achieving one's goals.

It has seen action in Bosnia, Iraq, Sierra Leone and the Philippines, earning it deserved recognition as one of the most versatile ships on the seas. Sadly, however, the vessel will be decommissioned this year, following in the footsteps of her sister ships, the HMS Invincible and the Ark Royal. Designers of the HMS Ocean have claimed that it could serve many purposes beyond just military use. Among the ideas suggested by designers is that it could double as a floating conference center and aid ship, capable of serving multiple purposes in times of peace as well as times of war. Three striking sails rising above deck would contain luxury restaurants to cater to VIPs, while the below deck could serve as a hospital or store heavy-duty vehicles and vital equipment. Several designs were submitted to the Ministry of Defense for possible use of the ship after decommissioning, with the MoD insisting that the ship be put to use, rather than being scrapped. While no final decision has been made, it is clear that the HMS Ocean will continue to be a valuable asset to the Royal Navy even after it has been taken out of service. The HMS Ocean has served its country admirably for many years, and its legacy is a testament to the commitment of the men and women of the Royal Navy.

Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow.

In the classic fluid coupling design, periods of high slippage cause the fluid flow returning from the turbine to the impeller to oppose the direction of impeller rotation, leading to a significant loss of efficiency and the generation of considerable waste heat. Under the same condition in a torque converter, the returning fluid will be redirected by the stator so that it aids the rotation of the impeller, instead of impeding it. The result is that much of the energy in the returning fluid is recovered and added to the energy being applied to the impeller by the prime mover. This action causes a substantial increase in the mass of fluid being directed to the turbine, producing an increase in output torque. Since the returning fluid is initially traveling in a direction opposite to impeller rotation, the stator will likewise attempt to counterrotate as it forces the fluid to change direction, an effect that is prevented by the oneway stator clutch.

However, simply rolling the hair and leaving it overnight is not enough. It is important to know how long to leave the rollers in your hair before removing them. Experts recommend that you wait at least eight hours before removing the rollers from your hair. This may seem like a long time, but it allows the hair to fully set and hold its shape for an extended period. Taking off the rollers too soon can result in limp and lifeless curls that don't hold up throughout the day. Waiting the full eight hours ensures that the curls are firmly set in place for the perfect hairstyle. There are several methods to speed up the setting process, such as using a hair dryer or setting spray. However, these methods should be used carefully as they can damage the hair if used excessively. In conclusion, waiting eight hours before removing rollers is crucial for achieving long-lasting and stunning curls. It may require a bit of patience, but the results will be worth it. So the next time you roll your hair, remember to wait it out and your curls will thank you!"},{"prompt":"Solve 1610*v + 588*v + 172752 = 730*v for v.","completion":"To solve for v, we will simplify and rearrange the equation: 1610v + 588v + 172752 = -730v (1610 + 588 - 730)v + 172752 = 0 1468v + 172752 = 0 1468v = -172752 v = -118 Therefore, the solution for v is -118."},{"prompt":"the following review positive or negative?

What starts out as a sweet and almost goofy romantic comedy about a Fluffer in love with his Fluffee spirals out of control into a bizarre combination of genres and a veritable stew of plots, with liberal borrowings from BOOGIE NIGHTS, THELMA AND LOUISE, SHOWGIRLS, FRISK, and even a curious dash of 400 BLOWS thrown in towards the end. (At least the director did his research!) The result is not necessarily boring but, in the end, this slick, wellproduced flick doesn't quite add up to anything.
