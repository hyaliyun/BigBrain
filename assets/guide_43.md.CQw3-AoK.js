This creates a rainbow as the light exits the prism. You can buy a prism at a science supply store, a hobby store, or online. Basic prisms are relatively inexpensive.

Travolta's son died on Grand Bahama island on January 2 after a seizure.","completion":"A paramedic is currently on trial, facing accusations of plotting to extort 25 million from Hollywood actor, John Travolta. The case has taken a shocking turn as the defendant, Tarino Lightbourn, testified that Travolta's son, Jett, had been found dead before help was even summoned. Jett Travolta had passed away on Grand Bahama island on January 2 after experiencing a seizure. What is particularly interesting about this case is the fact that defendants in the Bahamas are able to make statements without being under oath. This means that it may be difficult to determine the validity of Lightbourn's testimony. However, if it is found to be true, it could have significant implications for the case. The accusations against Lightbourn are rooted in claims that he threatened to release confidential information about Jett Travolta's death unless John Travolta paid an exorbitant sum of money. It is unclear exactly what information Lightbourn possessed, but it is clear that the allegations have caused a great deal of distress for the Travolta family. The trial has garnered significant media attention, with many people speculating about the motives behind the alleged extortion plot. Some have suggested that Lightbourn may have simply been trying to capitalize on the tragedy of Jett Travolta's death, while others believe that there may be deeper, more sinister motivations at play. Regardless of the outcome of the trial, it is clear that this case has been a difficult and painful experience for John Travolta and his family. Losing a child is never easy, and to have that loss compounded by allegations of extortion and plot-twisting only serves to make the situation even more difficult to bear. As the trial continues to unfold, many people will be watching closely to see what new revelations come to light. For now, we can only hope that justice will be served, and that the Travolta family will be able to find some measure of peace and closure in the aftermath of this tragic event."},{"prompt":"w many English kings feature in the titles of Shakespeare plays?","completion":"There are eight English kings featured in the titles of Shakespeare plays."},{"prompt":"First Date is a song by American hip hop recording artist 50 Cent, released on October 3, 2012, as a single from his upcoming sixth studio album Street King Immortal, set to be released in second quarter of 2013 after his fifth studio album, Animal Ambition.

In true Dantean form, politics stood in the way of its construction in 1938. Ironically this literatureinspired building can itself most easily be found in book form. Reading this book I remembered Goethe's quote about frozen music. Did Terragni try to freeze Dante's medieval miracle of song? Certainly a coldpoem seems artistically repulsive. Unflattering comparisons to the lake of Cocytus spring to mind too. While I cannot read Italian, I can read some German. After locating the original quotation I discovered that 'frozen' is a problematic (though common) translation of Goethe's original 'erstarrte.' The verb 'erstarren' more properly means 'to solidify' or 'to stiffen.' This suggests a chemical reaction in which the art does not necessarily chill in the transformation. Nor can simple thawing yield the original work. Like a chemical reaction it requires an artistic catalyst, a muse. Indeed the Danteum is not a physical translation of the Poem. Terragni thought it inappropriate to translate the Comedy literally into a nonliterary work. The Danteum would not be a stage set, rather Terragni generated his design from the Comedy's structure, not its finishes. Do you have any questions?","completion":"No, I do not have any questions.

It was later revealed that her memoir, titled \\"Misha: A Memoire of the Holocaust Years,\\" was mostly fictional. Defonseca's story claimed that she was a Jewish girl who wandered across Europe during World War II, searching for her parents who had been taken by the Nazis. After many hardships, she claimed to have been taken in by a pack of wolves who protected her and helped her survive. However, it was later discovered that her story was largely fabricated. She was not Jewish, did not wander across Europe during the war, and was not taken in by wolves. Her real name is Monica Ernestine Josephine De Wael, and she was born in Belgium in 1937. Despite the controversy, Defonseca's book became a bestseller and was translated into 18 languages. However, her publisher, Mt. Ivy Press, began to question the veracity of the story and filed a lawsuit seeking to recover the 22.5 that they had paid Defonseca in royalties. In 2008, a judge ruled in Defonseca's favor in the copyright case, stating that the publisher had breached their contract by not paying the full amount owed to her. However, the decision was overturned in 2018 by a Massachusetts appeals court, which found that the judge had \\"erred in not considering the evidence of fraud\\" in the case. As a result, Defonseca has now been ordered to forfeit the 22.5 she won in the copyright case.

Once you have everything you need, it is equally important to ensure the safekeeping of any parts that you remove during the project. Storing removed parts in a safe place ensures that you can easily find them when required, preventing frustration and bringing about quick completion of the task. Losing or misplacing small components can lead to difficulty in reassembly, wasted time, and money spent on replacement parts. When deciding on a secure storage location for the parts, it's good practice to keep them away from the main work area to avoid intermingling with tools and materials. You could use small plastic bags, labeling them to identify each part and its respective location. Alternatively, a parts tray or a magnetic bowl can provide a convenient and easy-to-use storage solution. In conclusion, gathering the necessary materials and storing removed parts safely are two essential steps for any DIY project or repair task.

Look for air bubbles in the hose as it drains. Repeat the process as needed.","completion":"When it comes to maintaining your vehicle's brakes, bleeding the brake system is one of the most important tasks. This process involves removing air bubbles from the brake lines, which can cause poor brake performance and even accidents. However, bleeding the brakes is not a one-time task—it requires regular attention to ensure your brakes are functioning at their best. One way to improve the effectiveness of bleeding your brakes is to add more brake fluid between each round of bleeding. This ensures that the brake lines are completely filled with brake fluid, which reduces the risk of air getting trapped in the lines again. It is important to note that adding too much brake fluid can push out existing fluid and reverse the bleeding process, so be sure to add just enough. As you bleed the brakes, keep an eye out for air bubbles in the hose as it drains. Air bubbles are a sign that there is still air in the brake line and the bleeding process should continue until all bubbles are eliminated. Be sure to check the brake fluid reservoir frequently to ensure that it remains full, as an empty reservoir can introduce air into the brake lines. Finally, repeat the bleeding process as needed. Even after you have removed all air bubbles, it is important to revisit the brake system regularly to prevent air from being reintroduced. Rebleeding the brakes every 6-12 months, or when replacing brake pads and rotors, is a good rule of thumb. In conclusion, bleeding your brakes is essential maintenance to ensure optimal brake performance, and regular attention is required to keep your brake system in top shape. Adding more brake fluid between rounds of bleeding, checking for air bubbles, and repeating the process as needed are simple steps that can make a big difference in the safety and functionality of your vehicle's brakes."},{"prompt":"Select the topic that this about: MIAMI Although Chris Rix's fumble overshadowed Xavier Beitia's blocked field goal, Florida State coach Bobby Bowden will remember them both.

If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable. Albert the Great wrote that wisdom and understanding enhance one's faith in God. According to him, these are the tools that God uses to commune with a contemplative. Love in the soul is both the cause and result of true understanding and judgement. It causes not only an intellectual knowledge of God, but a spiritual and emotional knowledge as well. Contemplation is the means whereby one can obtain this goal of understanding. Things that once seemed static and unchanging become full of possibility and perfection. The contemplative then knows that God is, but she does not know what God is.

Not only is it more humane, but it also allows for the safe release of the rodent back into the wild. When it comes to selecting a nonlethal trap, there are a variety of options available, each with their own benefits and drawbacks. Some popular choices include live traps, glue traps, and electronic traps. Regardless of the type of trap chosen, it is important to bait it with something appealing to the mouse. This could be anything from cheese to peanut butter or even a piece of bread. Once the trap has been baited, it is time to locate the mouse. Mice tend to follow the edges of walls and furniture, so placing the trap in those areas is ideal. Setting the trap is the final step in the process. When doing so, it is important to read the instructions carefully to ensure the trap is properly configured. With the trap set, there is little to do but wait. It may take some time for the mouse to take the bait and fall into the trap, so it is important to remain patient. Overall, the use of nonlethal traps is a humane and effective way of dealing with pesky mice in the home. With the proper trap and bait, catching a mouse can be a quick and easy process.

One of the modern ways to use brass in home decor is with patina. Patina is a term given to brass that has been intentionally or naturally aged to give it an antique look. This can be achieved by exposing brass to air and moisture over a long period of time or by using chemicals to accelerate the aging process. Brass with patina looks great in a variety of home styles. In a modern home, brass with patina can provide a warm, lived-in feel to an otherwise stark space. In contrast, in a more traditional home, brass with patina can add character and depth to an already established space. There are a variety of ways to incorporate brass with patina into your home decor. One popular way is to use brass accessories such as candlesticks, vases, and picture frames. These pieces can add a touch of elegance to any room and are small enough that they won't overwhelm the space. Another way to use brass with patina is with larger pieces of furniture. Brass tables and chairs can be a great addition to a living room, dining room, or bedroom. These pieces can provide a focal point in the room and can be used to create a cohesive design throughout the space. In conclusion, brass is back and better than ever.

Former Governor Bob McDonnell had designated April as Confederate History Month back in 2010, which drew criticism for omitting any mention of slavery. But now, former Governor Terry McAuliffe has issued a proclamation for Confederate History Month that acknowledges and denounces the role of slavery in fueling the Civil War. McAuliffe's proclamation reads, \\"The Confederacy's legacy has been felt in this country for generations, not only in the remnants of its ideology of white supremacy and segregation, but also in the persistent economic disparities between Black and white Americans, in the injustices committed against people of color, and in the efforts of modern-day defenders of Confederate symbols and monuments to hold onto the myth of an honorable Lost Cause.\\" In contrast, McDonnell's proclamation from over a decade ago referred only to \\"the sacrifices of Confederate leaders, soldiers and citizens\\" without acknowledging the central role of slavery in causing the war. This led to widespread criticism and condemnation, with many pointing out that it is impossible to understand the Civil War without recognizing the role of slavery. Even current Governor Ralph Northam has said that \\"you can't whitewash and ignore parts of our history that are painful,\\" although he has not made any specific proclamations about Confederate History Month during his time in office. The debate over Confederate symbols and monuments has continued to rage across the country in recent years, with many arguing that they are symbols of white supremacy and oppression. Some cities and states have chosen to remove or relocate Confederate monuments, while others have chosen to keep them as a reminder of their history. Overall, the issue of Confederate History Month and the legacy of the Confederacy remains a controversial and divisive topic in Virginia and beyond."},{"prompt":"Some international railway services to Continental Europe were operated during the 20th century as boat trains, such as the Admiraal de Ruijter to Amsterdam and the Night Ferry to Paris and Brussels.

Bituminous sands are mined using enormous (100 ton capacity) power shovels and loaded into even larger (400 ton capacity) dump trucks for movement to an upgrading facility. The process used to extract the bitumen from the sand is a hot water process originally developed by Dr. Karl Clark of the University of Alberta during the 1920s. After extraction from the sand, the bitumen is fed into a bitumen upgrader which converts it into a light crude oil equivalent. This synthetic substance is fluid enough to be transferred through conventional oil pipelines and can be fed into conventional oil refineries without any further treatment. By 2015 Canadian bitumen upgraders were producing over 1 million barrels (160×10^3 m3) per day of synthetic crude oil, of which 75% was exported to oil refineries in the United States.

Players can hold, pass, and shoot the ball, but only with one hand at a time. It's similar to basketball in that a 30-second shot clock is set, encouraging players to score quickly.

The epicoxal theory suggests the insect wings are modified epicoxal exites, a modified appendage at the base of the legs or coxa. In the Carboniferous age, some of the Meganeura dragonflies had as much as a 50 cm (20 in) wide wingspan.

The record for the longest touchdown pass in NFL history was set on November 15, 1951, by Norm Van Brocklin of the Los Angeles Rams. In a game against the New York Yanks, Van Brocklin launched a 73-yard touchdown pass to his teammate Jim Benton. This impressive feat has only been matched but never surpassed by any other player in the NFL since then. Van Brocklin’s incredible throw was a product of his natural ability, technique, and strategy. His powerful arm and precision enabled him to successfully execute such an incredible play. The fact that the record still stands over half a century later is a testament to how difficult it is to achieve such a feat. One reason why Van Brocklin's record remains unbroken is that modern football teams have different offensive strategies, with shorter, quicker passes being more common. Additionally, stronger defensive teams are using tactics such as blitzes and coverages that make it harder for quarterbacks to throw deep, limiting their opportunities for long touchdown passes. There have been many impressive long touchdown passes in NFL history, but Van Brocklin's 73-yard throw to Jim Benton remains the longest in NFL history. It is a record that has stood the test of time as only a few players have come extremely close to breaking it, but no one has yet surpassed it. Football fans will likely still be talking about Van Brocklin’s incredible record for many years to come."},{"prompt":"Carolina had a rough start in the first half, only scoring seven points, and went into halftime seventeen points behind Oakland.

Former United captain would never ask for a drink during our meetings. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Former Manchester United captain Roy Keane's upcoming autobiography, The Second Half, has already generated controversy ahead of its release on Wednesday. Keane apparently shows no remorse towards former teammate Alf-Inge Haaland, whom he infamously tackled in 2001, and also takes aim at his former boss Sir Alex Ferguson. This lack of contrition is not entirely surprising, as Keane has long been known for his no-nonsense attitude and uncompromising personality. As a ghostwriter for a feature on the player in 2001, I saw firsthand how he approached interviews with a certain level of guardedness and reluctance to open up about his personal life. However, Keane has also shown glimpses of generosity and loyalty towards those he respects. He famously gave his Champions League winner's medal from 1999 to a coach who had only positive things to say about him. Keane's communication style is also intriguing - he apparently would only contact others via fax, or would frequently change his phone number to avoid unwanted attention. And despite being known to enjoy a drink or two, Keane would never ask for one during professional meetings. As fans eagerly await the release of The Second Half, it remains to be seen what other insights Keane will share about his eventful career on and off the pitch."},{"prompt":"the following sentence linguistically acceptable?

It can affect your car's fuel efficiency, handling, and even the durability of your tires. That's why it's important to regularly check your tire pressure and adjust it as necessary. To start, attach your pump to the tire valve. You'll need to remove the valve cap first, which is often a small plastic cap that screws onto the valve stem. Once you have the pump secured to the valve, start pumping up your tire. Check the recommended tire pressure for your car, which can usually be found in the owner's manual, on a sticker inside the door jamb, or even on the tire itself. Use a tire pressure gauge to check the pressure as you pump, and adjust as necessary. It's important not to overinflate your tires, as this can be just as dangerous as underinflating them. Once you've inflated the first tire to the correct pressure, replace the valve cap and move on to the next tire. Repeat the process until all of your tires are properly inflated.

Philosophers in antiquity used the concept of force in the study of stationary and moving objects and simple machines, but thinkers such as Aristotle and Archimedes retained fundamental errors in understanding force. In part this was due to an incomplete understanding of the sometimes nonobvious force of friction, and a consequently inadequate view of the nature of natural motion. A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion, even at a constant velocity. Most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by Galileo Galilei and Sir Isaac Newton. With his mathematical insight, Sir Isaac Newton formulated laws of motion that were not improvedon for nearly three hundred years. By the early 20th century, Einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects with increasing momenta near the speed of light, and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation and inertia. 1.

It aims to land on asteroid 1999JU3 sometime in 2018 to collect samples. Samples will be returned to Earth by time Tokyo hosts Olympics in 2020. Analysing valuable cosmic material from asteroid could shed light on the mysteries surrounding solar system and its origins 4.6 billion years ago.","completion":"Hayabusa-2 to Collect Samples from Asteroid 1999JU3 In a remarkable feat of engineering, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) is sending Hayabusa-2 on a four-year voyage to collect samples from asteroid 1999JU3, which it aims to land on sometime in 2018. The spacecraft is set to be launched into space in December 2014 on a rocket that will fling it into deep space where it will travel for the next four years. Once it lands, the spacecraft will collect samples that should be returned to Earth by the time Tokyo hosts the Olympics in 2020. This will be a historic achievement, marking the first time in history that a sample will be collected from an asteroid and brought back to Earth. The analysis of the valuable cosmic material from the asteroid could shed light on the mysteries surrounding our solar system and its origins 4.6 billion years ago. The mission will involve some formidable scientific challenges. Asteroids are small, rocky bodies that have no atmosphere, making it difficult to maintain a stable landing on their surface. With the help of a range of sophisticated equipment, Hayabusa-2 will have to navigate its way safely to the asteroid and then land without causing too much disturbance. It will then collect samples using a special impactor that will be shot at the asteroid to expose material beneath the surface. The samples will be brought back to Earth where they will be analyzed to determine the chemical composition of the asteroid. Scientists hope to discover new insights into the formation of our solar system and the conditions that existed 4.6 billion years ago when the planets began to form. The asteroid itself is just a few kilometers in diameter and relatively close to Earth, which makes it an ideal target for the mission. The Hayabusa-2 mission is a testament to the ingenuity of JAXA and the power of human curiosity.

The study concluded that patients assigned to rooms with windows allowing lots of natural light had shorter postoperative hospital stays, received fewer negative evaluative comments in nurses’ notes, and took fewer potent analegesics than 23 matched patients in similar rooms with windows facing a brick wall.

Before setting sail, it is important to follow a few key steps to ensure the safety of yourself and others on board. One of the first steps when preparing to operate a boat with an outboard or inboard-outboard engine is to lower the lower unit. This helps to ensure that the propeller is fully submerged and able to propel the boat through the water. Before starting the engine, however, it is crucial to turn on the bilge blower to remove any gasoline fumes that may have accumulated in the bilge. This can prevent the risk of a fire or explosion occurring when the engine is started. Once the bilge blower has been turned on and there are no longer any fumes present, it is important to ensure that no person is near the engine when starting and that no person or boat is in your path before you put the boat in reverse. It is also essential to pay attention to currents, wind, and waves that can easily pull your boat off course and into a collision course with another boat or dock. Once everything is clear, it's time to crank the engine and get moving. However, before pulling out, it is important to secure the boat to the dock. Slowly pull the vehicle out, but keep in mind that when pulling away from the dock, the stern of the boat is pushed to one side or the other, unlike a car with a pivot point in the front.
