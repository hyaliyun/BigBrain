Mathematical objects are often examined by associating groups to them and studying the properties of the corresponding groups. For example, Henri Poincaré founded what is now called algebraic topology by introducing the fundamental group. By means of this connection, topological properties such as proximity and continuity translate into properties of groups.i[›] For example, elements of the fundamental group are represented by loops. The second image at the right shows some loops in a plane minus a point. The blue loop is considered nullhomotopic (and thus irrelevant), because it can be continuously shrunk to a point. The presence of the hole prevents the orange loop from being shrunk to a point. The fundamental group of the plane with a point deleted turns out to be infinite cyclic, generated by the orange loop (or any other loop winding once around the hole). This way, the fundamental group detects the hole.

In Gaul for instance, the invaders settled much more extensively in the northeast than in the southwest. Slavic peoples settled in Central and Eastern Europe and the Balkan Peninsula. The settlement of peoples was accompanied by changes in languages.

Try new things. Listen to music. Use acronyms.","completion":"Memory is a crucial aspect of our lives. It allows us to remember important information, recognize faces, and recall past experiences. However, sometimes we struggle to remember certain things, such as a new person's name or a phone number. Fortunately, there are various techniques that you can use to improve your memory. One effective technique is memory association. This involves building off of things that you already know and remember. For example, if you need to remember a new person's name, you could associate it with someone else you know who has the same name or with a memorable characteristic of the person. This can help make the new information more memorable and easier to recall. Visualization is another useful memory technique. By creating a mental image of something, you are more likely to remember it. For example, if you are trying to remember to pick up eggs from the grocery store, you could visualize a carton of eggs sitting on your kitchen counter. This creates a vivid image in your mind that you can recall later. Repetition is another powerful memory tool. By repeating information multiple times, you can help solidify it in your memory. For example, if you are trying to memorize a list of items, you could repeat them several times in your head or write them down multiple times. Trying new things is also beneficial for improving memory. By challenging your brain with new experiences, you are creating new neural pathways that improve cognitive function. This could be as simple as taking a different route to work or learning a new hobby. Listening to music is another technique that can enhance memory. Studies have shown that listening to certain types of music can improve focus and concentration, which can make it easier to remember information. Finally, acronyms are an excellent way to simplify complex information. By creating an acronym, you can remember a longer list of items or ideas more easily. For example, in order to remember the order of the planets in our solar system, you could use the acronym MVEMJSUN (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune). In conclusion, memory can be improved through a variety of techniques, including memory association, visualization, repetition, trying new things, listening to music, and using acronyms. By incorporating these strategies into your daily life, you can enhance your memory and recall important information more easily."},{"prompt":"it true that is the xbox one backwards compatible with xbox 360 based on the following text?

Contradicts his previous and later claims he had known it was terrorism.","completion":"CBS has recently released an interview which was shot just one day after the Benghazi attack in Libya that took place in 2012. In the said interview, the then US President, Barack Obama refused to acknowledge the incident as a terrorist attack. This statement is contradictory to his earlier and later claims where he has mentioned that he was aware of the fact that the attack was terrorism. The CBS interview was never released earlier and it has created a stir ever since it has been made public. Critics have pointed out that his statement in the interview is in contrast to what he said in his address to the nation on September 12, 2012. In his address, Obama had referred to the Benghazi incident as an “outrageous and shocking attack” and “act of terror”. The Benghazi attack took place on September 11, 2012, and led to the death of four Americans, including the US ambassador to Libya, J. Christopher Stevens. It was reported that the attack was carried out by Islamic militants and was a pre-planned act of terrorism. However, in the CBS interview, Obama refused to refer to it as a terrorist attack. The recent release of the interview has fueled the debate surrounding the Benghazi attack and the Obama administration’s response to it. Critics have alleged that the administration was not prepared for such an attack and did not take adequate measures to ensure the safety of the American personnel in Libya. In conclusion, the recent release of the CBS interview has once again brought the Benghazi incident into the spotlight. Obama’s statement in the interview contradicts with his earlier and later claims that he was aware of the fact that the attack was terrorism. It has led to renewed criticism of the Obama administration’s response to the attack and raised questions about their preparedness for such incidents."},{"prompt":"What is the sentiment of the following tweet?

Begin clipping. Continue clipping out strips. Be careful around the mane and tail. Clip the face last. Trim any remaining hairs. Clean up the hair. Blanket your horse.","completion":"Clipping Your Horse: A Simple Guide Clipping your horse can be a tricky task, but with these simple steps, you can ensure that your horse is properly groomed for any occasion. Follow these instructions to provide your horse with a clean and professional-looking coat. Start in a non-sensitive area. The best place to begin clipping your horse is in a non-sensitive area, like the neck or the shoulder. Start clipping in the direction of hair growth and move steadily along the horse's body. Begin clipping. Once you've clipped a small section, continue clipping out strips. This helps to create an even appearance and can prevent the coat from appearing patchy. Be sure to go slowly, and don't apply too much pressure. Be careful around the mane and tail. The mane and tail are sensitive areas, and it's important to be extra careful when clipping around them. Use the clippers in a downward motion when clipping the mane, and try to avoid trimming the tail as much as possible. Clip the face last. Clipping your horse's face can be the most intimidating part of the process. Start by clipping the long hairs between the horse's eyes, and then proceed to the rest of the face. Be sure to use a smaller blade and take your time, being extra careful around the eyes. Trim any remaining hairs. Once you've finished clipping your horse, there may be some stray hairs or unclipped areas. Use scissors to trim any remaining hairs and ensure that the coat appears even. Clean up the hair. Clipping generates a significant amount of hair, so it's important to clean it up thoroughly. Use a curry comb and brush to remove any loose hairs and debris. Blanket your horse. Clipping your horse's coat can leave them more susceptible to the cold. After you've cleaned up the clipped hairs, be sure to blanket your horse to keep them warm and comfortable. By following these simple steps, you can ensure that your horse looks and feels its best after being clipped. Take it slow, be careful, and enjoy the bonding experience that can come from grooming your horse."},{"prompt":"Use the following highlights to write an article: Robert Reid: Steven Slater's dramatic exit from plane (and job) was vicarious thrill for many.

Furedi: The executioner in the video appeared to have a London accent. Furedi: Many radical British Muslims reject, loathe cultural values of British society. Furedi: British leaders failed to define common purpose that can unite all parts of society.","completion":"The recent release of a video by ISIS showing the brutal and senseless beheading of journalist James Foley shocked the world. However, what made this video stand out was the apparent London accent of the executioner. This has led to discussions about the radicalization of British Muslims and their rejection of British cultural values. According to sociologist Frank Furedi, many radical British Muslims reject and loathe the cultural values of British society. Furedi argues that this rejection is not based on religious differences but on a deeper sense of disaffection with British society. Some British Muslims feel disillusioned with the lack of opportunities to fully integrate into society, and others feel that British society discriminates against them. Furthermore, Furedi contends that British leaders have failed to define a common purpose that can unite all parts of society. This failure has allowed radicalization to grow, and the broader society is now paying the price. The lack of a common purpose has also contributed to the sense of disaffection among some British Muslims, making them more susceptible to extremist ideologies. In conclusion, the horrific events surrounding James Foley's death have highlighted the issues of radicalization and disaffection within British society. The apparent involvement of a British citizen in such a heinous act has shocked the country, but it is important to understand the underlying issues that led to this event. We must address these issues head-on, and leaders must work to define a common purpose that unites all members of society, regardless of their background or beliefs."},{"prompt":"Based on the premise The executive is responsible for ensuring that program integrity initiatives and policies are implemented, assessed through an effective internal control process, and adjusted as necessary to achieve appropriate results., can we conclude the hypothesis The executive has no responsibility for the implementation of policies. is true?

After Katrina, National Guard was out in force and hospital ship was available, he says. FEMA workers complain they have difficulty reaching Sandy storm victims, he says.","completion":"In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré, who headed up the military response in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, questioned why New York had ignored the lessons learned from Katrina. In particular, he criticized the lack of a centralized command center in the wake of the disaster, with nobody clearly in charge of the recovery effort. Honoré noted that after Katrina, the National Guard was out in force and a hospital ship was available to provide medical care to those in need. In contrast, he saw no such presence during the Sandy recovery effort. Additionally, he cited complaints from FEMA workers who were struggling to reach storm victims and provide them with assistance. Honoré's comments highlight the importance of having a clear and coordinated response to a natural disaster. Without a central command center, it can be difficult to ensure that relief efforts are reaching those who need them most. The presence of the National Guard and other military resources can also be critical in providing assistance and support to affected communities. While New York may have learned some lessons from Katrina, Honoré's comments suggest that there is still much work to be done in terms of disaster preparedness and response. Moving forward, it will be essential to take these insights into account and to develop a more effective and coordinated approach to disaster relief. Only then can we hope to mitigate the devastating effects of natural disasters and ensure that those in need receive the support and assistance they require."},{"prompt":"Answer a question about this article: Nasser made Egypt fully independent of British influence, and the country became a major power in the developing world under his leadership.

One such tool is an alphabet chart that can be downloaded and printed out for personal practice. When beginning to learn, it is best to start with the letters that look similar to their Latin counterparts. These letters can provide a solid foundation to build from. Once these letters have been mastered, the next step is to add the three Bulgarian vowels. This will increase familiarity with the language and enhance one's ability to read and pronounce words correctly. It is then time to move on to letters that look like Latin letters but sound different. This can be challenging, but with consistent practice, it can be conquered. The remaining six single consonants are the next target for mastery.

However, before taping your toes, it's important to determine if it's appropriate for your specific situation. Consulting with a healthcare professional is recommended to ensure that taping won't make your condition worse or delay proper treatment. Assuming taping is appropriate, the first step is to clean your feet and toes thoroughly. This will help prevent any infections or skin irritation that can occur from dirt, sweat, or oils on the skin. It's best to use mild soap and warm water and dry your feet completely before proceeding. Next, place some gauze or felt between your pinky and fourth toes. This can help reduce friction and rubbing, which is often the cause of blisters, corns, or calluses between the toes. Make sure to use soft materials to avoid any discomfort. After placing the gauze, tape your pinky and fourth toes together using medical tape. This can help support the foot's arch and reduce stress on the toes or joints in the foot. It's important not to tape the toes too tightly, as this can affect blood circulation or cause discomfort. Finally, change the gauze and tape daily. This will help prevent any buildup of bacteria or moisture, which can cause infections or skin irritation. It's also a good idea to check your toes regularly, looking for any signs of irritation, blisters, or soreness. In conclusion, taping your toes can be a helpful solution for reducing pain or discomfort caused by various foot conditions. However, it's important to determine if taping is appropriate for your specific situation and to consult with a healthcare professional. It's also important to clean your feet and toes, place some gauze or felt between your toes, tape them together properly, and change the gauze and tape daily to prevent any complications."},{"prompt":"Use the following highlights to write an article: Tree in town of Tenterden adorned with blazing bulbs.

The company has a reputation for taking a lighthearted approach to the often-serious business of space travel, and this latest move is just one example of their playful spirit. Aside from the cheese, the Dragon capsule made history by becoming the first commercial spacecraft to be recovered from Earth orbit.

This should be done through a rigorous testing process to ensure that the app functions as intended and does not have any glitches that could cause frustration for users. Once the app has been tested and is functioning properly, it is important to convert it to other platforms to reach a wider audience.

The way that researchers are doing this is by infecting pathogenic bacteria with their own viruses, more specifically, bacteriophages. Bacteriophages, also known simply as phages, are precisely bacterial viruses that infect bacteria by disrupting pathogenic bacterium lytic cycles. By disrupting the lytic cycles of bacterium, phages destroy their metabolism, which eventually results in the cell's death. Phages will insert their DNA into the bacterium, allowing their DNA to be transcribed. Once their DNA is transcribed the cell will proceed to make new phages and as soon as they are ready to be released, the cell will lyse. One of the worries about using phages to fight pathogens is that the phages will infect good bacteria, or the bacteria that are important in the everyday function of human beings. However, studies have proven that phages are very specific when they target bacteria, which makes researchers confident that bacteriophage therapy is the definite route to defeating antibiotic resistant bacteria.

With just a few simple steps, you can whip up a delicious batch of vanilla syrup that's perfect for adding extra sweetness to coffee, tea, pancakes, waffles, and more. To get started, gather the following ingredients: - 1 cup of granulated sugar - 1 cup of water - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract Once you have your ingredients prepped, grab a medium-sized saucepan and begin by combining the sugar and water inside. Give the mixture a good stir, ensuring that all of the sugar is fully dissolved before moving on. Next, turn your stove burner to high heat and bring the saucepan to a boil. Once the mixture has started to boil, reduce the stove heat to medium-low and let the syrup simmer for about 10-15 minutes. This allows the syrup to thicken up somewhat, giving it a rich and smooth consistency. While the syrup is simmering, you can add your teaspoon of vanilla extract into the mix. Once the syrup has thickened to your desired consistency, remove the saucepan from the heat and let it cool down for a few minutes. Once the syrup has cooled down a bit, you can then transfer it to a glass jar or bottle for storage. Remember to let the syrup cool down completely before storing to prevent condensation from forming and spoiling the syrup. Now that you have your homemade vanilla syrup ready, you can add it to your favorite drinks or desserts for an extra touch of sweetness. Try adding it to some sparkling water for a refreshing vanilla soda or drizzle it over some vanilla ice cream for a decadent dessert.

It is also important to wrap a towel around your neck and shoulders to protect your clothing. Next, arrange your mirrors to ensure you have a good view of the back of your head. To begin trimming your curls, start by separating the trimmed curls from the untrimmed curls. This can be done by clipping up the sections of hair that you do not plan to trim. This will make it easier to focus on the curls you want to trim. Before cutting your hair, shake out your curls to ensure they are free of any tangles. Use a comb or brush to gently separate any stubborn knots. Once your curls are smooth and untangled, you can begin the trimming process. When trimming your curls, it is important to inspect each curl carefully. Look for split ends and damaged hair that needs to be removed. Take small sections of your hair and trim only a small amount at a time to avoid cutting too much off. After trimming each curl, shake it out again to ensure it still looks even and natural. Continue this process until all of your curls are trimmed and shaped the way you want them. In conclusion, trimming curly hair can be a delicate process that requires patience and attention to detail. By following these steps, you can ensure that your curls look healthy and well-maintained.

In a stepper motor an internal rotor containing PMs or a magnetically soft rotor with salient poles is controlled by a set of external magnets that are switched electronically. A stepper motor may also be thought of as a cross between a DC electric motor and a rotary solenoid. As each coil is energized in turn, the rotor aligns itself with the magnetic field produced by the energized field winding. Unlike a synchronous motor, in its application, the stepper motor may not rotate continuously; instead, it steps—starts and then quickly stops again—from one position to the next as field windings are energized and deenergized in sequence. Depending on the sequence, the rotor may turn forwards or backwards, and it may change direction, stop, speed up or slow down arbitrarily at any time.

Applying puppy psychology to partner can train them the same way. 'Women should create scarcity; reward good and ignore bad behaviour'","completion":"Sloan Sheridan-Williams, a leading life coach, suggests applying the principles of puppy psychology to train your partner. The concept revolves around creating scarcity and using positive reinforcement to reward good behavior and ignoring bad behavior. According to Sloan, women should create scarcity in their relationships. They should make their partners aware that their attention and affection are valuable, and they are not always readily available. Creating scarcity makes the partner realize the value of the relationship and can keep them interested and engaged. The principles of puppy psychology can also be applied while training a partner. Positive reinforcement is a powerful tool in shaping the behavior of dogs, and the same can be applied to humans. It is important to reward good behavior and ignore or redirect bad behavior. The idea is to acknowledge and praise your partner when they do something good, reinforcing the positive behavior. At the same time, if the partner does something undesirable, it is important to ignore the bad behavior, redirect them or withhold the reward, emphasizing that the behavior is unacceptable. This approach to training can be highly effective in building healthier, happier relationships. It is important to create a safe, secure and loving environment where both partners feel valued, appreciated and respected. The principles of puppy psychology can be used as a tool to enhance communication, increase intimacy and build stronger connections. In conclusion, applying the principles of puppy psychology in your relationship can be effective in building a stronger and healthier partnership. Creating scarcity, using positive reinforcement to reward good behavior and ignoring bad behavior can help to build a more meaningful and fulfilling relationship, where both parties feel valued and respected. Working towards better communication and mutual respect is key to building and maintaining a loving and fulfilling relationship."},{"prompt":"knows what it takes When Michigan quarterback Matt Gutierrez talks about the formula that his alma mater, De La Salle High School, has used to win a startling 151 games in a row, he talks meat and potatoes.

In the National Football League (NFL), the team that has scored the most points via field goals is the New England Patriots. As of the end of the 2020-2021 NFL season, the Patriots had a total of 1,381 points scored through field goals. In other leagues, such as the Canadian Football League (CFL) or the Arena Football League (AFL), the team with the most points scored through field goals may be different. However, the same principle applies in that the team with the most accurate and consistent field goal kicker, as well as a strong offensive strategy that can position the team for field goal attempts, is likely to have the highest number of points scored through field goals. Overall, the number of points scored through field goals may not always be the most important metric for determining a team's success. Other factors, such as touchdowns scored or defensive performance, may have a greater impact on the outcome of a game. Nonetheless, having a reliable and skilled field goal kicker can make a significant difference in a team's ability to score points and ultimately win games."},{"prompt":"Sentence 1: An appropriation act is the most common means of providing budget authority, but in some cases the authorizing legislation itself provides the budget authority.

This information comes from a recent analysis of the current NFL season, which found that the Ravens have scored ten field goals in the third quarter of their games. This is a significant achievement, as field goals are an important part of any team's scoring strategy. While touchdowns are typically seen as the most exciting way to score points in football, field goals can also make a huge difference in the outcome of a game. In fact, many close matches have been won or lost due to successful or missed field goals. Of course, it's worth noting that this information is based on a specific point in the season, and that the number of field goals kicked by teams can fluctuate over time. Additionally, other factors like weather conditions or injuries to key players can make a big difference in a team's ability to score field goals. Despite these caveats, however, it's clear that the Baltimore Ravens have been successful in scoring field goals in the third quarter. Whether this will continue throughout the rest of the season remains to be seen, but for now, the Ravens can feel confident in their ability to get points on the board when it matters most."},{"prompt":"Continue writing the next sentence.

Yet more than 1 billion worth of this invented currency is in circulation—more than the entire currency stock of 20 countries, Fox News reports. A single bitcoin is currently worth more than 90 US. What's the appeal?

With any technology, he says, criminals are going to use it for something. TechCrunch has more background on how the system works.","completion":"Bitcoin: The Virtual Currency Taking Over the World Bitcoin, a virtual currency that was created without any national treasury backing, is taking over the world.

Even today, astronomical periods identified by Mesopotamian protoscientists are still widely used in Western calendars such as the solar year and the lunar month. Using these data they developed arithmetical methods to compute the changing length of daylight in the course of the year and to predict the appearances and disappearances of the Moon and planets and eclipses of the Sun and Moon. Only a few astronomers' names are known, such as that of Kidinnu, a Chaldean astronomer and mathematician. Kiddinu's value for the solar year is in use for today's calendars.
