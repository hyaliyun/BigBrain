Protect the ends of your hair. Avoid chemicals, heat, and high manipulation.","completion":"Moisturize, Protect, and Avoid are the three essential tips for maintaining healthy hair. One of the most critical factors for healthy hair is moisture. Moisturizing your hair regularly helps to keep it hydrated, soft and shiny. A good moisturizer should include natural ingredients such as aloe vera, shea butter, and coconut oil. Apply the moisturizer to your hair strands, especially the ends, to keep them from drying out. Protecting the ends of your hair is equally important. The ends of your hair are the oldest part of your hair, and they need to be protected to prevent breakage and split ends. To protect your hair ends, you can wear a protective hairstyle like braids, twists or buns. You can also use hair accessories like satin caps, headbands, or hairbands to protect your hair while sleeping or exercising. Avoiding chemicals, heat, and high manipulation is essential to keeping your hair healthy. Chemical treatments like relaxers, hair dyes, and perms can strip your hair of natural oils, leading to dryness and breakage. Instead, opt for natural hair color and try to avoid chemical treatments as much as possible. Also, minimize the use of heat styling tools such as flat irons, curling irons, and blow dryers, which can damage your hair. Instead, try to air dry or use low heat when styling your hair. Finally, try to avoid high manipulation of your hair. High manipulation refers to excessive brushing, combing, and styling of your hair. Over-manipulating your hair can lead to breakage and hair loss. Instead, use a gentle detangling brush or wide-tooth comb to avoid pulling your hair. Protective hairstyles like braids and buns can also reduce the need for excessive styling. In conclusion, moisturize, protect and avoid are the three essential tips for maintaining healthy hair. By following these simple tips, you can keep your hair hydrated, soft, and shiny, while preventing breakage, split ends, and hair loss. So, make sure to incorporate these tips into your hair care routine and enjoy healthy, beautiful hair."},{"prompt":"the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? for the breezy and amateurish feel of an after school special on the subject of tolerance OPTIONS: negative positive","completion":"Negative."},{"prompt":"Concepts: footballer, react, session Write a sentence that includes all these words.","completion":"During a football training session, a good footballer should react quickly to the coach's instructions."},{"prompt":"Use this fact to answer the question: digestion is when stomach acid breaks down food Which is likely to be digested?

One common problem that many people face is discoloration of the nails. This can happen due to various reasons such as excessive use of nail paint, exposure to chemicals, or illness. However, this can be easily remedied by soaking your nails in a solution of lemon juice and baking soda. To do this, take equal amounts of lemon juice and baking soda and mix them together to form a paste. Then, soak your nails in the mixture for about 10 to 15 minutes. The lemon juice works as a natural bleach and helps to remove any stains or discoloration on the nails. The baking soda acts as an exfoliator and helps to remove any dead skin cells. After soaking your nails, gently buff the top of your gel manicure with a nail buffer. This will help to remove the dingy layer that has formed on your manicure over time. Be careful not to over-buff your nails as this can damage the gel layer. Once you have finished buffing your nails, apply a layer of topcoat over your manicure. This will help to seal in the gel color and protect it from any further damage. In conclusion, maintaining the health and appearance of your nails is essential. A simple solution to remove any discoloration is to soak your nails in a mixture of lemon juice and baking soda.

In an interview with Total Politics magazine, the Mayor hinted that he intends to return to the Commons at the next General Election. This thinly veiled message to the Education Secretary follows comments made by him last month, where he stated that the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, was ‘incapable of focusing’. The Mayor’s comments suggest that he is concerned about the Education Secretary’s loose talk and is calling for him to support the Prime Minister as the country faces significant challenges, particularly with Brexit negotiations. The Mayor’s comments are likely to fuel speculation about his own future aspirations, with many suggesting that he is preparing for a return to national politics. However, the Mayor has made it clear that his current focus is on the needs of the people of London, particularly with regards to issues such as housing, transport and safety. Despite this, the Mayor’s comments will be seen as another sign of the growing tension within the Conservative Party, as the leadership battle heats up. It remains to be seen how the Education Secretary will respond to the Mayor’s message, but it is clear that he will need to be more careful with his words if he wants to maintain his position within the party. Overall, the Mayor’s comments highlight the challenges facing the Conservative Party as they look towards the next General Election. With Brexit negotiations continuing to dominate the political agenda, the party will need to work together in order to deliver a successful outcome for the country.

The wage gap between men and women has been a widely debated topic in recent years, and this data further solidifies the fact that there is still work to be done to provide equal pay for both genders. Studies have shown that women in the workforce are often paid less than their male counterparts for the same job. This is known as the gender pay gap, and it affects a vast number of women in various employment sectors. Women who work full-time in the United States earn, on average, 82 cents for every dollar earned by men. Additionally, this wage gap is even wider for women of color, with African American women earning only 63 cents and Latina women earning only 54 cents for every dollar earned by white, non-Hispanic men. In the county, the median income for females was 43,000, while the median income for males was 51,000. This means that the median income for women was 8,000 less than that of men, indicating that women face an uphill battle when it comes to earning wages that are equal to their male counterparts. While there has been progress made toward closing the gender pay gap, much work still needs to be done on both an individual and societal level. Women must be empowered to negotiate for better wages and benefits, and employers must work to eliminate bias in their hiring and promotion practices.

Knowing this helps them tell direction. Many animals have natural 'compasses' that work just as well. Birds like the garden warbler in Figure 1.36 use Earths magnetic field. They use it to guide their annual migrations. Recent research suggests that warblers and other migrating birds have structures in their eyes. These structures let them see Earths magnetic field as a visual pattern. Question: According to this passage, what protects the organisms of Earth from harmful particles given off by the sun?

During his career, Wilkins was known for his accurate and powerful field goal kicks, which often helped his team secure important victories. But just how far did Wilkins' field goals typically travel? To answer this question, we can look at Wilkins' career statistics. According to NFL.com, Wilkins attempted 362 field goals during the regular season, making 265 of them for a career field goal percentage of 73.2%. The average distance of those field goals was 37.6 yards. However, it's worth noting that Wilkins played during a time when the NFL used narrower goalposts than it does today. In 2014, the league widened the distance between the goalposts from 18 feet, 6 inches to 23 feet, 4 inches, making it slightly easier for kickers to make field goals. This means that if Wilkins played today, his average field goal distance might be slightly shorter. Despite this, there's no denying that Jeff Wilkins was an extremely talented kicker who could make field goals from impressive distances. In fact, he holds the record for the longest field goal in St. Louis Rams history, having kicked a 57-yard field goal against the San Diego Chargers in 2004. Overall, while the exact distance of Jeff Wilkins' field goals varied from kick to kick, his average field goal distance during his career was 37.6 yards.

Push yourself physically. Reject or replace unwanted thoughts. Meditate. Focus on virtues.","completion":"Resisting short-term temptations can be incredibly challenging, especially in today's fast-paced and ever-changing world. However, it is a vital skill to develop if we want to live fulfilling lives and achieve our long-term goals. One effective way to do this is by creating “if-then” plans. This involves anticipating potential distractions or temptations and planning ahead for how to deal with them. For example, if you know you struggle with staying focused during work, you could create an “if-then” plan such as “if I feel distracted, then I will take a quick break and come back to my work in 10 minutes.” This helps to remove the decision-making process in the moment, making it easier to stay on track. Another crucial aspect of resisting short-term temptations is delaying gratification. This means resisting the urge to give in to immediate desires, such as scrolling through social media instead of studying. It can be challenging, but studies have shown that those who can delay gratification are more likely to achieve long-term success and happiness. Paying attention to your body is also key in resisting short-term temptations. This involves being aware of your physical needs, such as getting enough sleep, eating healthy foods, and exercising regularly. When we take care of our bodies, we are better equipped to resist distractions and urges that may derail us from our goals. Physical exercise is another powerful tool in resisting short-term temptations. When we challenge ourselves physically, our mental toughness and discipline are also strengthened. This can help us stay focused and motivated to resist distractions and temptations. It's important to note that unwanted thoughts often contribute to short-term temptations. When we have negative, self-defeating thoughts, we are more likely to give in to immediate desires. To combat this, focus on rejecting or replacing these unwanted thoughts with positive, encouraging ones. Meditation is another helpful practice that can aid in resisting short-term temptations. Meditation allows us to focus our minds and develop greater self-awareness. This can help us resist distractions and stay on track with our goals. Finally, focusing on virtues can also help us resist short-term temptations. Values such as perseverance, self-discipline, and integrity can motivate us to resist distractions and stay committed to our goals. In conclusion, resisting short-term temptations is a crucial skill to develop if we want to achieve long-term success and happiness. By creating “if-then” plans, delaying gratification, paying attention to our bodies, exercising regularly, rejecting unwanted thoughts, meditating, and focusing on virtues, we can better equip ourselves to stay focused and motivated despite distractions and temptations."},{"prompt":"f A young male is sipping on a juice., does it logically follow that The guy is sipping on gin and juice.?

Although every state has its own laws and procedures when it comes to filing for divorce, there are some general steps that you can follow to make the process easier. One of the first things that you need to do when filing for divorce is to visit the court clerk's office in the county where you live. The clerk's office is responsible for handling all filings in the local court system, including divorce. When you visit the clerk's office, you should ask for the necessary forms to file for divorce. Typically, these forms will include a petition for divorce and other documents that you must fill out and submit to the court. Once you have obtained the forms, you should fill them out carefully and thoroughly, making sure to provide accurate information about your marriage, your assets and debts, and your children (if you have any). After filling out the forms, you should file them with the clerk's office. Some courts allow you to file by mail, while others require you to file in person. Make sure that you follow the court's instructions carefully, and pay any filing fees that are required. Failing to pay the fee or submitting incomplete forms can delay your divorce and add more stress to the process. It is essential to keep copies of all documents related to your divorce, including the petition for divorce, any responses that your spouse files, and any court orders issued by the judge. These documents can be crucial in proving your case and protecting your rights, so keep them in a safe place where you can access them easily. Finally, it's crucial to stay organized throughout the entire divorce process. Keep track of deadlines, court dates, and other important information, and communicate with your attorney (if you have one) regularly.

Soon, Holy Roman Imperial forces joined the battle and conquered the members of the Schmalkaldic League, oppressing and exiling many German Lutherans as they enforced the terms of the Augsburg Interim. Religious freedom was secured for Lutherans through the Peace of Passau in 1552, and under the Cuius regio, eius religio and Declaratio Ferdinandei clauses of the Peace of Augsburg in 1555. Religious disputes between the CryptoCalvinists, Philippists, Sacramentarians, Ubiquitarians and GnesioLutherans raged within Lutheranism during the middle of the 16th century. This finally ended with the resolution of the issues in the Formula of Concord. Large numbers of politically and religiously influential leaders met together, debated, and resolved these topics on the basis of Scripture, resulting in the Formula, which over 8,000 leaders signed.

In a brave move, Shaunna has chosen to publish the same pictures that were previously shared online. By doing so, she hopes to start a conversation about the harmful effects of revenge porn and the need for greater protection for victims. Unfortunately, the House of Lords recently rejected calls to make revenge porn a criminal offence.

Revenge porn is a serious issue that can have far-reaching consequences for victims. It can lead to feelings of shame and embarrassment, damage career prospects, and even result in physical harm. Those who share intimate pictures without consent must be held accountable for their actions, and victims must be given the support and protection they need to move forward. Shaunna's decision to speak out about her experience is a powerful reminder of the need for greater awareness and understanding of the issue. We must work together to create a society where revenge porn is not tolerated and victims are given the support and protection they need to heal.

Ecologically, the agricultural productivity of the Sumerian lands was being compromised as a result of rising salinity. Soil salinity in this region had been long recognized as a major problem. Poorly drained irrigated soils, in an arid climate with high levels of evaporation, led to the buildup of dissolved salts in the soil, eventually reducing agricultural yields severely. During the Akkadian and Ur III phases, there was a shift from the cultivation of wheat to the more salttolerant barley, but this was insufficient, and during the period from 2100 BC to 1700 BC, it is estimated that the population in this area declined by nearly three fifths. This greatly upset the balance of power within the region, weakening the areas where Sumerian was spoken, and comparatively strengthening those where Akkadian was the major language.

Lloyds insists email 'in no way representative of behaviour' Bank has launched an internal investigation and is taking disciplinary action. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Lloyds Banking Group is facing scrutiny after a leaked email revealed that employees were encouraged to make as many appointments as possible and set referral targets for passing customers to another department. The email, sent by an unnamed regional manager to a branch, came a week after the bank's bill for mis-selling payment protection insurance (PPI) topped £10 billion. The email warned staff who failed to meet the targets that their bonuses would be cut. It is unclear how many employees were involved or how widespread the practice was. Lloyds has launched an internal investigation and is taking disciplinary action. The bank has been under pressure over its handling of the PPI scandal, which has seen it set aside billions of pounds to compensate customers who were sold the insurance policies alongside loans and credit cards. Lloyds has been the hardest hit by the scandal, accounting for more than half of the total PPI bill across the industry. A spokesperson for Lloyds insisted that the email was \\"in no way representative of behaviour\\" across the bank and that it took its regulatory responsibilities \\"extremely seriously\\". However, the incident is likely to further damage the bank's already tarnished reputation and raise questions about its corporate culture. The email is just the latest in a series of scandals to hit the banking industry, which has been struggling to regain public trust in the wake of the financial crisis. Banks have been criticised for a range of unethical practices, including mis-selling financial products, rigging interest rates and engaging in money laundering. The incident serves as a reminder that the banking industry must take responsibility for its actions and strive to rebuild public trust. Transparency, accountability and ethical behaviour must be the cornerstones of any corporate culture and banks must work to ensure that they are upheld at all times. Only then can the industry begin to repair its damaged reputation and regain the trust of its customers."},{"prompt":"AP On the campaign trail, belting out promises for the next four years, President Bush exudes confidence and optimism.

Thousands of CSAs offer fruits and vegetables, but few sell meat. Members say they like health and environmental bonuses to buying local. Cost, location can limit communitysupported farming, expert says.","completion":"Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA) is an innovative way to buy fresh and organic produce directly from farmers in your area. It is a mutually beneficial relationship between the farmers and the consumers. Members buy a share of the season’s harvest, and in turn, farmers receive financial support upfront to cover their production costs. The produce is then delivered weekly to convenient pickup locations for members to enjoy. One of the most significant advantages of community-supported agriculture is that it allows members to buy locally grown fruits and vegetables. This not only supports local farmers, but it also fosters a sense of community and creates a direct relationship between consumers and producers. Members of CSAs develop a sense of pride and ownership in their local food system. However, despite the many benefits of CSAs, there are few that offer meat options for members. While thousands of CSAs offer seasonal fruits and vegetables, only a handful provide local, sustainably raised meat. This can be due to the higher production costs associated with raising animals, and the additional regulations involved in meat processing. Despite this limitation, members of community-supported agriculture programs appreciate the health and environmental bonuses associated with buying local. By supporting local farmers, members can rest assured that their food is grown without the use of harmful chemicals and pesticides. This translates to a healthier, more nutritious, and more flavorful product. Additionally, buying from local farms reduces the carbon footprint associated with transporting food across long distances. While the benefits of community-supported agriculture are vast, it is important to note that cost and location can be limiting factors. Shares can range in price depending on the location, and many CSAs require members to pick up their produce at a designated location, which may not be convenient for everyone. In conclusion, community-supported agriculture is an excellent way to support local farmers and buy fresh, organic produce. While there are limitations when it comes to sourcing local meat and the costs and availability of programs, the health and environmental benefits of participating in a CSA are worth considering. It is essential to be aware of the limitations and work within them to create a more sustainable and localized food system."},{"prompt":"What are the most important words in the following sentence: young man dancing on the beach with women at sunrise","completion":"young man, dancing, beach, women, sunrise."},{"prompt":"Daley married Anne Marie ( 19181986 ) , parents of Blanche Daigle , Rosemary , Daniel and Timothy in 1945 .

Kids learn healthy habits from those they admire most, and Santa is a role model. Culture may already be changing with Santa races, healthy gifts. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Santa Claus as a Role Model for Healthy Habits According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 12.5 million children in the United States are obese. This alarming statistic highlights the need for healthy role models for children, and Santa Claus may be one such role model. Children often learn healthy habits from those they admire most, and for many kids, Santa Claus is a beloved figure. While traditionally known for his round belly and love of cookies, Santa is also a symbol of kindness, generosity, and joy. By portraying Santa as someone who values health and wellness, we can promote positive habits in children and help address the obesity epidemic. One way that culture may already be changing is through the growing popularity of \\"Santa races\\" and other holiday-themed fitness events. These events encourage participants to dress up as Santa Claus or other holiday characters and run a race or complete a fitness challenge. Not only do these events promote physical activity, but they also inject some fun and festivity into traditional exercise routines. Another way that we can promote healthy habits through Santa Claus is by encouraging the giving of healthy gifts. Instead of sugary treats or high-calorie snacks, consider gifting children with items that promote physical activity, like jump ropes or sports equipment. By associating Santa with healthy gifts, we can show children that health and wellness are important values to uphold. In conclusion, while Santa Claus may not be the first figure that comes to mind when we think of healthy habits, he has the potential to be a powerful role model for children. By portraying Santa as someone who values health and wellness, we can help promote positive habits and combat the obesity epidemic."},{"prompt":"Question: Which species of birds were recorded 3,000 years ago?

One common question that comes up is how to address couples correctly. According to tradition, couples should be addressed as \\"Mr. and Mrs. HisFirstName HisLastName\\". This means using the husband's first and last name after \\"Mr. and Mrs.\\". However, it's important to be aware that some women prefer to keep their own last name after getting married. In this case, it's best to use \\"Ms.\\" before her first name instead of \\"Mrs.\\" using her husband's last name. It's also important to note that addressing a woman as \\"Mrs.\\" followed by her first and last name can imply that she's divorced, which could be a sensitive issue. It's always a good idea to do some research or ask the couple directly how they prefer to be addressed on the invitations.

If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable. Breathing is largely driven by the muscular diaphragm, which divides the thorax from the abdominal cavity, forming a dome with its convexity towards the thorax. Contraction of the diaphragm flattens the dome, increasing the volume of the cavity in which the lung is enclosed. Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities; it flows through the larynx, trachea and bronchi and expands the alveoli. Relaxation of the diaphragm has the opposite effect, passively recoiling during normal breathing. During exercise, the abdominal wall contracts, increasing visceral pressure on the diaphragm, thus forcing the air out more quickly and forcefully. The rib cage itself also is able to expand and contract the thoracic cavity to some degree, through the action of other respiratory and accessory respiratory muscles. As a result, air is sucked into or expelled out of the lungs, always moving down its pressure gradient. This type of lung is known as a bellows lung as it resembles a blacksmith's bellows. Mammals take oxygen into their lungs, and discard carbon dioxide.

This dominance creating what is now England and leaving culturally British enclaves only in the north of what is now England, in Cornwall and what is now known as Wales. Ireland had been unaffected by the Romans except, significantly, having been Christianised, traditionally by the RomanoBriton, Saint Patrick.
