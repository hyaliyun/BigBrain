According to experts, there is a 20 to 50 per cent chance of a decade-long drought, which would be worse than any the region has experienced in the last 2,000 years. US authorities have been advised to start planning for the possibility of a megadrought, which would have significant consequences for agriculture, water resources, and the broader economy. The warnings come as almost 60 per cent of California is facing \\"exceptional\\" drought conditions for the third year in a row. Dry weather and high temperatures have resulted in depleted snowpack in the Sierra Nevada mountain range, which usually provides one-third of the state's water supply. Record-breaking wildfires are also plaguing the region, worsening air quality and causing power outages. The risks of a megadrought are not just confined to California: studies have shown that other areas of the Southwest US, such as Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, are also highly vulnerable. The impacts of a prolonged drought could be felt across the US, as the region produces a significant proportion of the country's fruits, vegetables, and nuts, as well as being home to critical military installations and energy infrastructure. To mitigate the risks, experts are calling for immediate actions, including measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and greater investment in water conservation and storage. The US government is also being urged to increase funding for research on climate change impacts and adaptation strategies. Overall, the megadrought warning serves as a stark reminder that climate change is not a distant threat, but a present reality that requires immediate action to avoid catastrophic consequences."},{"prompt":"ere is a premise: 3 children on brick street, near a lamp post, trashcan and some adults.

They come in two types: hot cathode and cold cathode. In the hot cathode version an electrically heated filament produces an electron beam. The electrons travel through the gauge and ionize gas molecules around them. The resulting ions are collected at a negative electrode. The current depends on the number of ions, which depends on the pressure in the gauge. Hot cathode gauges are accurate from 10−3 torr to 10−10 torr. The principle behind cold cathode version is the same, except that electrons are produced in a discharge created by a high voltage electrical discharge. Cold cathode gauges are accurate from 10−2 torr to 10−9 torr. Ionization gauge calibration is very sensitive to construction geometry, chemical composition of gases being measured, corrosion and surface deposits. Their calibration can be invalidated by activation at atmospheric pressure or low vacuum. The composition of gases at high vacuums will usually be unpredictable, so a mass spectrometer must be used in conjunction with the ionization gauge for accurate measurement.

But worry not, with these simple steps, you can achieve perfectly cooked hard-boiled eggs every time. Firstly, place 6 to 8 eggs in a medium saucepan and cover them with water. It is important to add enough water to completely cover the eggs, so they cook evenly. Next, add a splash of distilled white vinegar to the water.

Bell told his mother the fearless assault was the 'biggest fluke alive' He died just five days later in similar attack near Contalmaison, France. Soldier's memorial will have a new stone and plaque honouring his efforts.","completion":"Article Title: Donald Bell - The Courageous Footballer Who Became a War Hero Donald Bell, the only English professional footballer to be awarded the Victoria Cross, left a legacy that transcends sports. Bell played for Crystal Palace, Newcastle United and Bradford Park Avenue, but it was his valiant service during World War I that earned him the highest military honour in the British Commonwealth. Bell was one of the 2,000 players who answered Lord Kitchener's call to arms at the outbreak of war. In 1916, he was serving with the 9th Battalion of the West Yorkshire Regiment when he showed extraordinary bravery during the battle of the Somme. On 5 July 1916, Bell's platoon was ordered to attack the German-held village of Contalmaison. Despite heavy enemy fire, Bell led a charge towards a machine-gun post that was causing heavy losses to his comrades. Single-handedly, he cleared the post and captured nine prisoners. When Bell returned to his lines, he told his mother that the fearless assault was the \\"biggest fluke alive.\\" But his heroism did not go unnoticed. Bell was awarded the Victoria Cross for his outstanding bravery and leadership. Sadly, Bell's gallantry was short-lived. Just five days after his heroic deed, Bell was killed in action during a similar attack near Contalmaison. He was only 22 years old. Bell's legacy, however, lives on. His name is remembered on the Thiepval Memorial in France, which commemorates the 72,000 missing British and South African soldiers who died in the Somme and have no known graves. In addition, a soldier's memorial in his hometown will have a new stone and plaque honouring his efforts. Donald Bell's exemplary bravery epitomises the selflessness and indomitable spirit of those who served in the First World War. We will always remember and honour his courage and sacrifice, both on the football field and on the battlefield."},{"prompt":"Use the following highlights to write an article: European food experts say it is ‘safe for human consumption’ Has been used as sugar alternative for 30 years.

According to historical records, the war against Aragon cost approximately 3 million livres tournois (LT) in the mid-15th century. On the other hand, the war against England over Gascony, which lasted for decades from the late 14th century to the early 15th century, cost a staggering 22 million LT. When these figures are combined, the war against Aragon and the war against England over Gascony cost a total of 25 million LT. This was a considerable sum of money, especially considering that the French monarchy was generally mired in debt and financial difficulties during this era. It is worth noting, however, that the cost of these wars was not just measured in financial terms. They also had significant human costs in terms of lives lost, displaced populations, and generalized societal disruption. Overall, the combination of the war against Aragon and the war against England over Gascony was a significant drain on the resources of the French monarchy during the late medieval era.

Bony's agent has confirmed that he expects the deal to be completed within days, once small financial details are resolved. This will be good news for Manchester City, who have been looking to strengthen their attacking options for some time. Bony has been in excellent form for Swansea this season, scoring nine goals in 20 appearances, and his proven ability at the highest level will undoubtedly be an asset to the champions. The fee, which is likely to exceed Swansea's previous record sale of £15m for Joe Allen, demonstrates the escalating financial power of the Premier League's top clubs. The transfer will also be a significant blow to Garry Monk's side, who will need to find a replacement quickly if they are to continue their impressive challenge for a European spot this season.

After scoring 25 goals in his debut season, he has continued to impress and will now join one of the most exciting squads in European football. While Bony's transfer may have a short-term cost for Swansea, it is an important reminder of the club's ability to spot talent and develop players for the top level.

Learn about massy particles.","completion":"The Planck constant is a fundamental constant of nature that holds significant importance in the field of physics. Its value, derived through experiments and calculations, provides a measure of the quantum mechanical behavior of photons and other particles. Understanding the physical significance of the Planck constant is key to comprehending its implications in various contexts. One critical area where the Planck constant is relevant is the study of massy particles. Mass is a fundamental property of matter, and particles with mass are subject to the laws of classical mechanics. However, when we examine particles at the quantum level, their behavior becomes more complex, and the Planck constant comes into play. In particular, the Planck constant determines the uncertainty of a particle's position and momentum, and its value is inversely proportional to that uncertainty. Therefore, the more precisely we know a particle's position, the less we know about its momentum, and vice versa. This relationship is known as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. By learning about the Planck constant and its impact on massy particles and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, we gain deeper insights into the fundamental nature of the universe. Moreover, we can apply this knowledge to phenomena ranging from particle physics to the behavior of electrons in solids. In sum, the Planck constant is a fascinating, and essential, concept in physics that merits study and exploration."},{"prompt":"Context:And wonderful with children .

He stated that it would be \\"simply not fair\\" to leave this issue unaddressed.

Both Clegg and the Prime Minister, David Cameron, seem to be aware of the backlash they may face from Tory backbenchers over the proposed \\"devo max\\" or further devolution to Scotland, which could include areas such as taxation and welfare policy. It is evident that any proposed changes regarding Scottish powers will require a delicate and considerate approach, especially given the potential backlash from various political factions. With the recent Scottish independence referendum fuelling discussions over devolution and the role of Scottish MPs in Westminster, it is important to ensure that the interests of all constituent nations of the UK are considered in any constitutional reform. This includes carefully assessing the impact that Scottish devolution could potentially have on the rest of the UK and ensuring that any changes are fair and balanced. As discussions continue, it is clear that caution and sensitivity are required to ensure that the best outcome is reached for all parties involved.

The smell of freshly baked bread permeates your home and instantly puts you in a relaxed mood. Making bread from scratch can seem intimidating, but with a little practice, you can create delicious loaves that your family will love. Here are the steps to follow to make bread from scratch. First, break the bread into three pieces. Then, let the pieces rise for 10 to 15 minutes. This step allows the yeast to activate and start the fermentation process that makes the dough rise. Next, roll the pieces into cylinders and shape each cylinder. This step creates the classic bread shape, and it's important to make sure the cylinders are consistent in size and shape. Arrange the dough in a baking pan and let it rise more. This second rise helps develop the bread's structure and creates the characteristic crust of a loaf of bread. This step can take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the temperature and humidity in your kitchen. Finally, bake your bread at 375 °F (191 °C) for 35 to 40 minutes. This temperature and bake time will create a golden-brown crust and a soft, fluffy interior. After baking, let your bread cool on a wire rack so that the steam can escape, and the crust can cool and become crisp.

Wiseman was reportedly hit in the eye during the performance and has undergone three operations in an effort to restore his sight. Unfortunately, he remains legally blind. The incident occurred at an event organized by a company that specializes in staging realistic sword fights for entertainment purposes. While the event was intended to be a fun and engaging experience for audiences, the lack of safety precautions has left one attendee permanently injured. According to Wiseman's lawyers, the company failed to provide adequate protection for spectators, particularly those seated close to the performance area. They also claim that the company did not provide sufficient guidance to performers to prevent scenarios like this from happening. The consequences of this incident are severe. Wiseman has experienced significant medical expenses and has been unable to work since the injury. While the lawsuit seeks monetary compensation for the damages suffered, it also raises important questions about the responsibility of companies to protect their customers and ensure that their events are safe. It is often easy to overlook safety measures when planning events, particularly ones that are meant to be exciting and immersive experiences. However, incidents like these are a clear reminder of the need to prioritize safety at all times. As consumers, we should expect nothing less than a safe and secure environment when attending events of any kind.

The move is expected to help the company manage the financial fallout of the leak. According to Dorothy Brown, a professor of law at Emory University, it is impossible to accurately estimate how much liability BP faces for the oil leak. She added that the damage is already done, and it is now a matter of who is going to bear the cost. Brown also noted that the bulk of BP’s dividends go to people who have high income, which is why she supports the decision to suspend the payments.

Therefore, it is important that the companies allocate resources to cover any liabilities that may arise as a result of these accidents.

He is known for his military prowess and successful conquests of neighboring kingdoms. When it comes to his army, Bayinnaung had a diverse set of soldiers including horses and elephants. However, records suggest that he had more elephants than horses in his army. Elephants were a crucial part of warfare in Southeast Asia, and Bayinnaung recognized their importance. Elephants served various purposes in his army. Firstly, they were used as transportation to carry soldiers and equipment across difficult terrains such as jungles and rivers. Moreover, elephants were also used to intimidate enemies and create fear on the battlefield. A group of charging elephants was a formidable sight, and their trumpeting and size could break the morale of enemy troops. Horses, on the other hand, were primarily used by the cavalry units in Bayinnaung's army. They served as fast and agile mounts that could move quickly and attack enemies from a distance. However, horses were not as crucial in Southeast Asian warfare as they were in other parts of the world, such as Europe or the Middle East. This is because the terrain in Southeast Asia was not as conducive to horse riding, and there were other modes of transportation available, such as elephants and watercraft. In conclusion, Bayinnaung had more elephants than horses in his army. Elephants played a vital role in Southeast Asian warfare, serving as transportation, weapons and intimidation tools.

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Travelling solo can be liberating and exciting, but single supplements can make it an expensive venture. However, there are ways to save money when booking travel as a solo traveller. One of the ways is to keep an eye out for companies that drop single supplements for the first few people who book. This is a common practice, particularly with hotels and cruise lines, as they try to fill up their inventory early on. Booking early not only saves you money, but it also gives you more choices and better availability. Another way to save money on single supplements is to travel during the off-season. Many tour companies and hotels offer discounts for solo travellers during the less busy times of the year. Beach resorts, for instance, are often cheaper in the fall or winter months, and some tour companies may even offer incentives such as free upgrades or excursions to entice solo travellers. Tour companies based in Europe are also less likely to charge a single supplement. This is because travelling solo is more common in Europe than in other parts of the world, and tour operators have adapted to this demand. European tour companies may offer shared accommodation options or provide single rooms without additional fees. Travelling as a solo traveller can be a fantastic experience, rich with opportunities for personal growth and adventure. And with a little research and planning, it doesn't have to break the bank.

Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, Corbyn warned that low-paid and insecure jobs would be particularly vulnerable to the effects of increased migration. Corbyn called for rules allowing temporary work agencies to pay foreign workers less than their UK counterparts to be changed. He argued that this practice puts UK workers at a disadvantage and called for a level playing field for all workers irrespective of their country of origin. The Labour leader's comments come as immigration remains a key issue in the upcoming EU referendum. Both the Leave and Remain camps have been keen to make their positions on immigration clear, with the Leave campaign arguing that leaving the EU would allow the UK to take control of its borders and reduce immigration levels. Meanwhile, Prime Minister David Cameron has once again refused to give a specific figure on how many migrants he expects to arrive in the UK in the coming years. Instead, he stressed the importance of the proposed \\"emergency brake\\" on immigrant numbers, which would allow the UK to limit migration from within the EU if it is deemed to be putting public services under excessive strain. With just a few weeks to go before the referendum, it is clear that immigration will remain a key issue for both camps.

This is the standard size for most computer speakers. Next, examine the input panel on the back of your HDTV and see what types of sockets it has. There should be an HDMI socket for video and one or more types of audio sockets, such as an optical socket, coaxial socket, or RCA (red and white) sockets. Once you have connected your PS3 to your HDTV through your preferred method, such as HDMI or AV cables, locate the 1/8th inch socket on the HDTV's input panel. This is where you will connect the headphone jack from your computer speakers. Insert the jack and turn on your PS3. Once it has booted up, select a game, movie, or TV show to watch. If your HDTV is set up to output audio through the 1/8th inch socket, you should now hear all the audio signals from your television, including those coming from the PS3, through the computer speakers. This quick and easy hack can provide a significant improvement to your audio experience while using your PS3. By bypassing the built-in speakers on your HDTV and using your computer speakers, you can achieve a surround sound effect or a clearer and more powerful sound output. Enjoy your gaming and viewing experience even more with this simple yet effective hack."},{"prompt":"Does Inﬂuenced by Philinus of Cos (ﬂ. 250), a student of Herophilos, a new medical sect emerged, the Empiric school, which was based on strict observation and rejected unseen causes of the Dogmatic school. correctly answer the question of Which school of medicine was based on strict observation?

Click on Layers in the menu bar. Click on Duplicate Layer… in the dropdown and click on OK.","completion":"Opening an image in Photoshop and duplicating it is a simple and useful task that allows you to make changes to a copy of the original image while keeping the original intact. To begin, you need to open the desired image in Photoshop by selecting File > Open from the menu bar, browsing your files and selecting the image you want to work on. Once you have the image open, click on Layers in the menu bar located at the top of your screen. Layers are like transparent sheets stacked on top of each other, and with each layer, you can add different effects, filters or edits without changing the original image. By duplicating a layer, you can make changes on the copy and keep them separate from the original image. Next, in the Layers panel, you will see the name of your background layer, which is the layer your image is currently on. Click on the background layer and drag it onto the New Layer button located at the bottom of the Layers panel. This duplicates the background layer. Another way to duplicate a layer is by clicking on the Layers panel menu icon (the three horizontal lines) and selecting Duplicate Layer…. A pop-up window will appear asking you to name your duplicate layer. You can either use the name it suggests or choose your own. Once you’ve given your new layer a name, click on OK, and the duplicate layer will appear in the Layers panel. You can use this new layer to make changes, add effects, or remove parts of the image, and if you make a mistake or change your mind, the original image is still available on the background layer.

Seed bombs are small balls made of soil and seeds that can be thrown or planted into soil to grow into beautiful and beneficial plants. To create your own seed bombs, you can either buy pre-made seed packets or harvest seeds from fruits and vegetables you already have at home. Once you have your seeds, soak them for an hour or overnight in a warm, weak solution of seaweed or compost tea. This will help the seeds to germinate faster and encourage stronger growth. Next, it's time to prepare the seed bombs themselves. All you need is a mix of soil and clay that will hold the seeds together. The ratio should be around 3 parts soil to 1 part clay. Mix the two together, gradually adding water until you reach a consistency that can be formed into small balls. Then, it's time to add in the seeds! Roll the mixture into small balls, making sure to evenly distribute the seeds throughout each ball. You can also add in other beneficial elements such as worm castings, rock dust, or mycorrhizal fungi to provide added nutrients and support to your plants. Allow the seed bombs to dry out for at least 24 hours before planting. When you're ready to plant, simply toss the seed bombs onto bare soil or gently press them into the ground, making sure they are covered with a light layer of soil. Make sure to water them well and watch for the growth! Planting seed bombs is a great way to add some color and life to your yard or garden, while also supporting local ecosystems and pollinators.

Many had made predictions about what the rate would be by the end of the year, but their estimates were proven to be off by several points. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the unemployment rate for December 2011 was 8.5 percent. This was down from the peak of 10 percent in October 2009, but still higher than pre-recession levels. However, this number was lower than what many economists had predicted. In January 2011, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) predicted that the unemployment rate would end the year at 9 percent. Similarly, the Federal Reserve's projections showed a rate of 8.6 to 8.9 percent. These estimates were based on various factors such as GDP growth, consumer spending, and business investment. However, as the year progressed, unemployment declined faster than expected, reaching 8.6 percent in November and ultimately falling to 8.5 percent in December. This was a significant deviation from the estimates made earlier in the year. While economists undoubtedly strive to make accurate predictions, the complexity and unpredictability of the economy can make it challenging to do so. In this case, the unemployment rate in 2011 turned out better than expected, but it remains to be seen whether future predictions will be as accurate."},{"prompt":"Answer a question about this article: Noted 19thcentury mosaics include those by Edward BurneJones at St Pauls within the Walls in Rome.

The question of which gender is more affected by RA is a common one, and the answer is clear: women are more frequently affected by RA than men. According to studies, women are three times more likely to be diagnosed with RA than men. In fact, RA is one of the most common autoimmune diseases in women, and it typically develops between the ages of 30 and 60. Men, on the other hand, tend to develop RA later in life and with less frequency. The reason for this gender disparity is not fully understood, but there are several theories. One is that hormones play a role in the development of RA. For example, estrogen levels have been shown to affect the immune system, which could increase the risk of RA in women. Additionally, women who have been pregnant have a lower risk of developing RA, which suggests that pregnancy hormones may have a protective effect. Another theory is that genetic factors may increase the risk of RA in women. Some studies have found that certain genes are more strongly associated with RA in women than in men. Regardless of the exact cause, it is clear that RA affects women more frequently than men.

Add more sugar to the sauce. Substitute cream for the milk.","completion":"Changing the ingredients in a recipe can completely transform the taste and texture of a dish. Three ways to alter a recipe and improve its flavor are reducing the amount of milk, adding more sugar to the sauce, and substituting cream for milk. Reducing the amount of milk in a recipe can help thicken sauces and soups. By using less milk, the dish can also have a richer, creamier taste. This method is useful when making dishes such as macaroni and cheese, creamed spinach, or clam chowder. By using less milk, the sauce or soup can have a more indulgent flavor and texture. Adding more sugar to the sauce can also improve the taste of a dish. Sugar is used in many sauces to balance out the acidity or bitterness of ingredients such as tomatoes or vinegar. Additionally, adding sugar to baking recipes such as cookies or cakes can enhance their flavor and make them more enjoyable. Just be careful not to over-sweeten the dish, as too much sugar can overpower the other flavors. Substituting cream for milk is another technique that can improve the texture and taste of a recipe. Cream is thicker and richer than milk, and can give dishes like pasta sauces, soups, and desserts a velvety texture. Additionally, some people prefer the taste of cream over milk, as it has a sweeter, nuttier flavor. In conclusion, modifying a recipe by reducing the amount of milk, adding more sugar to the sauce, or substituting cream for milk can make a significant difference in the overall flavor and texture of the dish. These simple changes can make an average recipe into an extraordinary one, and can open up a world of new flavors and possibilities for your cooking adventures."},{"prompt":"651 I am sought of them that asked not for me I am found of them that sought me not I said Behold me behold me unto a nation that was not called by my name Add punctuatio","completion":"\\"651: I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name.\\""},{"prompt":"Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?

They put his desire to return to jail down to nostalgia.","completion":"In the ongoing case of notorious serial killer Ian Brady, his legal team has accused the authorities of making him a \\"special case\\". This comes after the hospital treating the 79-year-old insisted that his mental illness was incurable, thereby rejecting his request to be transferred to a Scottish prison. Brady is known for the heinous murders of five children in the 1960s, along with his accomplice Myra Hindley. He has spent the past few decades at a hospital in Merseyside, where he has been undergoing treatment for mental illness. His legal team has argued that Brady's request should be granted, as he wishes to die in prison and has no interest in receiving treatment. However, lawyers for the hospital have dismissed this, stating that his desire to return to jail is nothing but nostalgia. The case has been ongoing for quite some time now, with several appeals by Brady and his legal team being rejected by the hospital and the justice system. The hospital has placed significant emphasis on the fact that Brady's mental condition is chronic and incurable, and that his transfer to a different facility could jeopardize his wellbeing. Meanwhile, Brady's victims' families continue to voice their opposition to the possible transfer, stating that it would be an insult to the memory of their loved ones. The case has once again reignited the debate on the ethical treatment of criminals, and the rights of victims and their families. In conclusion, the Brady case remains a contentious issue, with his legal team and hospital authorities at loggerheads over his transfer. While the authorities insist on prioritizing his health and wellbeing, his lawyers remain committed to their client's wish to transfer to a Scottish jail. The final decision is still pending, and it is likely to be a while before the issue is resolved."},{"prompt":"lørdagden6.november2010 Please segment the words.","completion":"lørdag - den - 6. - november - 2010"},{"prompt":"A mule is the offspring of a male donkey (jack) and a female horse (mare).
