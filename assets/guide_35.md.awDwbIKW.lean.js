She is returning to campaigning after a sixmonth break from the 'emotionally draining' work.","completion":"Talitha Stone: The Activist Who Faced Online Abuse In 2014, Talitha Stone made headlines when she protested against the scheduled performances of Tyler the Creator and Snoop Lion in Australia. The young activist argued that their lyrics were misogynistic and promoted violence against women. Her efforts paid off when Tyler the Creator's visa was canceled, and Snoop Lion's tour down under was reduced to just two shows. However, Stone's victory was short-lived as she became the target of vicious online abuse. Stone, who was 25 at the time, received thousands of hateful messages on Twitter. People called her names, threatened her safety, and even posted images of her face photoshopped onto pornographic material. The harassment was so relentless that Stone was afraid to leave her home or turn on her computer. In recent years, we have become increasingly aware of online harassment and the toll it takes on the individuals who experience it. However, back in 2014, Stone's case was a stark reminder of the dangers of online abuse. Despite the trauma she experienced, Stone has since spoken publicly about the impact the backlash had on her. She described it as \\"emotionally draining\\" and revealed that she had taken a six-month break from campaigning. However, she has recently returned to activism, calling for more sustainable and ethical fashion practices. Stone's story is an important reminder of the price that some activists pay for challenging the status quo. However, her resilience and determination are also inspiring, and her return to the public arena serves as an example of how we can overcome adversity. We need more people like Talitha Stone who are willing to speak out for what they believe in, even in the face of angry opposition."},{"prompt":"ere is a premise: A boy doing a skateboarding trick on a city sidewalk.

Fans of both teams are always eager to see how their favorite squad fared statistically at the end of a game. When it comes to which team scored more offensive yards, the answer is the Dallas Cowboys. According to NFL statistics from the 2020 season, the Cowboys recorded a total offensive yardage of 6,131 yards. On the other hand, the San Francisco 49ers recorded a total offensive yardage of 5,259 yards. This means that the Dallas Cowboys outperformed the 49ers on the offensive side of the ball. It is worth noting that while offensive yardage is an essential stat, it is not the only factor that determines success in a game. A team can score more offensive yards than their opponent and still fail to win the game. Defensive play, special teams, and turnovers can all have a significant impact on the outcome of a match. Additionally, it is important to remember that offensive yardage is just one metric used to evaluate a team's performance. Other statistics, such as points per game, third-down conversion rate, and time of possession, can also provide valuable insights into a team's success. In conclusion, the Dallas Cowboys scored more offensive yards than the San Francisco 49ers during the 2020 NFL season. While this is an essential measure of performance, it is not the only factor that determines a team's success. When evaluating a team's overall performance, it is essential to consider multiple metrics and factors."},{"prompt":"Question: what are the names of the twin towers??

Use a color preserving detergent or vinegar. Wash jeans with other garments. Use the lowest spin cycle and temperature.","completion":"Jeans are a staple item in most people's wardrobes, and it's important to take care of them properly to ensure they last as long as possible. One way to do this is by washing them infrequently. Instead of washing them after every wear, try to wear them a few times before tossing them in the laundry. This not only saves water and energy, but it also helps preserve the color and shape of the jeans. When it is time to wash your jeans, it's important to turn them inside out prior to washing. This helps protect the outside of the jeans from fading, pilling, or any other damage that can occur during the washing process. Another important tip is to use a color preserving detergent or vinegar. Both of these options help preserve the color of the jeans, which is especially important for darker colored denim. When using vinegar, simply add a cup to your washing machine during the rinse cycle. Not only does it preserve color, but it also helps kill bacteria and eliminate odors. It's also important to wash your jeans with other garments. This helps prevent them from rubbing against each other, which can cause unnecessary wear and tear. In addition, washing jeans with other clothes also helps balance out the load and prevent the washing machine from becoming unbalanced. When it comes to the washing process, use the lowest spin cycle and temperature. This helps prevent any unnecessary wear and tear on the fabric, as well as minimizes any potential shrinkage. Overall, by following these simple tips, you can help extend the life of your jeans and keep them looking great for as long as possible."},{"prompt":"Premise: so you're doing it yourself but Based on this premise, is the hypothesis Ah, you're taking care of it yourself. true?

There are certain risk factors that make some dogs more susceptible to dehydration, such as hot and humid weather conditions, exercise, and certain health conditions like kidney disease and diabetes. If you suspect your dog is dehydrated, it's important to take them to the veterinarian as soon as possible. The vet will check their vital signs and hydration levels and may recommend intravenous fluids to help rehydrate them quickly. In addition to medical treatment, pet owners can do their part to help rehydrate their dogs at home by giving them rehydration fluids. These fluids are readily available at pet stores and can be easily mixed with water to create a hydrating and flavorful drink. Adding electrolytes can also help boost their hydration levels. If your dog is reluctant to drink on their own, you can use a syringe to give them fluids or even try offering ice cubes or a flavored frozen treat to encourage them to drink more.

The ruling stems from the case of Michael Roberston, who was arrested in a sting operation after using his phone to take 'upskirt' photos and videos on the subway. Community leaders are urging lawmakers to update the law to include 'upskirt' photos of people wearing underwear.","completion":"A Call to Update Massachusetts’ Laws on Non-consensual Photography Massachusetts is currently facing a legal loophole regarding non-consensual photography. The law states that it is only illegal to photograph a person without their permission if they are nude or partially nude. This ruling has proven to be problematic, particularly in cases of ‘upskirt’ photography. This issue came under public scrutiny after the arrest of Michael Roberston, who was caught taking ‘upskirt’ photos and videos with his phone in a subway. While the incident was recorded, Robertson’s charges did not hold up in court because Massachusetts law was not specific enough on this front. As it stands now, these types of incidents can be considered a public nuisance, but are not considered criminal offenses. Community leaders have thus urged lawmakers to update laws in the state to ensure that ‘upskirt’ photography of people wearing underwear be considered a criminal offense. These measures are necessary to protect the privacy of individuals and prevent perpetrators from getting away with unsolicited photo recordings that may be used for malicious purposes. It is essential to note that this is not an isolated issue. A survey conducted by the cybersecurity company, Kaspersky Lab, revealed that more than one-third of women in the United States have been victims of ‘upskirt’ photography. This problem is not unique to Massachusetts, and as technology progresses, its effects could only become more invasive. It is crucial that the state addresses this legal loophole as soon as possible. The public has spoken loud and clear on this matter. Authorities must take a step further in safeguarding the privacy and dignity of its residents.

The most important of these include the Classics of Confucianism, of Daoism, of Mohism, of Legalism, as well as works of military science (e.g. Sun Tzu's The Art of War) and Chinese history (e.g. Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian). Ancient Chinese literature had a heavy emphasis on historiography, with often very detailed court records.

One of the best ways to ensure your object won't come crashing down is to find a stud to anchor it to. This can be done using a stud finder or by tapping the wall until you hear a solid sound instead of a hollow one. Once you've located a stud, you'll want to pre-drill a hole at the spot where you want to hang the object. This will make it easier to install the anchor, which is an essential part of the process. Tap the anchor into the hole you drilled, making sure it's flush with the wall. Finally, you can drive the screw into the anchor, using a power drill or a screwdriver. This should be done carefully and slowly, making sure the screw doesn't become stripped or damaged in the process. With the screw securely in the anchor, you can hang your heavy object with confidence, knowing that it's not going anywhere. Overall, using heavy-duty hardware and taking the time to properly install it will ensure that your wall hangings stay put and don't cause any damage or injuries.

At the age of 35, he famously sat in meditation under a Ficus religiosa tree now called the Bodhi Tree in the town of Bodh Gaya and vowed not to rise before achieving enlightenment. After many days, he finally destroyed the fetters of his mind, thereby liberating himself from the cycle of suffering and rebirth, and arose as a fully enlightened being (Skt. samyaksaṃbuddha). Soon thereafter, he attracted a band of followers and instituted a monastic order.

Lowering the seat a little will allow your child to comfortably touch the ground with their feet. Once the seat is adjusted, you can support your child, not the bike, and encourage them to push off the ground with their feet. Be careful not to hold onto the bike too tightly, as this can make it harder for your child to balance. As your child gains speed, they will naturally start to glide. Your job is to provide gentle assistance, while allowing your child to feel like they are in control. Encourage them to look ahead and not down at their feet. This will help them to maintain their balance and focus on where they are going. Once your child has gained confidence and is comfortable gliding, it's time to introduce the pedals. Return the pedals to their proper positions and have your child start pedaling. You may need to offer some guidance at first, but with a little practice, they will be pedaling on their own.

Kenneth Branagh's performance came close to stealing this movie from Helena Bonham Carter, but their strong chemistry together made for a much more enjoyable movie. This movie brought to mind the excellent movies that Branagh made with Emma Thompson. Carter's star turn here as a disabled young women seeking to complete herself was as good a performance as I have seen from a female lead in a long time.

Griffiths and Andrea Scarantino , emphasizes the importance of external factors in the development and communication of emotion, drawing upon the situationism approach in psychology. This theory is markedly different from both cognitivist and neoJamesian theories of emotion, both of which see emotion as a purely internal process, with the environment only acting as a stimulus to the emotion. In contrast, a situationist perspective on emotion views emotion as the product of an organism investigating its environment, and observing the responses of other organisms. Emotion stimulates the evolution of social relationships, acting as a signal to mediate the behavior of other organisms. In some contexts, the expression of emotion (both voluntary and involuntary) could be seen as strategic moves in the transactions between different organisms. The situated perspective on emotion states that conceptual thought is not an inherent part of emotion, since emotion is an actionoriented form of skillful engagement with the world.

Both characters feel very alone, and the apparently less intelligent one will show to the executive the beauty of the small things in life...

Anyway, as there were some interesting scenes (the boy is sometimes quite a violent guy), and the interpretation of both actors, Daniel Auteil and Pasqal Duquenne, was very good, I decided to go on watching the movie.

Along with a plan, practicing self-control and managing stress can enhance one's overall well-being. Here are some tips: Create a Plan: Take some time to outline your goals and priorities for the next few years. Set realistic targets and create a roadmap for how to achieve them. Having a plan can provide a sense of direction and motivation. Smile: Even if you don't feel like it, force a smile. Research has shown that smiling can actually help improve mood and reduce stress levels. Plus, it's a simple way to spread positivity to those around you. Spend time/money on others: Generosity can lead to increased happiness and overall life satisfaction. Whether it's volunteering, donating to charity, or simply buying a gift for a loved one, investing in others can have a profound impact on one's sense of purpose and joy. Create obstacles for yourself: Set up deliberate barriers to help support self-control. For instance, if you're trying to save money, set up automatic transfers to a separate account that is not easily accessible. This can help mitigate impulsive spending urges. Reward successful self-control efforts: Acknowledge and celebrate when you successfully stick to your plan. Treat yourself to a favorite meal, watch an episode of your favorite TV show, or engage in another activity that brings you joy. Punish unsuccessful self-control efforts: Just as rewards can serve as positive reinforcement, penalties can be used to deter negative behavior. For instance, if you frequently hit the snooze button instead of exercising in the morning, consider instituting a small fine each time you skip your workout. Reduce stress: Finally, prioritize activities and actions that help reduce stress levels. This could be spending time in nature, engaging in physical activity, practicing mindfulness or meditation, or seeking out social support from friends and family. By incorporating these tips into your life, you can create a plan for a fulfilling future while enhancing self-control and reducing stress."},{"prompt":"The U.S. Constitution uses but does not define the phrase \`\`natural born Citizen'', and various opinions have been offered over time regarding its precise meaning.

There are different ways to prepare salmon fillets, such as grilling, baking, or pan-frying, and the specific method depends on personal preference and the type of recipe. Before cooking the salmon, it is important to remove any bones and scales that may be present. A pair of tweezers or pliers can be used to remove any small bones, while a fillet knife can be used to remove larger bones. Once the salmon is bone-free, it can be seasoned with herbs, spices, or marinades for added flavor. When prepping salmon, it is also important to discard any leftovers or trimmings. This helps to ensure that the remaining salmon is fresh and safe to eat. Leftover salmon can be refrigerated or frozen for later use in other dishes, such as salads or sandwiches. In general, it is important to handle raw salmon with care to avoid the spread of bacteria. Always wash hands thoroughly before and after handling raw fish, and use separate cutting boards and utensils for raw and cooked food items. Cook the salmon to an internal temperature of 145 degrees Fahrenheit to ensure that it is cooked thoroughly and safe to eat. In conclusion, properly preparing salmon fillets is an important step in achieving a delicious and healthy meal.

Before using a propane tank, there are a few important things to check to ensure that it is in good condition and safe to use. Firstly, make sure that the propane tank has a triangular valve. This valve is specific to propane tanks and indicates that the tank is designed for propane use. Using a tank with the wrong type of valve can lead to serious safety issues. Next, inspect the outside of the tank carefully for any damage or dents. Even the slightest damage could cause a leak which can result in a fire or explosion. If you notice any damage or dents, it is best to replace the tank rather than trying to repair it. It is also important to check the date printed on the tank. Propane tanks have a limited lifespan, and it is recommended that they be replaced after 12 years of use. If the tank you are using is older than 12 years, it is best to replace it with a new one. Lastly, locate the tare weight and the amount of propane the tank holds on the collar. The tare weight is the weight of the empty tank, and the amount of propane the tank holds will be labeled as a capacity in pounds or gallons. Knowing this information will help you to determine how much propane is left in the tank and when it needs to be refilled.

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"In 1865, the United States of America experienced the end of the Civil War, a long and bloody struggle between the northern and southern regions of the country. One of the most significant outcomes of the war was the abolition of slavery across the whole of America. For centuries, since America's founding, slavery had been an integral part of the southern economy. The reliance on human labor to work the cotton and tobacco fields had led to an extensive system of slavery, in which millions of people were bought and sold as property. As the USA evolved, a divide between the northern and southern states grew, with the former becoming increasingly industrialized and abolitionist in outlook, while the latter remained agriculturally focused and pro-slavery. In 1861, tensions between the two sides broke out into war, and a brutal conflict ensued. After four years of fighting, the Union finally prevailed, and the southern states surrendered. One of the key factors leading to victory was the Union's decision to abolish slavery. In 1863, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, declaring all slaves in Confederate territory to be instantly free. This measure proved crucial to the Union's eventual victory, as it enabled the enlistment of black soldiers into the Union army, leading to a significant increase in manpower. Following the end of the war in 1865, the 13th Amendment to the US Constitution was ratified, officially outlawing slavery and involuntary servitude across the whole of the country. This momentous achievement represented a new era in America's history, where the horrors of slavery were relegated to the past. Of course, the end of slavery did not mark the end of racism or discrimination in America, as subsequent events such as the Jim Crow laws and the civil rights movement would demonstrate. However, the abolition of slavery represents a crucial step in the struggle for equality and justice, a reminder of the dangers of hatred, division, and mistreatment of our fellow human beings."},{"prompt":"PHOTOGRAPH COLLECTING gains new stature as prices rise. Price records are being set at auctions this week. At Christie's, a folio of 21 prints from Alfred Stieglitz's Equivalents series sold for 396,000, a singlelot record. Other works also have been exceeding price estimates. In part, prices reflect development of a market structure based on such variables as the number of prints.

Another important step is to withhold food for at least 12 hours before setting the trap. This will increase the chances of the animal being hungry enough to take the bait and enter the trap.

It's important to wait and watch for the animal to enter the trap, and to avoid interfering with the trap or the animal while waiting.

Some euphorbias have leafless, rounded bodies adapted to water conservation similar to those of globular cacti, but characters such as the structure of their flowers make it clear that the two groups are not closely related. The cladistic method takes a systematic approach to characters, distinguishing between those that carry no information about shared evolutionary history – such as those evolved separately in different groups (homoplasies) or those left over from ancestors (plesiomorphies) – and derived characters, which have been passed down from innovations in a shared ancestor (apomorphies).

But Army bans display of 'distinctive religious symbols' Soldiers had found cross 'inspiring' and 'motivating'","completion":"Recently, there has been controversy surrounding the ban on the display of 'distinctive religious symbols' within NATO Camp Marmal in Afghanistan. Many soldiers in the army have been disappointed with the recent decision, as the display of these symbols had been a source of inspiration and motivation for many. One particular symbol that has been affected by this ban is the Christian cross. Many soldiers had found the cross to be a powerful reminder of their faith and a source of strength in difficult times. For them, the cross represented a symbol of hope and love, and it had helped them to endure the challenges of their deployment. However, the army's decision to ban the display of such religious symbols has left many soldiers feeling disenfranchised and unsupported. The argument behind the ban is that displaying these symbols could be seen as an endorsement of a particular religion, which goes against the principles of neutrality and inclusivity within the military. While it is important to respect the religious beliefs of all individuals and ensure that all soldiers feel valued and supported, it is also important not to take away the sources of inspiration that aid those in difficult positions. The cross, for instance, is not merely about religion but is also a symbol of courage and perseverance, which are essential qualities in a soldier's life. The issue also raises questions regarding the extent to which one's religious beliefs should be taken into consideration. In a diverse and multicultural environment, it is important to ensure that no individual is ever made to feel excluded or uncomfortable due to their beliefs. However, it is also worth bearing in mind that religious beliefs often hold a significant place in an individual's identity and can provide them with a sense of purpose and meaning. Ultimately, the decision to ban the display of religious symbols within NATO Camp Marmal in Afghanistan is a complex issue that requires thoughtful consideration. While it is essential to ensure that all individuals feel included and respected, it is equally important to recognise the importance of symbols such as the cross, which for many soldiers is a source of strength and motivation."},{"prompt":"Which is this about?

Depending on the implementation, the transmission in front of the epicyclic system may be greatly simplified, or eliminated completely.

The conflict began as a struggle for succession to the throne between two powerful factions, but it quickly escalated into a full-blown civil war that engulfed much of the country. As the war raged on, many ordinary people became disillusioned with the samurai class, which was seen as responsible for much of the violence and chaos. Some began to set up their own revolts, either against the samurai or against local lords who were seen as oppressive or corrupt. Unfortunately, it is impossible to give a precise number for how many times this happened. The Ōnin War was a decentralized conflict, with many different factions and actors operating independently of one another. Furthermore, the sources available to us today are often fragmentary and unreliable, so it is difficult to say for certain how many local revolts or uprisings occurred. Nevertheless, we can say with some certainty that the people of Japan were deeply affected by the war and that many of them took matters into their own hands. Some joined forces with Buddhist or Shinto sects that were known for their anti-authoritarian beliefs, while others simply band together in loose-knit groups to protect their families and communities. Perhaps most importantly, the Ōnin War represents a turning point in Japanese history. It marked the beginning of a long period of instability and turmoil that lasted for several decades, and it helped to set the stage for the rise of powerful warlords who would come to dominate Japanese politics and society in the centuries to come."},{"prompt":"Read this: In the 11th century, a turbulent period occurred in the history of Maritime Southeast Asia.

If you experience this sort of discomfort, it is crucial to take it seriously and seek medical attention. While chest pain could have multiple causes like muscle strain, indigestion, or anxiety, it may also indicate underlying medical conditions that require treatment. Medical experts suggest that it's essential to pay attention to other symptoms that come with chest pain. A dry cough, for instance, could be an indication of respiratory problems. Therefore, it's crucial to listen to your body and understand what it's trying to tell you. Once you've taken note of your symptoms, it's time to seek a medical diagnosis. A blood test is an excellent starting point, and it can determine if your organs are functioning correctly, if there's a sign of inflammation, or if you have an infection. An ultrasound is another diagnostic process that can help detect any abnormalities within the body's organs. This non-invasive procedure uses sound waves to create images of internal organs, and it's particularly useful when examining the heart or liver. A chest x-ray is yet another test that is necessary when experiencing chest pain. This imaging process can help identify issues like lung cancer or pneumonia, which may be complicating your pain. Finally, if none of the previous tests has provided enough information, a biopsy may be the next step. This involves a tissue sample being taken from an area in the body that is suspected to have an underlying issue. The sample is then sent to a laboratory for study. In conclusion, chest pain is an issue that you should never ignore. If you experience this symptom, pay attention to what your body is attempting to tell you. Ensure you get an accurate diagnosis through the appropriate tests to ensure that you receive the correct treatment plan. Remember, the earlier you get a diagnosis, the better the chances of recovery."},{"prompt":"Generate a short movie review that has positive sentiment.","completion":"\\"Parasite\\" is a masterpiece that tells a compelling story of class struggle with masterful direction and breathtaking cinematography.

Yuba Power Products. The American Law Institute subsequently adopted a slightly different version of the Greenman rule in Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, which was published in 1964 and was very influential throughout the United States. Outside the U.S., the rule was adopted by the European Economic Community in the Product Liability Directive of July 1985 by Australia in July 1992 and by Japan in June 1994.
