It occurs between particles or objects. It causes them to attract or repel each other. They do not even have to touch. This is unlike the typical push or pull you may be familiar with. All electric charge is based on the protons and electrons in atoms. A proton has a positive electric charge. An electron has a negative electric charge. Forces on Charged Objects Most atoms are balanced electrically. They have the same number of positive and negative charges. Therefore, the number of protons equals the number of electrons. Neutrons do not matter as they have no charge. When an object loses some electrons, it becomes positively charged. There are now more protons than electrons inside the atom. The lost electrons may remain free. Or, they may attach to another object. The new object now has more electrons than protons. It then becomes negatively charged.

Writers like Paul Morley began advocating overground brightness instead of the experimental sensibilities promoted in early years. Morley's own musical collaboration with engineer Gary Langan and programmer J. J. Jeczalik, the Art of Noise, would attempt to bring sampled and electronic sounds to the pop mainstream.

Speaking of sponsorships, it's important to remember that UFC fighters are not just skilled athletes, but also brand ambassadors. As such, they often have corporate sponsorships that help support their career. Research companies that align with your values and market yourself accordingly. However, simply being a good fighter is not enough to stand out in a pool of talented competitors. To truly make a name for yourself, you need to be unique. This could mean developing a signature move, having a distinct personality or fighting style, or having an inspiring backstory that sets you apart. Finally, consider attending a UFC tryout.

Some dogs may already be well-trained and ready to integrate into your household seamlessly, while others may require more time and effort to train.

However, generally speaking, rebellions are often led by a group or individuals who feel oppressed, marginalized or disadvantaged in some way. This can include those who are dissatisfied with political, social, or economic conditions in their country or region. In the United States, for example, the most well-known rebellion was the American Revolution which took place from 1765 to 1783. This rebellion was led by the Patriots who were a diverse group of people that included merchants, farmers, and soldiers. The Patriots believed that they were being unfairly taxed by the British government and wanted to establish their own independent country. Other American rebellions include the Whiskey Rebellion of 1791-1794, which was led by Western farmers who were protesting against a recently enacted tax on whiskey. In France, one of the most famous rebellions was the French Revolution of 1789-1799. This movement was led by various groups such as the Sans-culottes, who were working-class citizens, and intellectual revolutionaries who were inspired by Enlightenment ideas. They all wanted to overthrow the monarchy and create a more democratic society that was focused on liberty and equality. In India, Mahatma Gandhi led the nonviolent Indian independence movement against British colonial rule. Gandhi's followers were from all sectors of society, including peasants, laborers, and urban intellectuals. They protested against British oppression through acts of civil disobedience and nonviolent resistance. In recent times, the Arab Spring that began in 2010 saw rebels coming from all walks of life in the Middle East, from poor farmers to educated young professionals. They were united in their protest against authoritarian governments and desired greater democratic rights and freedoms.

The unique coloring is sure to make a statement in any room. For a reddish look, go for the marginata colorama cultivar. Its leaves are primarily green but have vibrant red edges that give the plant a bold look. This cultivar is perfect for those seeking a pop of color in their indoor garden. Finally, the marginata Tarzan cultivar is an excellent choice for those who enjoy spikier leaves. With its narrow, pointed foliage, this plant is a more dramatic take on the classic Dracaena marginata. No matter which cultivar you choose, the Dracaena marginata is a great addition to any indoor garden.

Kruidbos had informed the defense team in the George Zimmerman case that not all images and text messages retrieved from Trayvon Martin's cell phone had been given to them. This missing evidence included images of Martin blowing smoke, holding a gun, and images of marijuana. The defense team had requested a delay in the case due to this missing evidence, but their request was denied. This decision ultimately impacted the outcome of the trial, as the defense argued that crucial evidence had been withheld from them. Kruidbos's termination raises questions about the ethics and fairness of the legal system. Should evidence be withheld from the defense team, it could potentially result in a wrongful conviction. This case serves as a reminder of the importance of transparency and honesty in legal proceedings. Kruidbos has since filed a lawsuit against the state, claiming that he was retaliation for his actions in revealing the missing evidence. This lawsuit serves as a reminder of the bravery it takes for individuals to speak up against wrongdoing, even at the risk of losing their job. It also raises important questions about the importance of protecting whistleblowers and ensuring that they are not unfairly punished for doing the right thing.

Most popular application so far is within mobile phones and hearing aids. The chemical's Britishbased inventor Stephen Coulson says it could be applied to almost everything. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"A British inventor has developed a liquid repellent nano-coating technology that may revolutionize the way water is treated on surfaces. Stephen Coulson, the inventor, has demonstrated the technology's effectiveness in the most popular application, namely mobile phones and hearing aids. The coating prevents water from being absorbed onto surfaces and is said to have many other potential applications. The liquid repellent nano-coating technology developed by Coulson is the result of years of research and experimentation. The technology is a coating that can be applied to a range of surfaces, including metals, plastics, and fabrics. It works by creating a layer of nanoparticles on the surface, which repel water on contact. The most popular application so far has been in electronic devices such as mobile phones and hearing aids. These devices are particularly vulnerable to water damage, and the use of the liquid-repellent coating technology can help protect them. The coating ensures that water cannot penetrate the surface of these devices, keeping them safe from damage. However, the potential applications for this technology go far beyond electronics. Coulson believes that the coating could be applied to almost everything. The coating could be used in the construction industry to protect buildings from water damage, or in the automotive industry to prevent rainwater from sticking to cars. The liquid-repellent coating technology is still relatively new, but it is already showing great promise. The technology could have a significant impact on the way we live our lives, protecting our belongings from water damage and reducing the need for waterproofing products. In conclusion, the liquid repellent nano-coating technology developed by British inventor Stephen Coulson is a significant technological advancement that could change the way we interact with water. While the technology's most popular application so far has been in mobile phones and hearing aids, the possibilities for this technology are endless. Its potential applications could make our lives safer and more comfortable, while reducing the need for waterproofing products."},{"prompt":"Which is a good solar panel installation provider in Soledad, California CA?

The daimyo, or lords, were at the top, followed by the warriorcaste of samurai, with the farmers, artisans, and traders ranking below. In some parts of the country, particularly smaller regions, daimyo and samurai were more or less identical, since daimyo might be trained as samurai, and samurai might act as local lords. Otherwise, the largely inflexible nature of this social stratification system unleashed disruptive forces over time. Taxes on the peasantry were set at fixed amounts which did not account for inflation or other changes in monetary value. As a result, the tax revenues collected by the samurai landowners were worth less and less over time. This often led to numerous confrontations between noble but impoverished samurai and welltodo peasants, ranging from simple local disturbances to much bigger rebellions. None, however, proved compelling enough to seriously challenge the established order until the arrival of foreign powers. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply unanswerable): What effect did the way the taxes were charged have on it's revenue.","completion":"The fixed tax system, without accounting for changes in inflation or monetary value, resulted in the decreasing value of tax revenues collected by the samurai landowners over time."},{"prompt":"Sentence: Allama Iqbal International Airport is found in Punjab, Pakistan.

First, make sure your glass item is clean and dry. Wipe it down with glass cleaner and a lint-free cloth to remove any dirt or grime.

In 2006, the company was fined for not having a proper risk management plan in place. This should have served as a wake-up call for the company to ensure that their operations were safe for employees and nearby residents. However, it seems that the lessons from the past were not learned. According to reports, the company told a federal agency that there was \\"no\\" risk of a fire at their facility. This is a shocking statement, given that chemical plants and factories are known to be at risk of fires and explosions. Unfortunately, the consequences of the company's lack of safety measures were seen earlier this year when a fire broke out at the plant. The nearby school had to be evacuated, and residents in the area were warned to stay indoors. It is deeply concerning that a company would not take safety seriously and put its workers and the community at risk. The fact that the plant was able to operate despite safety violations and without implementing proper safety measures is an indication of a larger problem with oversight and regulation. The owner of West Fertilizer Co., Donald Adair, stated that he was stunned by the fire. While it is clear that no one wants to see a tragedy play out before their eyes, it is incumbent upon business owners to take proactive steps to ensure that their operations are safe. This situation should serve as a reminder that safety regulations and risk management plans are in place for a reason. Companies should not take shortcuts or disregard the safety of their workers and the community. In the end, it is not only a moral responsibility but a legal one as well.

Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has expressed her worries about the situation, stating that the Russian involvement could prolong the conflict and further harm civilians caught in the crossfire. A recent development in the situation is the claim by a top United Nations official that Syria is now in a state of civil war. The violence continues to claim lives, with 60 people reported killed on Tuesday by an opposition group. Meanwhile, Syrian authorities have reported 36 \\"martyrs\\" buried. The conflict is taking a toll on innocent civilians, including children, who are being subjected to torture by government forces. The United Nations has released a report detailing cases where children have been tortured in custody because their relatives are suspected of supporting the opposition. The situation in Syria remains dire, and it is crucial that world leaders take action to protect civilians and bring an end to the conflict. It is important that all parties involved work towards a diplomatic solution, rather than continuing to escalate the conflict with weapons and violence.

They live together in large wellorganized colonies that may be so tightly integrated and genetically similar that the colonies of some species are sometimes considered superorganisms. It is sometimes argued that the various species of honey bee are the only invertebrates (and indeed one of the few nonhuman groups) to have evolved a system of abstract symbolic communication where a behavior is used to represent and convey specific information about something in the environment. In this communication system, called dance language, the angle at which a bee dances represents a direction relative to the sun, and the length of the dance represents the distance to be flown.:309–311 Though perhaps not as advanced as honey bees, bumblebees also potentially have some social communication behaviors.

The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow.

This has led in part to a focus on identifying and investigating the effect of temporal events (as opposed to static things) within organizations through an “organization studies” discourse that accommodates a variety of 'weak' and 'strong' process perspectives from a number of philosophers. One of the leading figures having an explicitly Whiteheadian and panexperientialist stance towards management is Mark Dibben, who works in what he calls applied process thought to articulate a philosophy of management and business administration as part of a wider examination of the social sciences through the lens of process metaphysics. For Dibben, this allows a comprehensive exploration of life as perpetually active experiencing, as opposed to occasional – and thoroughly passive – happening. Dibben has published two books on applied process thought, Applied Process Thought I: Initial Explorations in Theory and Research (2008), and Applied Process Thought II: Following a Trail Ablaze (2009), as well as other papers in this vein in the fields of philosophy of management and business ethics.

He had all of his belongings in his car when he accidentally crossed the border into Mexico. He alerted the Mexican border guards, but they did not allow him to turn around.

Jill is relying on her faith to get her through this difficult time. She has started a petition on the White House website, which has garnered over 130,000 signatures, asking for her son's release. She has also spoken out to various media outlets to raise awareness about her son's plight. The case has drawn the attention of politicians such as Rep. Duncan Hunter of California, who has called on the Mexican government to release Andrew. Hunter has even offered to switch places with Andrew if it would result in his release.

Obama wanted clarification on how and when U.S. troops would turn over responsibility to Afghan security forces. The United States currently has approximately 8,400 troops stationed in Afghanistan. The additional troops from NATO Allies will provide much-needed support in the region, particularly as the Taliban continues to regain control of parts of the country. The announcement of the troop increase is expected to come as a relief to Afghan officials, who have been calling for more support from the international community. Despite the increasing violence in Afghanistan, Obama has been hesitant to commit more troops to the region, citing the need for a long-term political solution to the conflict.

A multimeter is a handheld device for measuring electrical current, resistance, or voltage. Multimeters are available in either digital or analog models, and can sport a variety of different features. OPTIONS: The important consideration when choosing a meter to measure dc offset is the lowest available voltage range. Because dc offset readings will be quite small (usually under 100 mv), you need a meter with a small range (sensitivity) so that the readings will register correctly. Multimeters tend to be very handoperated and can be purchased at most hardware stores, supermarkets, and electronics supply stores. Inflate the multimeter to determine the current you are calculating. Handheld multimeters generate a voltage range of at least. 0 to 1.8 ppm per volt. Simply purchase a multimeter that's actually an meter, and read the manufacturer's instructions about manufacturing and how to calibrate it.

There have been no significant historically recorded earthquakes in Houston, but researchers do not discount the possibility of such quakes having occurred in the deeper past, nor occurring in the future. Land in some areas southeast of Houston is sinking because water has been pumped out of the ground for many years. It may be associated with slip along the faults; however, the slippage is slow and not considered an earthquake, where stationary faults must slip suddenly enough to create seismic waves. These faults also tend to move at a smooth rate in what is termed fault creep, which further reduces the risk of an earthquake.

The country has a rich and diverse history, and its population is composed of various ethnic and religious groups. However, the majority of the people in Albania are either Christians or Muslims. Historically, Albania was a predominantly Muslim country, with approximately 70% of the population identifying as Muslim in the early 20th century. However, during the communist period, religion was heavily suppressed, and many Albanians became atheists. As a result, the number of Muslims in Albania decreased significantly. According to recent estimates, approximately 60% of the population in Albania identifies as Muslim, while 17% identifies as Catholic and 6% identifies as Orthodox Christian. The remaining 17% of the population identifies as either atheist or follows different religious traditions. Therefore, the answer to the question of whether there are more Christians or Muslims in Albania is that there are more Muslims. However, it is important to note that Albania is a secular country, and the government guarantees freedom of religion for all its citizens. Albanians are known for their religious tolerance and respect for diversity, and while there have been tensions between different religious groups in the past, the country is generally peaceful and harmonious. In conclusion, while Albania is a predominantly Muslim country, it is also home to significant Christian and other religious communities. The country's diverse religious landscape is a reflection of its complex history and culture, and its people continue to embrace religious diversity and tolerance as a fundamental value."},{"prompt":"What would be an example of an negative review?","completion":"Example of negative review: \\"I had a terrible experience at this restaurant.

One of the most important is to get to know the product inside and out. This means understanding its features, benefits, and applications, as well as any potential challenges or limitations. By doing so, you'll be better equipped to answer questions, address concerns, and help customers make informed decisions. Another important step is to reference your customer data database. This can be invaluable in helping you understand who your customers are, what they need, and how you can best serve them. By analyzing data such as purchase history, demographics, and preferences, you can tailor your approach to each individual customer, making them feel valued and heard. Speaking clearly is also essential. Clear communication helps ensure that the customer understands the product and its benefits, as well as any potential drawbacks. This can help build trust and confidence, making customers more likely to purchase the product and recommend it to others. Adhering to a blueprint script can also be helpful. This provides a consistent framework for the conversation, allowing you to cover all the key points and ensure that you don't miss any important details. It can also be useful for training new employees or ensuring that all team members are on the same page. Sprinkling open-ended questions into the conversation is another effective strategy. These types of questions encourage customers to share their thoughts, opinions, and concerns, helping you understand what they need and how you can best address their needs. Finally, giving directions with signposting can help keep the conversation focused and on track. This means providing clear instructions and guidance on how to proceed, as well as using visual or auditory cues to indicate changes in direction or topic. In conclusion, these strategies can help you sell products more effectively and build stronger relationships with your customers. By getting to know the product, referencing your customer data database, speaking clearly, adhering to a blueprint script, sprinkling open-ended questions into the conversation, and giving directions with signposting, you can create a positive and successful sales experience for both you and your customers."},{"prompt":"ere are some concepts: accent, bedroom, wall What is a sentence about these concepts?","completion":"I painted an accent wall in my bedroom."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: when did the drinking age turn to 21 in nj?","completion":"The drinking age turned to 21 in NJ in 1983."},{"prompt":"ere is a premise: A father comforts her daughter after other family members had taken off for an event in Los Angele's.

Its metaphysics includes the concept of māyā and ātman. Māyā connotes that which exists, but is constantly changing and thus is spiritually unreal. The empirical reality is considered as always changing and therefore transitory, incomplete, misleading and not what it appears to be.

They hold that dualities and misunderstanding of māyā as the spiritual reality that matters is caused by ignorance, and are the cause of sorrow, suffering.

The mother-of-two was accused of leaving her potential suitors humiliated, miserable, and deep in debt. The judge presiding over the case described her actions as deceitful and said that her victims had suffered significantly due to her dishonesty. Despite the severity of the crime, Fatima escaped jail time and was given only a 12-month suspended sentence. Her husband, Raja Haider Ali, 45, was also implicated in the case. He was accused of threatening those who asked for their money back, claiming that he had already murdered 20 people in Pakistan. The court heard how Ali had used intimidation tactics to keep the men quiet and to prevent them from taking legal action against his wife. The case has highlighted the scourge of fraud and deception in modern-day relationships. The rise of online dating and social media platforms has made it easier for individuals to create fake identities and to exploit vulnerable people for financial gain. It is not uncommon for people to pretend to be someone they are not, using fake names, photographs, and even entire backstories to trick others into falling for them. The case of Sidra Fatima is a stark reminder of the dangers of online dating and the importance of being vigilant when entering into relationships.

However, the plan has received criticism from some quarters, including the Liberal Democrats and certain civil servants.

Supporters of the plan argue that the creation of these free schools will help to drive up educational standards across the country, providing more choice and diversity for students and their families. However, critics argue that this approach takes funding away from existing schools, and that it may not be the best way to address the systemic issues faced by the education system. They also point out that many free schools have struggled to attract enough students or to maintain consistent academic performance. Ultimately, the success of this plan will depend on a number of factors, including the quality of the schools established, the extent to which they are able to attract talented teachers and support staff, and the willingness of local communities to embrace them.

She was unaware she was running up a massive phone bill which came out of her father's bank account. Orange said the teenager ran up the charges by using 'data roaming' Data roaming is a service which allows users to use the Internet abroad. Her mother Kate has accused the phone company of 'extortion'","completion":"Casey Snook, a 14-year old teenager, recently uploaded photos on Facebook of her trip to New York, unaware that the activity would leave her father with a massive phone bill charge. According to Orange, the teenager ran up the charges by using data roaming. Data roaming is a service which enables users to use the Internet abroad without using their home data plan. Unfortunately, the service has the downside of expensive roaming fees which Casey's father was not aware of. As a result of this incident, Casey's mother, Kate, has accused the phone company of extortion. Although Casey may not have been aware of the high fees of data roaming, Orange is now in the hot seat for not properly communicating with customers about the potential cost implications of such a service. It is essential that telecommunication providers clearly communicate any associated expenses of using their services abroad. Customers should be provided with a clear understanding of the cost structure, charges, mileage for billing, and how to limit the overall expenses. There are several ways that customers can potentially avoid expensive phone bills while traveling overseas. One is to purchase a pre-paid international data plan before the trip. This plan will provide a reasonable amount of data and text messages, without the worry of going beyond limits. Another is to use wireless Internet as much as possible. Public Wi-Fi is relatively cheap, and its use is easy to monitor. Moreover, it is essential to check the roaming charges of a specific country before leaving home and consider turning off some applications that we don’t require when traveling but which might accrue data usage unknowingly. In conclusion, Casey Snook's situation is a cautionary tale to those who take their phones abroad. Orange, like other phone companies, should communicate the risks and cost implications of their international services. In the end, the solution lies in the hands of the customers. Checking the cost structure of phone plans and options for overseas travel is crucial. While it's convenient to stay connected while travelling, it's important to monitor our usage and be vigilant about the costs that come with such services."},{"prompt":"Attributes: name = The Golden Curry, food = Fast food, familyFriendly = no.

One way to achieve this is to include lean protein at every meal. This macronutrient not only supports weight loss, but also helps build and repair muscles. Another key factor in a healthy diet is incorporating a variety of fruits and vegetables. These foods are packed with essential vitamins and minerals, as well as fiber to keep you feeling full and satisfied. Building your meals and snacks around these nutrient-dense options can help keep you on track and prevent overeating. When it comes to carbohydrates, it's important to choose wisely. 100% whole grains are a great option, as they provide important nutrients and fiber. However, it's best to avoid refined or processed grains, which can cause blood sugar spikes and leave you feeling hungry soon after eating. Hydration is also crucial for weight loss. Not only does water help flush out toxins and support bodily functions, but it can also help manage hunger. Sometimes when we feel hungry, we are actually just thirsty. Drinking plenty of water throughout the day can help control cravings and prevent overeating. Lastly, it's important to monitor your caloric intake. Cutting 500-750 calories per day can result in safe and sustainable weight loss. By counting your calories and being mindful of portion sizes, you can be sure you are staying within your daily goal. In conclusion, a healthy and balanced diet is essential for successful weight loss.

The major three providers of servers at the time were IBM, Hewlett Packard, and Compaq, many of which were based on proprietary technology, such as IBM's Power4 microprocessors or various proprietary versions of the Unix operating system. Dell's new PowerEdge servers did not require a major investment in proprietary technologies, as they ran Microsoft Windows NT on Intel chips, and could be built cheaper than its competitors. Consequently, Dell's enterprise revenues, almost nonexistent in 1994, accounted for 13 percent of the company's total intake by 1998. Three years later, Dell passed Compaq as the top provider of Intelbased servers, with 31 percent of the market. Dell's first acquisition occurred in 1999 with the purchase of ConvergeNet Technologies for 332 million, after Dell had failed to develop an enterprise storage system inhouse; ConvergeNet's elegant but complex technology did not fit in with Dell's commodityproducer business model, forcing Dell to write down the entire value of the acquisition.

However, in the Western thought, it is generally supposed that it was a specific area peculiar merely to the great philosophers of Islam: alKindi (Alkindus), alFarabi (Abunaser), İbn Sina (Avicenna), Ibn Bajjah (Avempace), Ibn Rushd (Averroes), and Ibn Khaldun. The political conceptions of Islam such as kudrah (power), sultan, ummah, cemaa (obligation)and even the core terms of the Qur'an—i.e., ibadah (worship), din (religion), rab (master) and ilah (deity)—is taken as the basis of an analysis. Hence, not only the ideas of the Muslim political philosophers but also many other jurists and ulama posed political ideas and theories. For example, the ideas of the Khawarij in the very early years of Islamic history on Khilafa and Ummah, or that of Shia Islam on the concept of Imamah are considered proofs of political thought. The clashes between the Ehli Sunna and Shia in the 7th and 8th centuries had a genuine political character.

Park officials quickly moved to address the situation, bringing in staff members to assess the situation and ensure the safety of both the bird and the guests.

She pleaded not guilty in court today, stating that the crash was due to a partial seizure. While she admitted to driving erratically, she claimed that she had no control over her actions. Despite the circumstances, tests showed that there were no drugs or alcohol in her system at the time of the incident. This revelation supports her claim that it was a medical issue that caused the crash. Unfortunately, this incident comes only two months after the suicide of her best friend and sister-in-law, Mary. The combination of grief and a possible medical issue could have contributed to the events that led to her arrest.

His performance has been impressive so far, winning two stages and wearing the yellow jersey for several days. However, his success has been marred by controversy over his association with former doper Alexandre Vinokourov. Vinokourov, a former professional cyclist from Kazakhstan, was banned for two years in 2007 after testing positive for blood doping in the Tour de France. Despite his past, he now serves as Nibali's team manager on the Astana squad. This has led to criticism from some in the cycling community, who believe that Nibali should distance himself from Vinokourov and his tainted reputation. However, Nibali has defended his decision to work with Vinokourov. In a recent interview with Cycling News, he stated that \\"Vinokourov is a great professional who has done a lot for cycling. He's been through a lot and he's paid his dues.\\" Nibali went on to say that he trusts Vinokourov and values his insights and experience as a former rider. This is not the first time that Nibali has had to address questions about doping in his sport. As a professional cyclist, he has seen many of his colleagues face bans and scrutiny over doping allegations. Nibali has always maintained that he is a clean rider and that he believes in fair play and integrity in cycling. Despite the controversy, Nibali has continued to focus on his performance in the Tour de France. His strong showing in the early stages of the race has put him in a commanding position, and many believe that he has a good chance of winning this year's race.
