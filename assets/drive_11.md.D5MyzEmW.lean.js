The precise amount of time it takes depends on size: larger beans require a longer cooking time than smaller beans do. It is important that lima beans not be overcooked since overcooking robs beans of many of their nutrients. Undercooking should also be avoided, since undercooked beans cannot be completely digested. If the statements above are true, they most strongly support which one of the following? A: Large lima beans, even when fully cooked, are more difficult to digest than small lima beans. B: Lima beans that are added to the pot together should be as close to the same size as possible if they are to yield their full nutritional value. C: The nutrients that are lost when lima beans are overcooked are the same as those that the body fails to assimilate when lima beans are not completely digested.

Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the climatologist's argument? A: Global warming will probably cause a substantial increase in the average amount of annual precipitation in the Rocky Mountains over the coming century. B: On average, in the regions of the world with the mildest winters, there is more spring flooding and less storable water than in regions of the world with much colder winters. C: The larger a mountain snowpack is, the greater the amount of spring flooding it is likely to be responsible for producing. D: In other mountainous regions after relatively mild winters, the melting of snowpacks has led to greater spring flooding and less storable water, on average, than in those mountainous regions after colder winters.

In the winter, ECC can be heated by passing an electric current through it, thereby preventing ice buildup. The cost of the electricity needed is substantially lower than the cost of the deicing salt we currently use. Taxpayer: But construction costs for ECC are much higher than for standard concrete, so your proposal is probably not justifiable on economic grounds. Which of the following, if true, could best be used to support the highway official's proposal in the face of the taxpayer's objection? A: The use of deicing salt causes corrosion of the reinforcing steel in concrete bridge decks and damage to the concrete itself, thereby considerably shortening the useful life of concrete bridges. B: Aside from its potential use for deicing bridges, ECC might also be an effective means of keeping other concrete structures such as parking garages and airport runways ice free. C: In weather conditions conducive to icing, ice generally forms on the concrete surfaces of bridges well before it forms on parts of the roadway that go over solid ground.

Since the board' s primary mission is to safeguard the economic health of the corporation rather than to make its executives rich, this way of setting executives' salaries is expected to prevent excessively large salaries. But, clearly, this expectation is based on poor reasoning. After all, most members of a corporation' s board are themselves executives of some corporation and can expect to benefit from setting generous benchmarks for executives' salaries. The point made by the author is that the most common way of setting executives' salaries might not keep those salaries in bounds because A: many board members might let their self interest as executives interfere with properly discharging their role, as board members, in setting executives' salaries B: most corporate executives, thanks to their generous salaries, are not financially dependent on money earned as board members C: many board members who set executives' salaries unreasonably high do so because they happen to be on the board of a corporation of which they expect later to become executives D: many board members are remunerated generously and wish to protect this source of income by pleasing the executives to whom they owe their appointments on the board Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"A"},{"prompt":"At Law Practice, Inc. , last year the average annual salary for attorneys was 75, 000, while the average salary for paralegals was 50, 000.

The conveyer belts currently are composed vulcanized rubber around a cotton web base, but the factory owners are investigating new plastic polymer design. For any given size belt, the costs for belts of the two compositions are comparable. Compared to the current rubber/cotton belts, the plastic polymer belts are lighter and easier to move, so operating the conveyor belts made of plastic polymer would consume less electric energy. A change from rubber/cotton belts to plastic polymer belts would require minor modification to some of the drive cylinders of the conveyor belts, but the costs of these changes are negligible. Which of the following would it be most useful to know in determining whether switching to the plastic polymer conveyor belts would be likely to help minimize the factory's cost related to its conveyor belt system? A: Whether other mechanized factories with comparable number of conveyor belts in their systems have switched from rubber/cotton to plastic polymer conveyor belts.

This fact shows not only that these neurotoxins cause this type of brain damage, but also that the brain damage itself causes Parkinson' s disease. Thus brain scans can be used to determine who is likely to develop Parkinson' s disease. The argument contains which one of the following reasoning errors? A: It overestimates the importance of early diagnosis in determining appropriate treatments for people suffering from Parkinson's disease. B: It neglects to specify how the information provided by brain scans could be used either in treating Parkinson's disease or in monitoring the progression of the disease. C: It assumes that people would want to know as early as possible whether they were likely to develop Parkinson's disease. D: It mistakes a correlation between the type of brain damage described and Parkinson's disease for a causal relation between the two.

So, since it is clear that art is often shocking, we should not hesitate to use public funds to support works of art that many people find shocking. Which one of the following is an assumption that the art historian's argument requires in order for its conclusion to be properly drawn? A: Art used to be more shocking than it currently is. B: Most art is shocking. C: Public funds should support art. D: Anything that shocks is art.

This audience, however loyal, did not generate enough advertising revenue for us to pay our bills, so if we appeal to them alone, our station risks going out of business. We should not take that risk. We should, ttherefore, devote some airtime to other, more popular genres of music. Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its pattern of reasoning to that used by the radio producer? A: We should either buy blinds for the windows or make fulllength curtains. Blinds would be very expensive to purchase. Thus, if cost is our greatest concern, we should make curtains. B: We should either make curtains for the windows or buy blinds. Since the windows are not standard sizes, if we buy blinds we will have to special order them. Since we do not have time to wait for special orders, we should make the curtains. C: For the living room windows, we can make curtains or valances or both. We want to have privacy; and while curtains provide privacy, valances do not. So we should make curtains but not valances. D: We should either buy blinds or make curtains for the windows. If we buy blinds but do not make valances, the windows will look bare. We should not have bare windows. So if we do not make the curtains, we should make the valances.

They note that such hiring has been on the rise in recent years. Which of the following would, if true, contribute most to defeating the training experts' objection to the firms' strategy? A: Research shows that workers whose training is wholly or partially subsidized by their employer tend to get at least as much training as do workers who pay for all their own training. B: In many industries, employees who take continuingeducation courses are more competitive in the job market. C: More and more educational and training institutions are offering reduced tuition fees to firms that subsidize worker training.

Not coincidentally, the earth' s ozone layer has been continuously depleted throughout the last 50 years. Atmospheric ozone blocks UVB, a type of ultraviolet radiation that is continuously produced by the sun, and which can damage genes. Because amphibians lack hair, hide, or feathers to shield them, they are particularly vulnerable to UVB radiation. In addition, their gelatinous eggs lack the protection of leathery or hard shells. Thus, the primary cause of the declining amphibian population is the depletion of the ozone layer. Each of the following, if true, would strengthen the argument EXCEPT: A: Of the various types of radiation blocked by atmospheric ozone, UVB is the only type that can damage genes. B: Amphibian populations are declining far more rapidly than are the populations of nonamphibian species whose tissues and eggs have more natural protection from UVB.

This prospect is troubling because when a subcompact and a fullsize car collide, the people in the subcompact are more likely to be seriously injured than if theirs had also been a fullsize car. The new fuelefficiency standards should ttherefore be opposed. Leggett: But whenever any two cars collide, it is more likely that someone will be seriously injured if one of the cars is a fullsize car than if neither car is fullsize. So the new fuelefficiency standards should be supported precisely because they discourage the manufacture of fullsize cars. McBride's and Leggett's statements commit them to disagreeing about the truth of which one of the following? A: Fuel conservation is less important than safety in case of a collision. B: The manufacture of fullsize cars should be discouraged. C: The new fuelefficiency standards will encourage automobile manufacturers to build more subcompact cars.

One kind of costplus contract stipulates the contractor' s profit as a fixed percentage of the contractor' s costs; the other kind stipulates a fixed amount of profit over and above costs. Under the first kind of contract, higher costs yield higher profits for the contractor, so this is where one might expect final costs in excess of original cost estimates to be more common. Paradoxically, such cost overruns are actually more common if the contract is of the fixedprofit kind. Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent paradox in the situation described above? A: On longterm contracts, cost projections take future inflation into account, but since the figures used are provided by the government, they are usually underestimates. B: Clients billed under a costplus contract are free to review individual billings in order to uncover wasteful expenditures, but they do so only when the contractor's profit varies with cost. C: On any sizable construction project, the contractor bills the client monthly or quarterly, so any tendency for original cost estimates to be exceeded can be detected early. D: The practice of submitting deliberately exaggerated cost estimates is most common in the case of fixedprofit contracts, because it makes the profit, as a percentage of estimated cost, appear modest.

Scientists think the skeleton is about 3. 2 million years old. For six years, Lucy' s remains were part of an exhibition called Lucy' s Legacy: The Hidden Treasures of Ethiopia. However, there was much opposition to the exhibition for fear that Lucy' s fossils would be damaged. It' s a good thing that they started using casts instead; the preservation of these fossils should be the number one concern of excavators and scientists. Which of the following would be used in opposition to the passage? A: Lucy's fossils, if they are kept in exhibition for too long, are certainly at risk for damage. Even if you can't see it with the naked eye, the constant handling of fossils will cause wear and tear that time could never recover. B: Some scientists think that Lucy died from falling out of a tree, although they are not sure. There is also a tooth mark on top of a left pubic bone. What's even more curious is Lucy's age. Although she was considered fully mature, Lucy only lived for about twelve years. C: The exhibition of Lucy is an important step in raising an awareness of where humans originated and the studies thereof. Keeping the fossils isolated from the public will certainly preserve the remains; however, we might risk the deterrence of public knowledge.

These same rats exhibited heightened blood levels of corticosteroids, chemicals secreted by the adrenal glands. Since corticosteroids can interfere with immunesystem activity, scientists hypothesized that the way morphine reduces immune responses in rats is by stimulating the adrenal glands to secrete additional corticosteroids into the bloodstream. Which of the following experiments would yield the most useful results for evaluating the scientists' hypothesis? A: Testing the level of immunesystem activity of rats, removing their adrenal glands, and then testing the rats' immunesystem activity levels again B: Injecting rats with corticosteroids and then observing how many of the rats contracted infections C: Injecting morphine into rats that already have heightened blood levels of corticosteroids and then observing their new blood levels of corticosteroids D: Removing the adrenal glands of rats, injecting the rats with morphine, and then testing the level of the rats' immunesystem responses Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"D"},{"prompt":"their native habitat, amaryllis plants go dormant when the soil in which they are growing dries out during the dry season.

Postmodern architecture is dramatic, primarily because of its creative use both of materials and of the surrounding environment. An architectural style that combines elements of both classical Roman and postmodern architecture would ttherefore be both beautiful and dramatic. The reasoning in the argument is flawed in that it A: neglects to consider that an architectural style combining elements of two other architectural styles may lack certain qualities of one or both of those styles B: fails to justify its presumption that because postmodern architecture is dramatic, that is its most salient feature C: presumes, without providing justification, that for an architectural style to have certain qualities, its components must have those qualities D: ignores the possibility that there are other architectural styles whose defining qualities include both drama and beauty Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"A"},{"prompt":"When a city experiences a sharp decline in population, the city' s tax revenues, which pay for such city services as police protection and maintenance of water lines, also decrease. The area to be policed and the number and length of the water lines to be maintained, however, do not decrease. Attempting to make up the tax revenue lost by raising tax rates is not feasible, since higher tax rates would cause even more residents to leave. The information given most strongly supports which of the following general claims? A: If a city's tax rates are held stable over a period of time, neither the population nor the levels of city services provided will tend to decline over that period. B: A city that is losing residents because tax rates are perceived as too high by those residents can reverse this population trend by bringing its tax rates down to a more moderate level. C: If, in a city with sharply declining population, police protection and water line maintenance do not deteriorate, some other service previously provided by the city will deteriorate or be eliminated. D: A city that suffers revenue losses because of a sharp decline in population can make up some of the lost tax revenue by raising tax rates, provided the city's tax rates are low in relation to those of other cities.

After all, the reasoning goes, only a moral or spiritual motive could persuade people to forgo readily available sources of nutrients. But the species whose consumption is prohibited are usually essential elements of ecosystems containing other species that are used as food. The preservation of the prohibited species thus tends to help preserve the other species. Ttherefore, such prohibitions do indeed have an economic motivation. The reasoning in the anthropologist's argument is flawed because the argument A: takes for granted that people could have a reason for adopting a certain policy and nevertheless not realize what that reason is B: uses the key term prohibition in two different senses C: infers, merely from the claim that a practice has a certain desirable consequence, that this consequence must provide a motivation for the practice D: infers, merely from the claim that a certain cultural phenomenon has no economic explanation, that the explanation of this phenomenon must be spiritual or moral Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"C"},{"prompt":"Any health care plan that does not cover comprehensive annual checkups is risking the lives of its members, who are unlikely to obtain care that is not covered by their health care plans, and who may have conditions that, if not detected early, are more likely to become fatal.

But this practice may hurt more farmers in developing nations than it helps. By raising average prices for coffee, it encourages more coffee to be produced than consumers want to buy. This lowers prices for nonfairtrade coffee and thus lowers profits for nonfairtrade coffee farmers. To evaluate the strength of the economist's argument, it would be most helpful to know which of the following? A: Whether many coffee farmers in developing nations also derive income from other kinds of farming B: What proportion of coffee farmers in developing nations produce fairtrade coffee C: Whether consumers should pay extra for fairtrade coffee if doing so lowers profits for nonfairtrade coffee farmers D: Whether there is a way of alleviating the impact of the increased average prices for coffee on nonfairtrade coffee farmers' profits Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"B"},{"prompt":"Toddlers are not being malicious when they bite people.

This creates a problem for small retailers. If they try to retain their customers by lowering prices to match those of large discount chains, the result is a lower profit margin. But small retailers can retain their customer base without lowering prices if they offer exceptional service. Hence, small retailers that are forced to compete with large discount chains must offer exceptional service in order to retain their level of profitability. The reasoning is flawed because it fails to take into account the possibility that A: not all small retailers are forced to compete with large discount chains B: exceptional service is not the only reason customers prefer small retail stores C: not all large discount chains do in fact make a profit D: small retailers are often motivated by things other than the desire for profit Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"B"},{"prompt":"is virtually certain that the government contract for building the new highway will be awarded to either Phoenix Contracting or Cartwright Company.

This is because there are then fewer residents paying to maintain an infrastructure that was designed to support more people. Rising property taxes, in turn, drive more residents away, compounding the problem. Since the city of Stonebridge is starting to lose population, the city government should ttherefore refrain from raising property taxes. Which of the following, if true, would most weaken the urban planner's argument? A: Demographers project that the population of a region that includes Stonebridge will start to increase substantially within the next several years. B: Stonebridge at present benefits from grants provided by the national government to help maintain certain parts of its infrastructure. C: If Stonebridge does not raise taxes on its residents to maintain its infrastructure, the city will become much less attractive to live in as that infrastructure decays. D: If there is a small increase in property taxes in Stonebridge and a slightly larger proportion of total revenue than at present is allocated to infrastructure maintenance, the funding will be adequate for that purpose.

Once a person has been infected by a bacterium, the person' s immune system subsequently recognizes certain proteins present in that bacterium and attacks the bacterium. This recognition also takes place in the test and results in a skin irritation at the injection site. Hence the physicians who designed the test reasoned that anyone who reacts in this manner to an injection with the tuberculosis proteins has been infected with tuberculosis. Which one of the following is an assumption on which the physicians' reasoning depends? A: The ability of the proteins present in the tuberculosis bacterium to trigger the skin irritation is exclusive to that bacterium. B: All of the proteins present in diseasecausing bacteria can be recognized by the body's immune system. C: Localized skin irritations are a characteristic symptom of tuberculosis in most people. D: Some people who have been injected with proteins extracted from the tuberculosis bacterium will contract tuberculosis as a result of the injection.

However, European soil scientists have found that in forests saturated with sulfate and nitrate, trees begin to die when the nitrogen deposited exceeds the amount of nitrogen absorbed by the forest system. Since this finding is likely to apply to forests everywhere, large areas of eastern forests of North America are, undoubtedly, already being affected adversely. Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage? A: Contrary to the report cited, the nitrogen pollution now in the air is more likely to cause trees to die in eastern forests than to benefit them. B: The implication of the report cited is that the amount of nitrogen reaching eastern forests by way of polluted air is approximately what those forests need for optimal growth.

A genuinely autonomous discipline has a domain of inquiry all its own. Lucy: Nonsense. You' ve always acknowledged that philosophy is a genuinely autonomous discipline and that, like most people, you think of philosophy as addressing issues also addressed by the disciplines of linguistics, mathematics, and psychology. A field of study is a genuinely autonomous discipline by virtue of its having a unique methodology rather than by virtue of its addressing issues that no other field of study addresses. Lucy responds to Mario by A: establishing that Mario is not a philosopher B: questioning Mario's expertise in cognitive science C: showing that some of Mario's beliefs are not compatible with the principle on which he bases his conclusion D: demonstrating that Mario confuses the notion of a field of study with that of a genuinely autonomous discipline Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"C"},{"prompt":"Because of the threat of medical malpractice suits, many physicians are subjecting their patients to unnecessary medical testing. Physicians want to be able to explain their actions if anything goes wrong, and they want to be able to show that they tried everything to properly diagnose and treat an ailment. It is difficult for physicians to judge exactly how thorough they need to be in order to avoid potential liability. It is generally wise, ttherefore, for patients to avoid going to a physician unless the patients are very sick. Which one of the following, if true, would most seriously weaken the argument in the passage? A: Many diseases, if they are not caught early, can cause death. B: Under pressure from the medical malpractice insurers, many doctors have raised their fees. C: Most insurance companies subsidize the additional expense associated with unnecessary medical tests.

But since a person who has been forced to do something has not really volunteered and since the habit of volunteering cannot be said to have been fostered in a person who has not yet volunteered for anything, there is no way this policy can succeed by itself. Paul: I disagree. Some students forced to perform community service have enjoyed it so much that they subsequently actually volunteer to do something similar. In such cases, the policy can clearly be said to have fostered a habit of volunteering. Paul responds to Sarah's argument using which one of the following argumentative techniques? A: He introduces considerations that call into question one of Sarah's assumptions. B: He argues that Sarah's conception of what it means to volunteer excludes certain activities that ought to be considered instances of volunteering.

Such life could not have evolved here in the 0. 3 billion years following the meteorite bombardments, they claim. There is good reason to regard their hypothesis as false, however, for they merely offer empirical arguments against the view that life evolved on Earth; neither they nor anyone else has provided positive support for the extraterrestrialspore theory of the origin of terrestrial life. The reasoning in the astronomer's argument is flawed because the argument A: attempts to derive a conclusion from premises that contradict it B: concludes, simply because there is no evidence in favor of a hypothesis, that there is evidence against that hypothesis C: grants the truth of claims that are made by the advocates of the hypothesis but that do nothing to strengthen the astronomer's own argument D: reasons that a hypothesis is false simply because there is another hypothesis that is equally likely to be true Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"B"},{"prompt":"City leader: If our city adopts the new tourism plan, the amount of money that tourists spend here annually will increase by at least 2 billion, creating as many jobs as a new automobile manufacturing plant would.

The main purpose of this social grooming is the maintenance of social cohesion. Furthermore, group size among primates tends to increase proportionally with the size of the neocortex, the seat of higher thought in the brain. Extrapolating upon the relationship between group size and neocortex size, we can infer that early human groups were quite large. But unexpectedly, there is strong evidence that, apart from parents grooming their children, these humans spent virtually no time grooming one another. Which one of the following, if true, would do most to resolve the apparent discrepancy described above? A: Many types of primates other than humans have fairly large neocortex regions and display frequent social grooming. B: Early humans were not as extensively covered with hair as are other primates, and consequently they had less need for social grooming.

English state records show that a spy who foiled at least two assassination plots against Queen Elizabeth of England was in place in the French embassy in London at that time. Since the spy is identified in confidential English state documents only as the only clergyman working at the French embassy at that time, Bruno must have been the spy: Bruno had been ordained a member of the clergy long before he started work at the French embassy. Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the force of the evidence advanced in the argument? A: During Bruno's tenure in the French embassy, a high degree of tension and an atmosphere of mutual suspicion prevailed between France and England. B: Long before his employment at the embassy, Bruno had been excommunicated from his church and thereafter neither dressed nor functioned as a member of the clergy. C: The French ambassador at the time was a man who trusted Bruno implicitly, often defending him from the criticisms of others on the embassy staff. D: During the Renaissance, welleducated members of the clergy often served in nonclerical roles as tutors, secretaries, and personal assistants to wealthy aristocrats. Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"B"},{"prompt":"Large national budget deficits do not cause large trade deficits. If they did, countries with the largest budget deficits would also have the largest trade deficits. In fact, when deficit figures are adjusted so that different countries are reliably comparable to each other, there is no such correlation. If the statements above are all true, which of the following can properly be inferred on the basis of them? A: Countries with large national budget deficits tend to restrict foreign trade. B: Reliable comparisons of the deficit figures of one country with those of another are impossible.

In a relatively short time failing grades disappeared from the school. The principal happily recognized this as evidence that the teaching had improved at the school. The flawed pattern of reasoning in the above is most similar to that in which one of the following? A: The nutritionist insisted that the weight gain that team members complained of was caused by overeating. In a brief time all the members stopped overeating. The nutritionist was pleased to conclude that they had stopped gaining weight. B: The nutritionist insisted that the weight gain that team members complained of was caused by their thinking of food too often. The nutritionist was happy to conclude that the weight gain had stopped once the team members reported that they had stopped thinking of food so often. C: The manager insisted that the workers who filed complaints did not have enough to do. Soon there were no more complaints filed. The manager was pleased to conclude that the workers were now productively filling their time.

Fortunately, in most prepared food tropical oils can be replaced by healthier alternatives without noticeably affecting taste. Ttherefore, intensive publicity about the disadvantage of tropical oils will be likely to result in dietary changes that will diminish many people' s risk of developing heart disease. Nutritionist: The major sources of saturated fat in the average North American diet are meat, poultry, and dairy products, not tropical oils. Thus, focusing attention on the health hazards of tropical oils would be counterproductive, because it would encourage people to believe that more substantial dietary changes are unnecessary. Which one of the following is a point at issue between the nutritionist and the consumer advocate? A: whether a diet that regularly includes large quantities of tropical oil can increase the risk of heart disease B: whether intensive publicity campaigns can be effective as a means of changing people's eating habits C: whether conducting a publicity campaign that, by focusing on the health hazards of tropical oils, persuades people to replace such oils with healthier alternatives is a good publichealth strategy D: whether more people in North America would benefit from reducing the amount of meat they consume than would benefit from eliminating tropical oils from their diets Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"C"},{"prompt":"Students in a college ethics class were asked to judge whether two magazines had been morally delinquent in publishing a particular classified advertisement that was highly offensive in its demeaning portrayal of some people. They were told only that the first magazine had undertaken to screen all classified advertisements and reject for publication those it found offensive, whereas the second magazine' s policy was to publish any advertisement received from its subscribers. Most students judged the first magazine, but not the second, to have been morally delinquent in publishing the advertisement. Which one of the following principles, if established, provides the strongest justification for the judgment that the first magazine and not the second was morally delinquent? A: If two similar agents commit two similar actions, those agents should be held to the same standard of accountability. B: Failure to uphold a moral standard is not necessarily a moral failing except for those who have specifically committed themselves to upholding that standard. C: A magazine should not be considered at fault for publishing a classified advertisement if that advertisement would not be offensive to any of the magazine's subscribers.

Conclusion: Officer Franklin should receive a Mayor' s Commendation but Officer Penn should not. From which one of the following sets of facts can the conclusion be properly drawn using the principle? A: In saving a child from drowning this year, Franklin and Penn both risked their lives beyond what could be reasonably expected of a police officer. Franklin has an exemplary record but Penn does not. B: Both Franklin and Penn have exemplary records. On several occasions this year Franklin has saved people's lives, and on many occasions this year Franklin has exceeded what could be reasonably expected of a police officer. On no occasions this year has Penn saved a person's life or exceeded what could be reasonably expected of an officer. C: Neither Franklin nor Penn has an exemplary record. But, in saving the life of an accident victim, Franklin went beyond what could be reasonably expected of a police officer. In the only case in which Penn saved someone's life this year, Penn was merely doing what could be reasonably expected of an officer under the circumstances.

Of the following, which one illustrates a principle that is most similar to the principle illustrated by the passage? A: One car model produced by an automobile manufacturer has a life expectancy that is so much longer than its other models that its great popularity requires the manufacturer to stop producing some of the other models. B: A store in a lowerincome neighborhood finds that it is unable to sell its higherpriced goods and so stocks them only when ordered by a customer. C: Automotive engineers find that it is not cost effective to manufacture a given automobile part of such high quality that it outlasts all other parts of the automobile, as doing so would not raise the overall quality of the automobile.

In contrast, efforts to curb cigarette smoking, which have emphasized the dangers of smoking rather than the positive health effects of quitting, have been highly successful. Thus, efforts to get the public to exercise regularly would be more successful if they emphasized the dangers of a sedentary lifestyle rather than the positive health effects of exercise. Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument relies? A: The health risks associated with a sedentary lifestyle are as great as those associated with smoking. B: Efforts to curb cigarette smoking would not be more successful if they emphasized the positive health effects of quitting rather than the dangers of smoking.

Since carbon dioxide levels are increased by the burning of fossil fuels and by other human industrial activities, it is obvious that these industrial activities are purely beneficial to agriculture and those of us who depend upon it. The flawed reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following? A: Consistently consuming more calories than one expends inevitably leads to excessive weight gain, so if one wishes to avoid the health problems associated with this condition, one ought to fast periodically. B: Because a high fiber diet has been shown to be more healthful than a low fiber diet, a diet in which foods with a low fiber content have been entirely replaced by foods with a high fiber content is bound to be even more healthful. C: It has been shown that one can obtain more vitamins and minerals from fresh fruits and vegetables than from processed fruits and vegetables. One ought, ttherefore, to completely abandon consumption of the latter in favor of the former.

Critics have charged that the proposal poses health risks to people who might eat the meat of treated deer and thereby ingest unsafe quantities of the hormone. The biologist has responded to these critics by pointing out that humans can ingest up to 10 milligrams of the hormone a day without any adverse effects, and since no one would eat even one entire deer a day, the treatment would be safe. The biologist's response to critics of the proposal is based on which one of the following assumptions? A: Most people do not consider deer meat to be part of their daily diet and eat it only on rare occasions.

The issue in dispute between Powell and Freeman is the A: accuracy of the figure of 60 percent with regard to the difference in service costs between private and public wasteremoval companies B: ability of private versus public wasteremoval companies to select which customers to serve C: reason private wasteremoval companies are able to offer service comparable to that offered by public ones while spending less money per customer D: relationship between the needs of a waste removal customer and the amount of money it takes to serve that customer Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"C"},{"prompt":"These days, drug companies and health professionals alike are focusing their attention on cholesterol in the blood. The more cholesterol we have in our blood, the higher the risk that we shall die of a heart attack. The issue is pertinent since heart disease kills more North Americans every year than any other single cause. At least three factors smoking, drinking, and exercise can each influence levels of cholesterol in the blood. Which one of the following can be properly concluded from the passage? A: Smoking in moderation can entail as great a risk of fatal heart disease as does heavy smoking. B: The only way that smoking increases one's risk of fatal heart disease is by influencing the levels of cholesterol in the blood.

The cornmeal is used to clean them out: they take the cornmeal in and eject the sand that they contain. But I can skip this step, because the mussels available at seafood markets are farm raised and ttherefore do not contain sand. Which one of the following is an assumption required by the chef's argument? A: The chef's mussel recipe was written before farmraised mussels became available. B: Mussels contain no contaminants other than sand. C: The mussels the chef is using for the mussel recipe came from a seafood market.

Carbon dioxide traps heat, tending to warm the atmosphere, whereas sulfur dioxide turns into sulfate aerosols that reflect sunlight back toward space, thereby tending to cool the atmosphere. Given that the heattrapping effect is stronger than the cooling effect, cutting fossilfuel emissions might be expected to slow the rise in global temperatures. Yet, surprisingly, if fossilfuel emissions were cut today, global warming would actually be enhanced for more than three decades before the temperature rise began to slow. Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the claim made in the last sentence above? A: Carbon dioxide is produced not only by automobiles but also by power plants that burn fossil fuels. B: Sulfur pollution is not spread evenly around the globe but is concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere, where there is a relatively high concentration of industry. C: Carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for many decades, while the sulfate aerosols fall out within days. D: Because fossilfuel emissions contain sulfur dioxide, they contribute not only to global warming but also to acid rain. Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"C"},{"prompt":"A transit company' s bus drivers are evaluated by supervisors riding with each driver.

That is why it does not follow that, even though his 1984 resembles other books of its futuristic genre, Orwell read those books; it is possible that he and the other authors were simply drawing on the same body of literary conventions. Which one of the following most closely illustrates the principle that the passage illustrates? A: To direct an effective movie within the cowboy genre, a director must study previously successful cowboy movies. B: A mystery novel may not resemble novels from other genres, even though it was directly influenced by such novels. C: A historical romance novel does not fit into its literary genre unless it employs certain kinds of conventions.

Most employees of the Haglut Corporation work in the manufacturing division. Furthermore, the average amount of overtime per month worked by any employee in the company generally does not fluctuate much from month to month. Ttherefore, each month, most employees of the Haglut Corporation almost certainly work at least some overtime. The debater's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which of these grounds? A: It overlooks the possibility that even if, on average, a certain amount of overtime is worked by the members of some group, many members of that group may work no overtime at all. B: It takes for granted that the manufacturing division is a typical division of the corporation with regard to the average amount of overtime its employees work each month. C: It confuses a claim from which the argument's conclusion about the Haglut Corporation would necessarily follow with a claim that would follow from the argument's conclusion only with a high degree of probability. D: It takes for granted that if a certain average amount of overtime is worked each month by each employee of the Haglut Corporation, then approximately the same amount of overtime must be worked each month by each employee of the manufacturing division.

Unless strict environmental regulations are maintained, endangered species of plants and animals will become extinct. And since a large majority of new medicines are derived from plants and animals, a general deregulatory approach could actually undermine the original intent of the relaxation of regulations governing the manufacture and sale of new medicines. The statement that a large majority of new medicines are derived from plants and animals plays which one of the following roles in the argument? A: support for the hypothesis that only very narrowly focused efforts at deregulation of industrial activity actually have beneficial results B: evidence for a point of view that the argument is designed to undermine C: a link between the extinction of species and the potentially decreased availability of new medicines D: an illustration of the potential disaster that could result from continued overregulation of industrial activity Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"C"},{"prompt":"A chimp who displays feelings of affection toward the other members of its social group is more likely to be defended by these group members from raiders outside of the group even at the risk of harm to these defenders than are those chimps who rarely or never display feelings of affection toward their associates.

It won't be playing on Friday if it plays on Saturday. So Saturday will be the only day this week on which Rollercoaster will perform. B: According to its management, Brown's Stores will move next year. Without Brown's being present, no new large store can be attracted to the downtown area. Ttherefore the downtown area will no longer be viable as a shopping district. C: An informant says that Rustimann was involved in the bank robbery. If Rustimann was involved, Jones was certainly not involved. Since these two are the only people who could have been involved, Rustimann is the only person the police need to arrest.

Furthermore, industrial pollution causes increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. So industrial pollution causes global warming. B: Voting behavior is affected by factors other than political candidates' records of political achievement. For example, a candidate who projects confidence will gain votes as a result, whereas a candidate with a supercilious facial expression will lose votes. C: Adults read less than they once did because there are so many other activities to divert them. This can be seen from the fact that the more time they spend on such other activities, the less they read. Conversely, the less they read, the more time they spend on such other activities.

The conclusion of the actor's argument can be properly drawn if which one of the following is assumed? A: An audience that cannot readily discern a character's personality will not take any interest in that character. B: All plays that, unlike Brecht's plays, have characters with whom audiences empathize succeed as dramas.

The birds, which generally live in flocks that contain only crested or only noncrested birds, tend to select mates of the same variety as themselves. However, if a bird that is raising a flock in which all other members are crested is later moved to a mixed flock, then that bird whether crested or noncrested is likely to select a crested mate. This fact indicates that the birds' preference for crested or noncrested mates is learned rather than genetically determined. Which one of the following, if true, provides the most support for the argument? A: In general there are few behavioral differences between the crested and noncrested birds of the species. B: Birds of other species also tend to show preferences for mates that have one or another specific physical feature.

Since then, the population of both caterpillars and adult moths has significantly declined in those areas. Entomologists have concluded that the decline is attributable to the presence of the poisonous fungus. Which one of the following, if true, most strongly supports the conclusion drawn by the entomologists? A: The current decline in the gypsy moth population in forests where the fungus was introduced is no greater than a decline that occurred concurrently in other forests. B: In the past several years, air pollution and acid rain have been responsible for a substantial decline in oak tree populations. C: A strain of gypsy moth whose caterpillars are unaffected by the fungus has increased its share of the total gypsy moth population. D: An increase in numbers of both gypsy moth caterpillars and gypsy moth adults followed a drop in the number of some of the species that prey on the moths. Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"C"},{"prompt":"Secret passwords are often used to control access to computers. When employees are allowed to make up their own passwords, they are likely to setup as passwords their initials or birth dates.

Hence, people on these highfat diets do not consume too many calories. The questionable pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following? A: The disorientation observed in airline pilots after transoceanic flights is caused not by sleep deprivation but by disruption in their exposure to daylight. Hence, transoceanic pilots do not suffer from sleep deprivation. B: Stock market crashes are due, not to panic in the face of predicted economic downturns, but to mere rumormongering without any basis in fact. Hence, economic downturns cannot be accurately predicted. C: The impression that most viewers of sports programming are beer drinkers is due not to mere stereotyping but to the vast number of beer commercials broadcast during televised sports. Hence, most beer drinkers are avid fans of sports programs. D: Electrical storms are strongly correlated with precipitous drops in barometric pressure. So, electrical storms are caused by such drops in pressure, rather than by air turbulence.

That is, if determinism is true, then the events that are presently occurring could not have failed to occur given the state of the universe a moment ago. Determinism, however, is false because it is impossible to know the complete state of the universe at any given time since it is impossible to measure accurately both the position and velocity of any given subatomic particle at a particular time. The physicist's reasoning is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds? A: That it is impossible to know the complete state of the universe at any given time does not imply that there is no complete state of the universe at that time. B: That it is impossible to measure accurately both the position and velocity of any given subatomic particle does not imply that it is impossible to know either the position or velocity of all subatomic particles. C: That the position and velocity of any given subatomic particle cannot be jointly measured with accuracy does not imply that this is the case for the position and velocity of all subatomic particles.

Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the economist's argument? A: If a corporation obtains a monopoly, the disadvantage to consumers of any higher prices will be outweighed by the advantages from extra investments in expensive research or industrial infrastructure made by that corporation. B: The government's permitting a corporation to obtain a monopoly is advantageous for consumers only if that corporation passes the fruits of at least some of its investments on to consumers. C: The benefits to consumers are typically greater if a corporation invests in expensive research or industrial infrastructure than if that corporation spends the same amount of money in any other way.

Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main conclusion drawn in the argument? A: Personal conflicts are not inevitable. B: It is irrational to allow a single instance to turn one's suspicion that a friend is unreliable into a feeling of certainty. C: Even when there is more evidence of good qualities than of bad ones, people find it easier to ascribe bad qualities than good ones. D: Unlike a suspicion that a friend is unreliable, a belief that someone is reliable is normally built up only after many years of personal interaction.

Some others toxaphene, dieldrin, and chlordane were banned or restricted in many countries in the 1980s but linger in the environment. All four have a weak effect individually in increasing estrogen levels in women. Scientists have found, however, that their potential to cause health hazards increases dramatically when the chemicals are combined. For example, a mixture of endosulfan and dieldrin had 160 to 1, 600 times more estrogenboosting potency than either chemical did individually. Increased estrogen is associated with an increased cancer risk in women. Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above? A: Any two pesticides in combination pose greater health risks than do the same pesticides uncombined. B: If certain pesticides combine in the environment, they may constitute greatly increased human health hazards. C: Pesticides that boost estrogen levels are more dangerous than others. D: Because of its hazards when combined with other chemicals, endosulfan is more dangerous than most other pesticides. Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"B"},{"prompt":"Journalist: In physics journals, the number of articles reporting the results of experiments involving particle accelerators was lower last year than it had been in previous years. Several of the particle accelerators at major research institutions were out of service the year before last for repairs, so it is likely that the low number of articles was due to the decline in availability of particle accelerators. Which of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the journalist's argument? A: The number of physics journals was the same last year as in previous years. B: Every article based on experiments with particle accelerators that was submitted for publication last year actually was published. C: Recent changes in the editorial policies of several physics journals have decreased the likelihood that articles concerning particle accelerator research will be accepted for publication.

In a recent test, an orchestra played a hundred selections from different wellknown classical pieces; in approximately half of the selections, exactly one instrument would be played slightly out of tune. In every instance in which an instrument was played out of tune, Domingo pointed out that the orchestra was out of tune, and correctly identified the instrument at fault. Which of the following, if true, most strongly supports the conclusion of the argument above? A: During the test, the orchestra was arranged in a traditional arrangement, similar to the arrangement in which they would be seated in a classical concert. B: Because the test was performed in an empty concert hall, the acoustics of the concert hall differed somewhat from those of a concert hall populated by an audience. C: The instruments played out of tune were all played at a pitch exactly one halfstep lower than the true pitch. D: Domingo did not mistakenly label any of the orchestra's intune performances as out of tune. Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"D"},{"prompt":"Budget constraints have made police officials consider reassigning a considerable number of officers from traffic enforcement to work on higherpriority, serious crimes. Reducing traffic enforcement for this reason would be counterproductive, however, in light of the tendency of criminals to use cars when engaged in the commission of serious crimes. An officer stopping a car for a traffic violation can make a search that turns up evidence of serious crime. Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument given? A: When the public becomes aware that traffic enforcement has lessened, it typically becomes lax in obeying traffic rules. B: The great majority of persons who are stopped by officers for traffic violations are not guilty of any serious crimes. C: Those willing to break the law to commit serious crimes are often in committing such crimes unwilling to observe what they regard as the lesser constraints of traffic law.

A second group of psychologists claims that empathic response is not, by itself, moral behavior and that in order to count as moral, behavior must be based on a clear understanding of moral principles and a certain degree of moral reasoning skill. On the basis of children' s unsophisticated verbal responses to hypothetical moral dilemmas, these psychologists conclude that children lack the degree of moral reasoning skill necessary for their behavior, however compassionate, to be considered moral. Which one of the following is consistent with the claims of the first group of psychologists and inconsistent with the claims of the second group of psychologists? A: The morality of an action should be judged on the basis of the intention behind it rather than on the basis of its consequences. B: People with strong empathic responses are less likely to be skilled in moral reasoning than people with weaker empathic responses. C: Cats and dogs, which are incapable of moral reasoning but capable of empathic responses, are capable of moral behavior. D: People with strong empathic responses are more likely to be skilled in moral reasoning than are people with weaker empathic responses. Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"C"},{"prompt":"Consumer advocate: Manufacturers of children' s toys often place warnings on their products that overstate the dangers their products pose. Productwarning labels should overstate dangers only if doing so reduces injuries. In fact, however, manufacturers overstate their products' dangers merely for the purpose of protecting themselves from lawsuits brought by parents of injured children. Ttherefore, manufacturers of children' s toys should not overstate the dangers their products pose. Which one of the following most accurately describes a reasoning flaw in the consumer advocate's argument? A: The argument confuses a necessary condition for reducing the number of injuries caused by a product with a sufficient condition. B: The argument relies on the unjustified assumption that an action has an effect only if it was performed in order to bring about that effect. C: The argument presumes, without providing justification, that if a warning overstates a danger, then the warning will fail to prevent injuries. D: The argument overlooks the possibility that warnings that do not overstate the dangers that their products pose do not always reduce injuries. Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"B"},{"prompt":"Of the many works in a collection from Japan' s Tokugawa period that the museum will soon put on display, those that are most sensitive to light, as well as the most valuable pieces, will be on display for two weeks only. Sakai Hoitsu' s Spring and Autumn Maples will be on display for two weeks only, so it is clearly among the most valuable pieces in the collection. The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above most closely parallels that in which one of the following? A: The city council will soon commission surveyors to update the city map. The new map will reflect existing structures as well as planned housing developments. But the housing development I live in was built several decades ago, so it will not be on the updated map. B: The legend on this city map indicates that historical monuments are designated by purple dots. Hospitals are also designated by purple dots. There is a purple dot on Wilson Street. So there must be a hospital on Wilson Street. C: On this city map, a solid line designates the city limits. Solid lines also designate major thoroughfares. So there is no way of determining whether a particular solid line on the map is a thoroughfare or an indicator of the city limits. D: I have just purchased the new city map, whose legend indicates that thoroughfares are marked by solid lines and that dotted lines designate oneway streets. Shearing Street is marked by a dotted line, even though it is a thoroughfare. So the mapmakers must have made a mistake.

To reduce unemployment, the government proposes to supplement the income of those who accept jobs that pay less than government assistance, thus enabling employers to hire workers cheaply. However, the supplement will not raise any worker' s income above what government assistance would provide if he or she were not gainfully employed. Ttherefore, unemployed people will have no financial incentive to accept jobs that would entitle them to the supplement. Which of the following, if true about Ledland, most seriously weakens the argument of the editorial? A: People who are employed and look for a new job tend to get higherpaying jobs than job seekers who are unemployed. B: The yearly amount unemployed people receive from government assistance is less than the yearly income that the government defines as the poverty level. C: Neighboring countries with laws that mandate the minimum wage an employer must pay an employee have higher unemployment rates than Ledland currently has.

This behavior, called cooperative breeding, results from the scarcity of nesting territory for the birds on the tiny island that, until recently, was home to the world' s population of Seychelles warblers. Yet when healthy warblers were transplanted to a much larger neighboring island as part of an experiment, most of those warblers maintained a pattern of cooperative breeding. Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the result of the experiment? A: Most of the terrain on the neighboring island was not of the type in which Seychelles warblers generally build their nests. B: Cooperative breeding in species other than the Seychelles warbler often results when the environment cannot sustain a rise in the population. C: The climate of the island to which Seychelles warblers were transplanted was the same as that of the warblers' native island. D: The Seychelles warblers had fewer competitors for nesting territory on the island to which they were transplanted than on their native island.

Some experts suggest secret varnishes, but there is no evidence for this. However, climatologists have found that in the 1600s and early 1700s weather patterns in the region of Italy where Stradivarius worked affected tree growth to produce wood with special acoustic properties. Ttherefore, it is likely that__. Which one of the following most logically completes the argument? A: Stradivarius was the only violin maker in the early 1700s to use the wood produced in that part of Italy B: no violin made from presentday materials could rival a Stradivarius violin for sound quality C: the special qualities of Stradivarius violins are due in part to the wood used to make them D: some other Italian violin makers in the early 1700s produced violins that equaled the quality of Stradivarius violins Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"C"},{"prompt":"Novelist: Any author who thinks a sentence is ungrammatical will not write it down in the first place, and thus will have no need to use a grammar book. On the other hand, any author who is sure a sentence she or he has written is grammatical will not feel a need to consult a grammar book. Thus, grammar books are useless as reference sources for authors. The reasoning in the novelist's argument is flawed because the argument A: presumes, without providing justification, that grammar books cannot have any use except as reference sources B: infers, from the claim that an author does not mistakenly think that a sentence is ungrammatical, that the author will feel sure that it is grammatical C: ignores the possibility that there is a middle ground between being sure that a sentence is grammatical and thinking that it is ungrammatical D: infers, from the claim that authors should not consult grammar books, that they will not in fact do so Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"C"},{"prompt":"Although it has been suggested that Arton' s plays have a strong patriotic flavor, we must recall that, at the time of their composition, her country was in anything but a patriotic mood.

Realizing this, we see clearly that any apparent patriotism in Arton' s work must have been intended ironically. The reasoning above is questionable because it A: overlooks the fact that some citizens prosper in times of high unemployment B: takes for granted that Arton was attuned to the predominant national attitude of her time C: posits an unstated relationship between unemployment and crime D: takes for granted that straightforward patriotism is not possible for a serious writer Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"B"},{"prompt":"Many doctors cater to patients' demands that they be prescribed antibiotics for their colds.

This very completeness makes one point stand out; in five different years, villages overwhelmingly reported significant population declines. Tellingly, each of those five years immediately followed an increase in a certain Drindian tax. This tax, which was assessed on villages, was computed by the central government using the annual census figures. Obviously, whenever the tax went up, villages had an especially powerful economic incentive to minimize the number of people they recorded; and concealing the size of a village' s population from government census takers would have been easy. Ttherefore, it is reasonable to think that the <b> reported declines did not happen </b>. In the historian's argument, the two portions in boldface play which of the following roles?

This is unusual in the advertising world, where companies typically strive for uniformity in advertising in order to establish a brand identity with their target demographic. But in this case variety is a smart approach, since purchasers of auto insurance are so demographically diverse. Which one of the following, if true, adds the most support for the conclusion of the argument? A: Advertising campaigns designed to target one demographic sometimes appeal to a wider group of people than expected. B: Advertising campaigns that target one demographic often alienate people who are not part of the target demographic. C: Fewer people are influenced by auto insurance commercials than by commercials for other types of products.

The project was a dismal failure, however; salespersons rarely accessed the database and continued to rely on many paper files, which they had refused to tum over to the staff responsible for creating the database. Which one of the following, if true, most helps to account for the failure described above? A: All of the salespersons were required to attend a series of training sessions for the new database software even though many of them found the software easy to use even without training. B: The number of staff required to create the database turned out to be larger than anticipated, and the company had to pay overtime wages to some of them. C: Most of the salespersons already had portable computers before the new database was created.

This year, to determine the division for which an aspirant is best qualified, the league held a weeklong trial, after which coach A and coach B selected players. Coach A nominated sixteen of the forty players for the senior league. Amongst Coach B's nominations for the senior division were four players not nominated by Coach A. Ttherefore, there will be twenty players in the senior division. Which of the following, if true, provides the strongest basis for the conclusion above to be warranted? A: Of the sixteen players nominated by the coach A, coach B nominated more than half to play in the senior division. B: The four players that Coach B but not Coach A selected for the senior division played the previous year in that division.

While such a phenomenon may sound counterintuitive, a forger is able to exploit current modes of aesthetics to create paintings that appeal to the eye of his or her contemporaries. This very quality, however, is what makes those paintings seem amateurish to subsequent generations. As a result, a majority of forgeries are identified as such roughly twentyfive years after their creation. Which of the following is an assumption upon which the argument rests? A: A piece of art determined to be a forgery does not, after a period of twentyfive years, become valued for its own intrinsic merits. B: A generation consists of exactly twentyfive years.

The roots of melon plants perform less efficiently under the lowoxygen conditions present in rainsoaked soil. When the efficiency of melon roots is impaired, the roots do not supply sufficient amounts of the proper nutrients for the plants to perform photosynthesis at their usual levels. It follows that melon plants have a lowerthanusual rate of photosynthesis when their roots are in rainsoaked soil. When the photosynthesis of the plants slows, sugar stored in the fruits is drawn off to supply the plants with energy. Ttherefore, ripe melons harvested after a prolonged period of heavy rain should be less sweet than other ripe melons.

The reasoning in the historian's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument A: makes use of an assumption that one would accept only if one has already accepted the truth of the conclusion B: takes for granted that anyone who is motivated purely by snobbery cannot also be motivated by legitimate historical evidence C: fails to exclude the possibility that there might be legitimate evidence motivating those who reject Shakespeare's authorship D: presumes, without providing justification, that a claim cannot be true if those who advance it are motivated by snobbery Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"C"},{"prompt":"Politician: The huge amounts of money earned by oil companies elicit the suspicion that the regulations designed to prevent collusion need to be tightened. But just the opposite is true. If the regulations designed to prevent collusion are not excessively burdensome, then oil companies will make profits sufficient to motivate the very risky investments associated with exploration that must be made if society is to have adequate oil supplies. But recent data show that the oil industry' s profits are not the highest among all industries. Clearly, the regulatory burden on oil companies has become excessive. The reasoning in the politician's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument A: fails to justify its presumption that profits sufficient to motivate very risky investments must be the highest among all industries B: illicitly draws a general conclusion from a specific example that there is reason to think is atypical C: fails to justify its presumption that two events that are correlated must also be causally related D: attacks the character of the oil companies rather than the substance of their conduct Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"A"},{"prompt":"Bigbudget movies often gross two or three times the cost of their production and marketing.

However, linguistic ability is not the possession and utilization of a body of knowledge, or rules of grammar, but is more similar to a skill like riding a bicycle. Just as the typical cyclist does not need to know physics, neither does the language user need to know grammar rules. Which one of the following most accurately expresses a principle underlying the essayist's argument? A: There is a difference between knowing a set of rules and behaving in accordance with a set of rules. B: Not everyone follows the same set of rules in acquiring a skill.

Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument relies? A: Holders of life insurance policies do not have longer overall life expectancies than the general population. B: Some people would be unwilling to modify their weights solely to increase the general population's overall life expectancies. C: The tables include data gathered from policyholders whose deaths resulted from accidents in addition to those whose deaths resulted from natural causes.

Campisi: I find your inference unconvincing; several leavens other than yeast could have been known in 1200 B. C. Campisi counters Yang's argument by A: questioning the truth of a presumption underlying Yang's argument B: suggesting that an alternative set of evidence better supports Yang's conclusion C: calling into question the truth of the evidence presented in Yang's argument D: pointing out that the premises of Yang's argument more strongly support a contrary conclusion Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"A"},{"prompt":"Liang: Watching movies in which violence is portrayed as an appropriate way to resolve problems increases levels of aggression in viewers.

Hence, the access by mature audiences to such forms of entertainment should not be restricted. The dialogue provides the most support for inferring that Liang and Sarah agree with each other that A: if violence in certain movies causes violence in viewers, access to those movies should be restricted B: people who experience an emotion vicariously are likely to purge themselves of that emotion C: the members of a mature audience are unlikely to believe that violence is sometimes an appropriate way to resolve problems D: the effects of dramatic depictions of violence on audiences are at least partially understood Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"D"},{"prompt":"Philosopher: It is absurd to argue that people are morally obligated to act in a certain way simply because not acting in that way would be unnatural.

Investigators recently discovered a gap between Vasari' s wall and the original, large enough to have preserved anything painted on the original. Historians believe that Leonardo da Vinci had painted, but left unfinished, a mural on the original wall; some historians had also believed that by 1563 the mural had been destroyed. However, it is known that in the late 1560s, when renovating another building, Santa MariaNovella, Vasari built a facade over its frescoes, and the frescoes were thereby preserved. Thus, Leonardo' s Palazzo Vecchio mural probably still exists behind Vasari' s wall. Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends? A: When Vasari preserved the frescoes of Santa Maria Novella he did so secretly. B: Vasari probably would not have built the Palazzo Vecchio wall with a gap behind it except to preserve something behind the new wall.

Our audience is not the students, but the administration committee that approves space and funding for the project. We should instead appeal directly to the administrators to act in the name of progress and technology. Which one of the following principles, if valid, most justifies Myers stance? A: Appealing to students will in turn appeal to the proposal's committee. Students are the lifeblood of the university and it's critical that the committee determine whether or not students are on board. B: Proposals should appeal to the project's recipients, or those who the project will directly affect. This way, the project will gain support from its followers.

The writers will choose to maximize their audience, so the characters will not be developed in a more realistic manner. Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its reasoning to the argument above? A: If a company's failure is due to a broader economic collapse, then it is not fair to blame the company's executives for the failure. There was a broader economic collapse when ViqCo went bankrupt. So it is probably not fair to blame ViqCo's executives for the failure. B: Since ViqCo's failure was due to a broader economic collapse, it is not fair to blame the company's executives for the failure. But that means that when ViqCo was succeeding because the broader economy was growing, the executives did not deserve the credit. C: If ViqCo's executives were responsible for the company's losses, then ViqCo's losses would have been greater than those of its competitors. But ViqCo's losses were less than those of its competitors. So ViqCo's executives were not responsible for the company's losses. D: If ViqCo's executives were responsible for the company's failure, then it must be possible to say what they should have done differently.

Essentially, if one knows whether one is receiving actual medicine or a placebo, such knowledge can affect the outcome of a study. A recent doubleblind study on the effectiveness of the Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) Freloxamine on depression found that those subjects administered the drug were 15% more likely to have a decrease in symptoms than the control group, which was comprised of those who received a placebo. Since neither group knew which they were receiving, the placebo or the SSRI, the observed drop in depression can only be attributed to Freloxamine. Which of the following, if true, best calls into question the conclusion of the argument? A: Neither the subjects nor the doctors in either group (the control group or the Freloxamine group) knew which drug they were receiving. B: At dosages twofold of those employed in the trial, Freloxamine has been shown to cause brief episodes of psychosis. C: Since subjects in both groups were debriefed on the potential side effects of SSRI, which can often be pronounced, many in the Freloxamine group, upon exhibiting side effects, concluded that they were being administered the SSRI. D: Freloxamine does not exhibit a uniform effect in all subjects, with many reporting little improvement in symptoms of depression, even after several months of taking the drug.

If patients with heart disease take the medication under careful medical supervision, however, harmful side effects can definitely be averted. The concern about those side effects is thus unfounded. The argument depends on which one of the following assumptions? A: The new medication has various other side effects, but none as serious as that of exacerbating heart disease. B: No migraine sufferers with heart disease will take the new medication except under careful medical supervision. C: The new medication actually is effective when taken by patients with heart disease. D: The new medication will displace all migraine medications currently being used.

The government also contends that its recent action to limit the nuclear industry' s financial liability in the case of nuclear accidents at power plants is justified by the need to protect the nuclear industry from the threat of bankruptcy. But even the government says that unlimited liability poses such a threat only if injury claims can be sustained against the industry; and the government admits that for such claims to be sustained, injury must result from a nuclear accident. The public' s fear, ttherefore, is well founded. If all of the statements offered in support of the editorial's conclusion correctly describe the government's position, which one of the following must also be true on the basis of those statements? A: The government's claim about the safety of the country's nuclear power plants is false. B: Unlimited financial liability in the case of nuclear accidents poses no threat to the financial security of the country's nuclear industry. C: The government's position on nuclear power plants is inconsistent. D: The government misrepresented its reasons for acting to limit the nuclear industry's liability.

Which one of the following, if true, justifies the given application of the principle above? A: Some people that an employee of a telemarketing agency calls to ask them to buy the product of a client of the agency will refuse to do so even though they are not predisposed to dislike the client. B: Any employee of a telemarketing agency who tries to get someone to buy the product of a client of the agency after the person has said that he or she does not want to will engender animosity toward the client. C: Some employees of telemarketing agencies are unlikely to be certain about whether trying to talk someone into buying the product of a client of the agency after the person has said that he or she does not want to will likely engender animosity toward the client.

This increase can be readily explained by consumers' desire not to postpone purchases that will surely increase in price. But during protracted periods of inflation, consumers eventually begin to put off making even routine purchases, despite the fact that consumers continue to expect prices to rise and despite the fact that salaries also rise during inflationary periods. Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the apparent inconsistency in consumer behavior described above? A: Consumers' purchasing power decreases during periods of protracted inflation since salaries do not keep pace with prices. B: There is usually a lag between the leading economic indicators' first signaling the onset of an inflationary period and consumers' recognition of its onset.

Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the surprising results of suchs investments? A: Expanding production in such companies would usually require more funds than would paying off debts. B: Banks are reluctant to lend money to any company that is already heavily in debt and chronically unprofitable.

The proposition that the public is now more interested in reading and hearing about crime plays which one of the following roles in the argument? A: It is a generalization based on the claim that the crime rate has increased over the past ten years. B: It is presented as evidence that the media decide what to cover and to what extent to cover it depending on the interests of the public.

A: The plaintiff accuses the defendant of violating campaign laws, but the accusations are ill founded. While the defendant's actions may violate certain laws, they are not immoral, because the laws in question are unjust. B: The plaintiff accuses the defendant of voting only for campaign laws that would favor the defendant's party. This accusation is ill founded, however, because it attacks the defendant's motivations instead of addressing the arguments the defendant has put forth justifying these votes. C: The plaintiff accuses the defendant of violating campaign laws, but these accusations show the plaintiff to be hypocritical, because the plaintiff has engaged in similar conduct.

In those days, farmers needed their children to have long breaks during which they could remain at home and help with the harvest. The contemporary school year is thus made up of periods of study interspersed with long breaks. But agricultural life no longer occupies most of our citizens, so we can now make changes that serve the interests of children. Ttherefore, long breaks should be removed from the school calendar. Which one of the following is an assumption on which the editorial's argument depends? A: During long breaks children have a tendency to forget what they have learned. B: A change in the present school calendar that shortened breaks would serve the interests of agricultural life. C: A school calendar made up of periods of study without long breaks would serve the interests of children more than a school calendar with long breaks. D: Long breaks in the school calendar should be replaced with breaks that are no longer than workers' average vacations.

Asked about the effort they would apply in the respective cases, the volunteers indicated, on average, that they would run slower in the race against the greater number of people. A likely explanation of this result is that those of the volunteers who were most comparatively inclinedthose who most tended to compare themselves with others in the social environmentdetermined (perhaps unconsciously) that extreme effort would not be worthwhile in the 500competitor race. Which of the following would, if known to be true, most help justify the explanation offered above? A: The volunteers who were the least comparatively inclined had no greater desire to win the 1, 000 than those who were the most comparatively inclined. B: The most comparatively inclined volunteers believed that they were significantly less likely to finish in the top 10 percent in the race against 500 than in the race against 50. C: The volunteers who were most comparatively inclined were also those that had the greatest desire to win a 1, 000 prize.

So any client improvement in shortterm psychotherapy must be the result of some aspect or aspects of therapy that are common to all psychotherapies for example, the presence of someone who listens and gives attention to the client. Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the researcher's argument? A: The studies found that psychotherapy by a trained counselor does not result in any greater improvement, on average, among clients than does simple counseling by an untrained layperson. B: On average, clients improve more dramatically when they receive longterm psychotherapy, a year or longer in duration, than when clients receive shortterm psychotherapy.

In short, a large category of major decisions is turned over to business executives. Thus, business executives have become public officials. Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the economist's argument? A: What a country produces and in what quantities is not always completely controlled by corporate executives.

The wetter the laundry, the more energy required to dry it in an automatic dryer. Thus using these new types of washing machines could result in an overall increase in the energy needed to wash and dry a load of laundry. In which one of the following is the pattern of reasoning most parallel to that in the argument above? A: The more weights added to an exercise machine, the greater the muscle strength needed to work out on the machine. Up to a point, using more muscle strength can make a person stronger. Thus an exercise machine with more weights can, but does not necessarily, make a person stronger. B: Pine is a less expensive wood than cedar but is more susceptible to rot. Outdoor furniture made from wood susceptible to rot must be painted with more expensive paint. Ttherefore, building outdoor furniture from pine rather than cedar could increase the total cost of building and painting the furniture. C: The more skill required to operate a machine, the harder it is to find people able to do it, and thus the more those people must be paid. Ttherefore, if a factory installs machines that require highly skilled operators, it must be prepared to pay higher wages. D: The more people who work in the library's reading room, the noisier the room becomes; and the noisier the working environment, the less efficiently people work.

However, perhaps part of the decline results from injuries going unreported: many employers have introduced safetyincentive programs, such as prize drawings for which only employees who have a perfect worksafety record are eligible. Since a workplace injury would disqualify an employee from such programs, some employees might be concealing injury, when it is feasible to do so. Which of the following, if true in Gilavia, most strongly supports the proposed explanation? A: Employers generally have to pay financial compensation to employees who suffer workrelated injuries. B: In the last five years, there has been no decline in the number of workplace injuries leading to immediate admission to a hospital emergency room. C: Employers who have instituted safetyincentive programs do not in general have a lower proportion of reported workplace injuries among their employees than do employers without such programs. D: Many injuries that happen on the job are injuries that would be impossible to conceal and yet would not be severe enough to require any change to either the employee's work schedule or the employee's job responsibilities.

The cost of maintaining the highways is paid entirely out of revenue from the highway tolls. Holston must maintain its highways. Thus, it follows that if the tolls are eliminated, then the entire cost of maintaining the highways will have to be paid for by an increase in general taxes. Which one of the following is an assumption made by the argument? A: The amount of money saved by eliminating the costs associated with toll collection would not be available to pay part of the total cost of maintaining the highways. B: The total cost of maintaining the highways will be less if the highway tolls rather than the general taxes pay for the maintenance. C: If the highway tolls are not eliminated, there will be no need to increase the general taxes.

Ttherefore, neither tragedy nor comedy can be classified as satirical literature or romance literature. The critic's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed? A: If a character in a tragedy is idealized at the beginning of the action depicted in the tragedy, he or she must be debased at the end. B: Some characters in comedies and tragedies are neither debased nor idealized. C: In romance literature and satirical literature, characters' moral qualities do not change during the course of the action.

However, it may well be that bridge is simply a more enjoyable game for people who already have good shortterm memory and who are thus more inclined to play. In countering the original conclusion the reasoning above uses which one of the following techniques? A: conceding the suggested relationship between playing bridge and shortterm memory, but questioning whether any conclusion about appropriate therapy can be drawn B: arguing that the original conclusion relied on an inaccurate understanding of the motives that the people surveyed have for playing bridge C: providing an alternative hypothesis to explain the data on which the original conclusion was based D: challenging the representativeness of the sample surveyed Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"C"},{"prompt":"Editorial: In order to encourage personal responsibility in adults, society should not restrict the performance of any of the actions of adults or interfere with the likely results except to prevent negative effects on others.

For drivers who speed do not risk only their own lives; such drivers often injure or kill other people. Moreover, speed limits have been shown to significantly reduce highway accident and fatality rates. B: Even though public smoking may lead to indirect harm to others, it should not be banned. There are several other ways to eliminate this harm that do not restrict the conduct of smokers and hence are preferable to a complete ban on public smoking. C: The scientist who invented this technology is not the only one who should be allowed to profit from it. After all, there is no evidence that allowing others to profit from this technology will reduce the scientist's own profits.

Ttherefore, if we want to ensure that chemicals from plants are available for use in the future, we must make more serious efforts to preserve for all time our natural resources. Y: But living things are not our resources. Yours is a selfish approach to conservation. We should rather strive to preserve living species because they deserve to survive, not because of the good they can do us. Which one of the following is an issue about which X and Y disagree? A: whether the cost of preserving plant species outweighs the cost of artificially synthesizing chemicals that could otherwise be derived from those species B: whether it is prudent to conserve natural resources C: whether the benefits humans derive from exploiting nonhuman species provide a good reason for preserving nonhuman species D: whether humans should make efforts to prevent the extinction of living species Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"C"},{"prompt":"Speaker: Like many contemporary critics, Smith argues that the true meaning of an author' s statements can be understood only through insight into the author' s social circumstances. But this same line of analysis can be applied to Smith' s own words. Thus, if she is right we should be able, at least in part, to discern from Smith' s social circumstances the true meaning of Smith' s statements. This, in turn, suggests that Smith herself is not aware of the true meaning of her own words. The speaker's main conclusion logically follows if which one of the following is assumed? A: There is just one meaning that Smith intends her work to have. B: Smith's theory about the relation of social circumstances to the understanding of meaning lacks insight.

Since high courts of the past often repudiated legal precedents and no harm to the legal system ensued, these critics' objections must be politically motivated and ought to be ignored. Mary: High courts have repudiated precedents in the past, but they were careful to do so only when the previous rulings were old and had clearly become outdated. The recently overturned rulings were themselves recent. Overturning any recent legal ruling diminishes the law, which comes to be viewed as unstable and capricious. Which one of the following most accurately expresses the point at issue between Tom and Mary? A: whether the overturning of recent high court precedents was politically motivated B: whether judicial decisions that seem progressive at first can quickly become outdated C: whether the overturning of recent high court precedents will harm the legal system D: whether critics of recent high court decisions in fact advanced the claim Tom cites Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"C"},{"prompt":"Overexposure to certain wavelengths of strong sunlight is the main cause of melanoma, a virulent form of skin cancer.

In 1936, Sir James Gray calculated the force dolphins should be able to exert based on their physiology. <b> He concluded that the propulsive force they were able to exert was not enough to explain how fast they swim and accelerate. </b> In the 2000s, experimenters used special computerenhanced measurements of the water in which dolphins were swimming. Through mathematical modeling, they were able to measure the force dolphins exert with their tails. As it turns out, dolphins exert considerably more force with their tails than Sir James Gray or anybody else ever expected. <b> Ttherefore, the force exerted by their tails easily explains how fast they swim and accelerate. </b> In the argument, the two portions in boldface play which of the following roles? A: The first is a generally held assumption; the second is a conclusion that violates that assumption. B: This first is a piece of evidence supporting the main conclusion; the second is the main conclusion.

For example, Dr. Snow has recorded the success of a number of blackbirds in several successive years. He finds that birds nesting for the first time are less successful in breeding than are older birds, and also less successful than they themselves are a year later. This cannot be a mere matter of size and strength, since blackbirds, like the great majority of birds, are fully grown when they leave the nest. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that they benefit by their nesting experience. Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the argument? A: Up to 25 percent of all birds are killed by predators before they start to nest. B: The breeding success of birds nesting for the second time is greater than that of birds nesting for the first time. C: Blackbirds build better nests than other birds.

The anchovies were apparently tainted with domoic acid, a harmful neurotoxin. However, a dramatic drop in the population of P. australis plankton to numbers more normal for local coastal waters indicates that it is once again safe to eat locally caught anchovies. Which one of the following, if true, would most help to explain why it is now safe to lift the advisory? A: Scientists have used P. australis plankton to obtain domoic acid in the laboratory. B: A sharp decline in the population of P. australis is typically mirrored by a corresponding drop in the local anchovy population. C: P. australis naturally produces domoic acid, though anchovies consume enough to become toxic only when the population of P. australis is extraordinarily large.

Thus, although there is no harm in paying for status if that is what one wants, one should know that one is paying for prestige, not quality. Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its reasoning to the argument above? A: Many theatrical actors cannot enjoy watching a play because when they watch others, they yearn to be on stage themselves. Thus, although there is no harm in yearning to perform, such performers should, for their own sakes, learn to suppress that yearning. B: Those beginning a new hobby sometimes quit it because of the frustrations involved in learning a new skill. Thus, although it is fine to try to learn a skill quickly, one is more likely to learn a skill if one first learns to enjoy the process of acquiring it. C: Personal charm is often confused with virtue. Thus, while there is nothing wrong with befriending a charming person, anyone who does so should realize that a charming friend is not necessarily a good and loyal friend.

But extensive neurological research on mammals shows that they are all capable of feeling pain, just as dogs and horses are. Hence, this proposal should be extended to all experimentation on all mammals. Miranda: Yet the issue of pain is not the crux of the matter. Experimentation on any nonhuman animal undermines respect for life itself because only humans are capable of consenting to an experiment. Since any activity that undermines respect for life diminishes the quality of all of our lives, the new regulations should ban all such experimentation. Which one of the following is a principle that, if established, would best support Jeff's conclusion? A: Scientific experimentation should be prohibited on any creature that is capable of feeling pain. B: Only those experiments on animals that are known to cause those animals pain should be prohibited. C: Regulations on the use of animals in scientific experimentation should be primarily concerned with respecting the feelings of the humans who will perform those experiments.

More lead paint remains in older apartment buildings than newer ones because the use of lead paint was common until only two decades ago. Yet these same scientists also agree that laws requiring the removal of lead paint from older apartment buildings will actually increase the amount of lead that children living in older apartment buildings ingest. Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy in the scientists' beliefs? A: Other sources of lead in older apartment buildings are responsible for most of the lead that children living in these buildings ingest. B: The money required to finance the removal of lead paint from apartment walls could be spent in ways more likely to improve the health of children. C: Removing lead paint from walls disperses a great deal of lead dust, which is more easily ingested by children than is paint on walls.

The tropics were quite susceptible to fire at that time because of the widespread drought caused by an unusually strong El Nino, an occasional global weather phenomenon. Many scientists believe the strength of the El Nino was enhanced by the global warming caused by air pollution. Which one of the following can be properly inferred from the information above? A: Forest fires in the tropics are generally larger and more intense than usual during a strong El Nino. B: If the El Nino in 1997 had not been unusually strong, few if any large and intense forest fires would have swept the tropics in that year. C: Air pollution was largely responsible for the size and intensity of the forest fires that swept the tropics in 1997. D: If air pollution enhanced the strength of the El Nino in 1997, then it also contributed to the widespread drought in that year.

These children' s elevated bloodlead levels probably result from lead added to gasoline, since, although gasoline sold in and around Arumville has been leadfree since 1990, lead from vehicle exhaust remains in the soil for many years. Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument? A: In Arumville, children's bloodlead levels typically rise during the warm summer months when children frequently play outdoors but not in the winter when children spend more time indoors. B: Sales of leadbased paint for use in homes was banned in Arumville in 1977. C: Vehicle traffic in most residential areas of Arumville is heavier today than it was twenty years ago.

Even a much younger child who runs away when she sees her father roaring and prowling like a lion does not act as though she thinks her father is actually a lion. If she believed that, she would be terrified. The pleasure children get from makebelieve would be impossible to explain if they could not distinguish the real from the pretend. Which one of the following most accurately expresses the overall conclusion drawn in the argument? A: Children would be terrified if they believed they were in the presence of a real lion. B: Children apparently have a reasonably sophisticated understanding of what is real and what is pretend.

For example, industrialists see water retention and drainage as different and opposite functions that good topsoil both drains and retains water is a fact alien to industrial logic. To facilitate water retention, they use a terrace or a dam; to facilitate drainage, they use drain tile, a ditch, or a subsoiler. More farming problems are created than solved when agriculture is the domain of the industrialist, not of the farmer. The situation as Madden describes it best illustrates which one of the following propositions? A: The handling of water drainage and retention is the most important part of good farming. B: Industrial solutions for problems in farming should never be sought. C: Farmers are better than anyone else at solving farming problems. D: The problems of farming should be viewed in all their complexity.

Whether a work of art possesses this property is dependent upon context. Yet there are no clear criteria for determining whether contextdependent properties are present in an object, so there cannot be any clear criteria for determining whether an object qualifies as art. The reasoning above is questionable because it fails to exclude the possibility that A: aesthetically relevant properties other than representation can determine whether an object is a work of art B: some objects that represent things other than themselves are not works of art C: because some works of art are nonrepresentational, there is no way of judging our aesthetic experience of them D: an object may have some aesthetic properties and not be a work of art Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"A"},{"prompt":"Social critic: One of the most important ways in which a society socializes children is by making them feel ashamed of their immoral behavior. But in many people this shame results in deep feelings of guilt and selfloathing that can be a severe hardship. Thus, moral socialization has had a net effect of increasing the total amount of suffering. The social critic's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it A: presumes, without providing justification, that a phenomenon that supposedly increases the total amount of suffering in a society should ttherefore be changed or eliminated, regardless of its beneficial consequences B: presumes, without providing justification, that if many people have a negative psychological reaction to a phenomenon, then no one can have a positive reaction to that phenomenon C: fails to address adequately the possibility that one phenomenon may causally contribute to the occurrence of another, even though the two phenomena do not always occur together D: takes for granted that a behavior that sometimes leads to a certain phenomenon cannot also significantly reduce the overall occurrence of that phenomenon Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"D"},{"prompt":"Oxygenated petrol, although it reduces pollution, causes frequent stalling in poorly maintained automobiles.

Since apartments clearly are available, homelessness is not a housing problem. Homelessness can, ttherefore, only be caused by people' s inability or unwillingness to work to pay the rent. Maria: On the contrary, all recent studies show that a significant percentage of this city' s homeless people hold regular jobs. These are people who lack neither will nor ability. Lucien's argument against the publichousing advocates' position is most vulnerable to which one of the following criticisms? A: It fails to address the issue, raised by the publichousing advocates' argument, of who would pay for the construction of more lowincome housing. B: It overlooks the possibility that not all apartment buildings have vacant apartments for rent. C: It offers no justification for dismissing as absurd the housing advocates' claim that there are many homeless people in the city.

Which one of the following judgments best illustrates the principle illustrated by the argument above? A: Ramirez was forced by the discovery of new evidence to admit that she lied about her role in managing the chief of staff 's financial affairs. Nevertheless, the board of directors cannot justifiably take action against Ramirez, because in past instances it has pardoned others guilty of similar improprieties.

The two sets of tracks make abrupt turns repeatedly in tandem, suggesting that the predator was following the grazing dinosaur and had matched its stride. Modern predatory mammals, such as lions, usually match the stride of prey they are chasing immediately before they strike those prey. This suggests that the predatory dinosaur was chasing the grazing dinosaur and attacked immediately afterwards. Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the argument by the statement that the predatory dinosaur was following the grazing dinosaur and had matched its stride? A: It is presented to counteract a possible objection to the argument's overall conclusion. B: It provides the basis for an analogy used in support of the argument's overall conclusion.

A: If a species is highly adaptable, it will thrive when introduced into a new environment. If a species thrives in its new environment, it will have an adverse effect on species already existing in that environment. But, since this species has not had an adverse effect on any species already existing in its new environment, it is not highly adaptable.

Opponents of closer runways claim that the number is closer to 1 in 20, 000, but this figure is based on a partial review of air traffic control tapes and so is relatively unreliable compared to the other figure, which is based on a thorough study of the flight reports required of pilots for all commercial flights. Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the airport administrator's argument? A: The argument questions the integrity of those who are opposed to allowing runways to be built closer together. B: The argument presumes, without providing justification, that the air traffic control tapes studied do not provide accurate information concerning specific flights. C: The argument overlooks the fact that those who make mistakes are often unreliable sources of information about those mistakes. D: The argument presumes, without providing justification, that building runways closer together will encourage pilots to be more cautious while landing.

These legal restrictions, they complain, are too mechanical and prevent judges from deciding when a given individual can or cannot be rehabilitated. But that is precisely why mandatory minimum sentences are necessary. History amply demonstrates that when people are free to use their own judgment they invariably believe themselves to act wisely when in fact they are often arbitrary and irrational. There is no reason to think that judges are an exception to this rule. Which one of the following sentences most accurately expresses the main point of the passage? A: Mandatory minimum sentences are too mechanical and reduce judicial discretion. B: Mandatory minimum sentences are needed to help prevent judicial arbitrariness. C: People believe that they have good judgment but never do. D: Judges should be free to exercise their own judgment.

However, the library's own studies show that fewer than 10% of town residents use the library. The city council claims that the library is underutilized because the books, electronic media, and computer equipment are outdated, and that if these were updated, more residents would use the library. However, the last time the town allocated additional funding to the library, usage of the library did not increase. Ttherefore the town should not allocate additional funding for the library. Which of the following most seriously weakens the mayor's argument? A: Many of the patrons who do use the library are dissatisfied with the library's resources.

Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends? A: The total amount of writing paper manufactured worldwide will increase significantly in the future. B: Certain kinds of paper cannot be manufactured from recycled paper. C: Beyond a certain limit, increasing the amount of filler added to paper pulp does not increase the whiteness of the paper made from the pulp.

Nevertheless, experts reject the claim that turning Hevelia into a fullservice airport would end the chronic delays at Greentown. Which of the following, if true, most helps to justify experts' position? A: A second largely undeveloped airstrip close to Greentown airport would be a more attractive alternative than Hevelia for many passengers who now use Greentown.

Which one of the following principles, if established, would provide the strongest backing for the argument? A: Whenever most practitioners of a given discipline approach a particular problem in the same way, that uniformity is good evidence that all similar problems should also be approached in that way. B: Whenever psychologists agree that a single psychology is inadequate for two distinct age groups, they should be prepared to show that there are greater differences between the two age groups than there are between individuals in the same age group. C: Whenever two groups of people are so related to each other that any member of the second group must previously have been a member of the first, people in the first group should not be regarded simply as deviant members of the second group.

These costs necessitate reliance on large corporate sponsors, who in return demand that only the most famous operas be produced. Determining which operas will be produced should rest only with ticket purchasers at the box office, not with large corporate sponsors. If we reduce production budgets so that operas can be supported exclusively by boxoffice receipts and donations from individuals, then the public will be able to see less famous operas. Which one of the following, if true, would weaken the argument? A: A few opera ticket purchasers go to the opera for the sake of going to the opera, not to see specific operatic productions. B: The reduction of opera production budgets would not reduce the desire of large corporate sponsors to support operas. C: Large corporate sponsors will stop supporting opera productions if they are denied control over which operas will be produced. D: Without the support of large corporate sponsors, opera companies could not afford to produce any but the most famous of operas.

A comparison of this top layer with the underlying 150 centimeters of soil accumulated over 80, 000 years reveals that before humans arrived on Tiliga, a much larger and more diverse population of birds lived there. Thus, the arrival of humans dramatically decreased the population and diversity of birds on Tiliga. Which one of the following statements, if true, most seriously weakens the argument? A: Many of the bird species that disappeared from Tiliga did not disappear from other, similar, uninhabited islands until much later.

Styrene, a carcinogenic byproduct, is generated in foam production, and foam cups, once used, persist indefinitely in the environment. Tina: You overlook the environmental effects of paper cups. A study done 5 years ago showed that making paper for their production burned more petroleum than was used for foam cups and used 12 times as much steam, 36 times as much electricity, and twice as much cooling water. Because paper cups weigh more, their transportation takes more energy. Paper mills produce water pollution, and when the cups decay they produce methane, a gas that contributes to harmful global warming. So they are a worse choice. Which one of the following, if true, could Mark cite to counter evidence offered by Tina? A: The production and transportation of petroleum occasions serious environmental pollution, but the energy that runs paper mills now comes from burning waste wood rather than petroleum. B: The use of energy for chain saws that cut down trees and for trucks that haul logs is part of the environmental cost of manufacturing paper. C: Foam cups are somewhat more acceptable to consumers than paper cups because of their better insulating qualities.

During heavy sunspot activity, there is a sharp rise in positively charged ions in the air people breathe, and positively charged ions are known to make people anxious and irritable. Ttherefore, it is likely that sunspot activity has actually been a factor in triggering popular uprisings. Which one of the following exhibits a pattern of reasoning most similar to that in the passage? A: The ancient Greeks sometimes attempted to predict the outcome of future events by watching the flight patterns of birds. Since the events themselves often matched the predictions, the birds were probably responding to some factor that also influenced the events.

In fact, trying to sell such an item fast by asking too low a price is a serious error, since it calls into question the very thing exclusivity that is supposed to be the item' s chief appeal. Ttherefore, given that a price that will prove to be right is virtually impossible for the seller to gauge in advance, the seller should make sure that any error in the initial asking price is in the direction of setting the price too high. The argument recommends a certain pricing strategy on the grounds that A: the error associated with this strategy, unlike the error associated with the rejected alternative, is likely to go unnoticed B: this strategy has all of the advantages of the rejected alternative, but fewer of its disadvantages C: experience has proven this strategy to be superior, even though the reasons for this superiority elude analysis D: this strategy lacks a counterproductive feature of the rejected alternative Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"D"},{"prompt":"an: There is no direct evidence that timber was traded between the ancient nations of Poran and Nayal, but the fact that a law setting tariffs on timber imports from Poran was enacted during the third Nayalese dynasty does suggest that during that period a timber trade was conducted. Critic: Your reasoning is flawed. During its third dynasty, Nayal may well have imported timber from Poran, but certainly on today' s statute books there remain many laws regulating activities that were once common but in which people no longer engage. The critic's response to the historian's reasoning does which one of the following? A: It distinguishes between what has been established as a certainty and what has been established as a possibility. B: It identifies a general principle that the historian's reasoning violates. C: It establishes explicit criteria that must be used in evaluating indirect evidence. D: It implies an analogy between the present and the past.

This is a very wasteful practice because many, if not most, of the rejected fish do not survive. Fishing permits should ttherefore be altered so that fishers can keep fish caught accidentally. Amar: Making it legal to keep those fish would probably lead to a lot more accidents. The technique Amar uses in responding to Sarah's argument is to A: contend that Sarah's recommendation has an important negative consequence B: maintain that Sarah overlooks important lessons from past policies C: allude to a factor that supposedly strengthens the case for Sarah's recommendation D: point out that Sarah used a crucial term in two distinct senses Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"A"},{"prompt":"Several industries have recently switched at least partly from older technologies powered by fossil fuels to new technologies powered by electricity. It is thus evident that less fossil fuel is being used as a result of the operations of these industries than would have been used if these industries had retained their older technologies. Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument above? A: Less fossil fuel was used to manufacture the machinery employed in the new technologies than was originally used to manufacture the machinery employed in the older technologies. B: Some of the industries that have switched at least partly to the new technologies still use primarily technologies that are powered by fossil fuels. C: The amount of fossil fuel used to generate the electricity needed to power the new technologies is less than the amount that would have been used to power the older technologies.

But this does not require that animals perfectly recall every detail of all their experiences. Instead, to function well, memory should generalize from past experiences that are similar to the current one. The neuroscientist's statements, if true, most strongly support which of the following conclusions? A: Generalizing from past experiences requires clear memories of most if not all the details of those experiences. B: Recalling every detail of all past experiences would be incompatible with any ability to generalize from those experiences. C: Animals can often react more appropriately than they otherwise would to situations they encounter if they draw on generalizations from past experiences of similar situations. D: At least some animals perfectly recall every detail of at least some past experiences.

Its arguments are based on a complete misunderstanding of the operation of pure chance in nature and so it fails as a critique of finalism. Finalism, ttherefore, is clearly more plausible than people have thought. Which one of the following is most closely parallel in its flawed reasoning to the flawed reasoning in the reviewer's argument? A: Few botanists deny that a recently discovered fern is the same species represented in ancient fossils. The botanists who first discovered this specimen deny that it is the same species as the ancient one, but they have spent little time studying the specimen. Ttherefore, the specimen is likely to be the same species represented in the ancient fossils. B: No literary historian still believes the claim that a single author wrote every word of this collection of works. Evidence on which that claim is based can be shown to be false by manuscript dating techniques, but these dating results have not been cited before. Ttherefore, it is quite likely that a single author did write every word of this collection of works. C: Bicycle engineers no longer believe that aluminum is as good a frame material as titanium. An engineer at Ace Bicycles has argued that aluminum is not as good as titanium because it breaks under pressure. But he is confused about the kind of pressure exerted on bicycles. Ttherefore, the claim that aluminum is as good a frame material as titanium makes more sense than bicycle engineers believe. D: Experts agree that red wines from France's Bordeaux region are the best in the world, and five are on this year's list of the world's top ten red wines.

This is so because the statements reported by such journalists are dissociated from the precise circumstances in which they were made and thus will be accepted for publication only if the statements are high in plausibility or originality or interest to a given audience precisely the properties of a good anecdote. Student: But what you are saying, then, is that the journalist need not bother with sources in the first place. Surely, any reasonably resourceful journalist can invent plausible, original, or interesting stories faster than they can be obtained from unidentified sources. The student's response contains which one of the following reasoning flaws? A: confusing a marginal journalistic practice with the primary work done by journalists B: ignoring the possibility that the teacher regards as a prerequisite for the publication of an unattributed statement that the statement have actually been made C: judging the merits of the teacher's position solely by the most extreme case to which the position applies D: confusing the characteristics of reported statements with the characteristics of the situations in which the statements were made Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"B"},{"prompt":"Criminologist: Those who propose a rule mandating a life sentence for any criminal who has multiple convictions for serious crimes argue that it would be a welcome crackdown on career criminals.

Each of the following, if true, supports the claim above EXCEPT: A: The priorities of local police departments, under whose jurisdiction most computer crime falls, are weighted toward visible street crime that communities perceive as threatening. B: Computer criminals have rarely been sentenced to serve time in prison, because prisons are overcrowded with violent criminals and drug offenders. C: The preparation of computerfraud cases takes much more time than is required for average fraud cases, and the productivity of prosecutors is evaluated by the number of good cases made. D: The many police officers who are untrained in computers often inadvertently destroy the physical evidence of computer crime.

Given how influential these media are, we have good reason to believe that these depictions cause young people to engage in violent behavior. Hence, depictions of violence among teenagers should be prohibited from movies and television programs, if only in those programs and movies promoted to young audiences. Maurice: But you are recommending nothing short of censorship! Besides which, your claim that television and movie depictions of violence cause violence is mistaken: violence among young people predates movies and television by centuries. Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens Jane's argument? A: Many adolescents who engage in violent behavior had already displayed such behavior before they were exposed violence in movies. B: The movies that have been shown to have the most influence on young people's behavior are those that are promoted to young audiences. C: The people who make the most profits in the movie and television industry are those who can successfully promote their work to both young and old audiences.

Etiquette does not necessarily even oppose the expression of offensive ideas. Rather, it dictates that there are situations in which the expression of potentially offensive, disturbing, or controversial ideas is inappropriate and that, where appropriate, the expression and discussion of such ideas is to be done in a civil manner. Which one of the following judgments most closely corresponds to the principles of etiquette stated above? A: The journalists at a news conference should not ask a politician potentially embarrassing questions about a controversial policy issue. B: The moderator of a panel discussion of a divisive moral issue should not allow participants to engage in namecalling.

Although such abnormalities often can be corrected by surgery, the cost can reach several thousand dollars. Since nonpurebred dogs rarely suffer from genetically determined abnormalities, potential dog owners who want to reduce the risk of incurring costly medical bills for their pets would be well advised to choose nonpurebred dogs. Which one of the following if true, most seriously weakens the argument? A: All dogs, whether purebred or nonpurebred, are subject to the same common nongenetically determined diseases. B: A dog that does not have genetically determined abnormalities may nevertheless have offspring with such abnormalities. C: The purchase price of nonpurebred dogs tends to be lower than the purchase price of purebred dogs.

Yet most migrant workers work long hours each day for eleven or twelve months a year and thus are as much fulltime workers as are people hired on a yearround basis. Ttherefore, the law should require that migrant workers be paid the same minimum hourly wage that other fulltime workers must be paid. The pattern of reasoning displayed above most closely parallels that displayed in which one of the following arguments? A: Because food additives are not considered drugs, they have not had to meet the safety standards the government applies to drugs. But food additives can be as dangerous as drugs. Ttherefore, food additives should also be subject to safety regulations as stringent as those covering drugs. B: Because some countries regulate gun sales more strictly than do other countries, some people can readily purchase a gun, whereas others cannot. Ttherefore, all countries should cooperate in developing a uniform international policy regarding gun sales. C: Because it is a democratic principle that laws should have the consent of those affected by them, liquor laws should be formulated not by politicians but by club and restaurant owners, since such laws directly affect the profitability of their businesses. D: Because many rural areas have few restrictions on development, housing estates in such areas have been built where no adequate supply of safe drinking water could be ensured. Thus, rural areas should adopt building codes more like those large cities have.

A: The profits that a company makes in a given year are, in part, returned to the owners of the company. B: Managers who routinely donate a certain percentage of corporate profits to charity do so with the owners' tacit consent.

Which of the following, if true, argues most strongly against the ornithologists' speculation? A: The Aquipos toucan is also able to use its beak to break bark, thereby accessing insects that dwell in the trunk. B: Many insects crawl on the bark of the tree and a toucan can sometimes become satiated without having to access insects living beneath the bark. C: The tree holes in which the Aquipos toucan is able to access insects have a characteristic shape that differs only very slightly from tree to tree.

However, people' s actual spoken remarks rarely convey their ideas as clearly as does a distillation of those ideas crafted, after an interview, by a skilled writer. Ttherefore, since this practice avoids the more serious misrepresentation that would occur if people' s exact words were quoted but their ideas only partially expressed, it is entirely defensible. Which one of the following is a questionable technique used in the argument? A: claiming that the prestige of a profession provides ample grounds for dismissing criticisms of that profession B: answering an exaggerated charge by undermining the personal authority of those who made that charge C: concluding that a practice is right on the grounds that it is necessary D: offering as an adequate defense of a practice an observation that discredits only one of several possible alternatives to that practice Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"D"},{"prompt":"Linguist: In English, the past is described as behind and the future ahead, whereas in Aymara the past is ahead and the future behind.

Ttherefore the extensive ruins in the archaeological site at Kadshim are probably the remains of a largely uninhabited ceremonial structure rather than of a densely populated city, since the land in the region of Kadshim could never have supported any farms except mixed farms, which grow a variety of crops and livestock.

A: drawing a conclusion that is simply a restatement of one of the premises on which the argument is based B: taking the nonexistence of something as evidence that a necessary precondition for that thing also did not exist C: taking the fact that something is true of one sample of a class of things as evidence that the same is true of the entire class of things D: interpreting an ambiguous claim in one way in one part of the argument and in another way in another part of the argument Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"B"},{"prompt":"Letter to the editor: I have never seen such flawed reasoning and distorted evidence as that which you tried to pass off as a balanced study in the article Speed Limits, Fatalities, and Public Policy. The article states that areas with lower speed limits had lower vehiclerelated fatality rates than other areas. However, that will not be true for long, since vehiclerelated fatality rates are rising in the areas with lower speed limits. So the evidence actually supports the view that speed limits should be increased. The reasoning in the letter writer's argument is flawed because the argument A: does not present any claims as evidence against the opposing viewpoint B: bases its conclusion on findings from the same article that it is criticizing C: fails to consider the possibility that the vehiclerelated fatality rates in other areas are also rising D: fails to consider the possibility that automobile accidents that occur at high speeds often result in fatalities Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"C"},{"prompt":"is widely believed that eating chocolate can cause acne. Indeed, many people who are susceptible to acne report that, in their own experience, eating large amounts of chocolate is invariably followed by an outbreak of that skin condition. However, it is likely that common wisdom has mistaken an effect for a cause. Several recent scientific studies indicate that hormonal changes associated with stress can cause acne and there is good evidence that people who are fond of chocolate tend to eat more chocolate when they are under stress. Of the following, which one most accurately expresses the main point of the argument? A: People are mistaken who insist that whenever they eat large amounts of chocolate they invariably suffer from an outbreak of acne, B: Eating large amounts of chocolate is more likely to cause stress than it is to cause outbreaks of acne. C: The more chocolate a person eats, the more likely that person is to experience the hormonal changes associated with stress.

That plan is illconceived: if the farmers did sell their land, they would sell it to the highest bidder, and developers would outbid any other bidders. On the other hand, <b> these farmers will never actually sell any of the land, provided that farming it remains viable </b>. But farming will not remain viable if the farms are left unmodernized, and most of the farmers lack the financial resources modernization requires. And that is exactly why a more sensible preservation strategy would be to assist the farmers to modernize their farms to the extent needed to maintain viability. In the argument as a whole, the two boldface proportions play which of the following roles? A: The first presents a goal, strategies for achieving which are being evaluated in the argument; the second is a judgment providing a basis for the argument's advocacy of a particular strategy. B: The first presents a goal that the argument concludes cannot be attained; the second is a reason offered in support of that conclusion. C: The first presents a goal that the argument concludes can be attained; the second is a judgment disputing that conclusion.
