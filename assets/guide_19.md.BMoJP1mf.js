However, this trend continued well into the late 19th century. Between 1860 and 1880, there was a further increase in grain dependence as a result of several factors. One of the main contributors to this was the development of new technologies such as the reaper and thresher, which made farming more efficient and increased yields. Additionally, the expansion of railroads allowed farmers to transport their goods over greater distances and reach more markets. Another factor that contributed to increased grain dependence during this period was the growth of the milling industry. Flour mills became more centralized and efficient, allowing for greater production and distribution of flour and other grain products. While it is difficult to compare the exact rates of increase in grain dependence between these two time periods, it is clear that the trend continued and even accelerated between 1860 and 1880.

The decision has sparked fury from the father of the schoolboy who was killed by the brothers in a brutal attack in 2008. The Preddie brothers, Ricky and Danny, were convicted of manslaughter for the death of Damilola Taylor, a 10-year-old boy who was attacked on his way home from school in London. The brothers, aged 13 and 12 at the time of the attack, were sentenced to eight years in prison for the crime. The decision to release Ricky Preddie after just five years has angered the father of Damilola Taylor, who referred to the Preddie brothers as \\"heinous child killers\\". He expressed his disappointment with the justice system, stating that this decision sends a message that young offenders can commit crimes and be back on the streets in no time. The release of the Preddie brothers has sparked debates about the effectiveness of the justice system in dealing with juvenile offenders. While some argue that the brothers were children at the time of the crime and should have been rehabilitated, others argue that the severity of the crime warranted a harsher sentence. The case of Damilola Taylor is a tragic reminder of the impact of violent crimes on families and communities. The release of Ricky Preddie has undoubtedly reopened wounds for the family of Damilola and raises questions about the effectiveness of the justice system in addressing such crimes. While the Preddie brothers may have served their time in prison, the damage caused by their actions will remain with the family and community forever.

The company is the biggest corporate backer of the Lib Dems, donating £777,000 since the General Election in 2010. The company is owned by tycoon Rumi Verjee who founded Domino's Pizza franchise in Britain.","completion":"Former Conservative cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell has come under fire for accepting £11,000 in donations from Brompton Capital, a company owned by tycoon Rumi Verjee. Brompton Capital is based in the tax haven of Jersey and has donated a total of £777,000 to the Liberal Democrats since the 2010 General Election. Verjee is a former donor to the Labour Party who founded the Domino's Pizza franchise in Britain. He is known for his business interests, which stretch across a range of sectors including property, hotels and energy. Critics of the donations argue that they highlight the murky relationship between politics and the business world. Some have accused Verjee and Brompton Capital of attempting to buy influence with the Liberal Democrats, who were in coalition with the Conservatives at the time of the donations. The controversy surrounding the donations has also raised questions about the role of tax havens in modern business. Jersey, where Brompton Capital is based, is one of several offshore jurisdictions used by companies and individuals to reduce their tax bills. Critics argue that such practices are unfair and deprive governments of much-needed revenue that could be used to fund public services. The issue of tax avoidance has become a major topic in recent years, with campaigners calling for greater transparency and action to clamp down on those who use tax havens to avoid paying their fair share. The controversy surrounding Andrew Mitchell's acceptance of donations from Brompton Capital is likely to fuel calls for reform in this area. Overall, the story highlights the complex relationship between politics, business and taxation. While political donations are legal, the use of tax havens by companies to reduce their tax bills remains a highly controversial issue.

Medical professionals must balance concerns over patient safety and the prevention of preventable harm while also promoting patient autonomy and wellbeing.

This may be a very acceptable trade off for a light bulb that is in a difficulttoaccess location (for example, traffic lights or fixtures hung from high ceilings). Longlife bulbs take advantage of this tradeoff.

The objective is to minimize the cost of light, not the cost of lamps. Early bulbs had a life of up to 2500 hours, but in 1924 a cartel agreed to limit life to 1000 hours. When this was exposed in 1953, General Electric and other leading American manufacturers were banned from limiting the life.

The bombilla, a metal straw with a filter at the end, is used to extract the tea directly from the gourd, preserving its flavor and nutrient properties. Choosing a gourd can be a personal decision. There are many shapes and sizes available, ranging from simple and classic to elaborate and ornate. Gourds are typically made of natural materials such as wood, bamboo, or animal horns. It's important to select a gourd that's been correctly cured and dried to avoid any mold or unpleasant flavors. A well-maintained gourd can last for years, becoming a cherished item for any mate enthusiast. The bombilla is the companion of the gourd, and it's an essential part of enjoying yerba mate. The metal straw is typically made of stainless steel, brass, or nickel silver, and features a filter at the bottom. The filter allows for the liquid to pass through, while the leaves stay behind, providing a clean and smooth sip. Choosing a bombilla can also be a personal choice, with various models and designs on the market. Together, the gourd and bombilla create a communal experience. It's customary to share the yerba mate by passing the gourd and bombilla around a group of friends or family. This practice fosters social connections, promoting conversations, and creating a sense of bonding. Obtaining a gourd and bombilla is a simple process, and they can be found at specialty stores, markets, or online retailers.

Among the various battles and operations, the Likhi Range and Kataisi were key regions in the Soviet Union's strategy to secure its borders and gain tactical advantage. But which area did the Red Army go to second, Likhi Range or Kataisi? The answer is Likhi Range. After the Soviet Union joined the war in 1941, the German army rapidly advanced towards Moscow, posing a severe threat to the country's survival. In response, the Soviet forces organized a counter-offensive, known as the Battle of Moscow, which lasted from October 1941 to January 1942. The battle was a turning point in the war, as the Red Army managed to stop the German advance and force them to retreat. Once the Moscow front was stabilized, the Soviet command focused on other areas where the German forces were entrenched. One of those was the Likhi Range, a mountainous region in Georgia, which was strategically significant for its proximity to the oil-rich fields of Azerbaijan. In May 1942, the Red Army launched an offensive in the region, aiming to capture the strategic passes and deny the Germans access to the Caucasus. The fight for the Likhi Range was fierce and lasted for several months. The German army had fortified their positions, and the mountainous terrain made the Soviet advance slow and challenging. However, the Red Army managed to break through the enemy lines and successfully secured the passes by September 1942. The battle had a significant impact on the course of the war, as it allowed the Soviet Union to control the flow of oil from the Caucasus and deprived the Germans of a crucial resource. On the other hand, Kataisi, another Georgian region, was not a primary objective for the Red Army during that time. Although the area was occupied by the German forces, it did not possess the same strategic importance as the Likhi Range. The Soviet Union launched an offensive in the region in 1943, as part of the larger Operation Ring, which aimed to liberate North Ossetia and surrounding territories. However, the battle for Kataisi was relatively brief and did not have a significant impact on the war's outcome. In conclusion, the Likhi Range was the area that the Red Army went to second, after the successful defense of Moscow. The battle for the mountainous region was a challenging and vital operation for the Soviet Union, as it secured the access to the Caucasus' oil reserves and weakened the German army. Conversely, Kataisi was a secondary objective, and the battle for its liberation did not have a significant impact on the war's outcome."},{"prompt":"e writer has stated it, this surrender to her husband is a modest tribute to be paid for the present and future happiness of marriage and motherhood!

Public Fear and Resistance: Fear of being soft on crime and resistance from the public, especially those who have been victims of crime, can deter politicians from taking any action that appears to be soft on criminals, including prison reform. 3. Cost Considerations: Prison reform often requires significant financial resources to implement, and politicians may be less willing to allocate funding for such initiatives, especially in times of economic downturn. 4. Private Prison Lobbies: Private prison industries have powerful lobbies that influence government policies, making it difficult to pass reforms that could negatively impact their profits. 5.

However, blogger Elissa Strauss, who suffers from celiac disease, warns that gluten-free foods can come at a cost. Not only are they 242% more expensive than their gluten-containing counterparts, but they also often contain higher levels of fat. For those with celiac disease or gluten intolerances, avoiding gluten is necessary for maintaining good health. However, for those without gluten sensitivities, the trend towards gluten-free diets may not be worth the added cost and potential health concerns. Many people believe that cutting out gluten is a healthy choice, but this is not always the case. In fact, some gluten-free foods may contain more sugar and fat to make up for the lack of gluten. This can have negative consequences on a person's health, including weight gain and an increased risk of diabetes. Before jumping on the gluten-free bandwagon, it's important to consider the potential downsides. For those with gluten sensitivities, it may be worth the extra cost and effort to find suitable alternatives. However, for those without a medical need, it may be more beneficial to focus on a balanced and varied diet that includes gluten-containing foods. Ultimately, the decision to go gluten-free should be based on individual health needs and preferences. It's important to educate oneself on the potential benefits and drawbacks before making any drastic dietary changes."},{"prompt":"Add punctuation: Based on our longstanding collaboration NEPCon manages the Rainforest Alliances forestry programme in Europe Russia Turkey and Israel Were delivering FSC certification services in association with the Rainforest Alliance whilst we hold our own accreditation for PEFC chain of custody certification regno DANAK 7029","completion":"Based on our longstanding collaboration, NEPCon manages the Rainforest Alliance's forestry programme in Europe, Russia, Turkey, and Israel.

One option is to find a pre-made dune buggy that was already converted from a Type 1 Volkswagen Beetle. This route takes out the majority of the assembly work, allowing you to focus more on customizing the buggy to fit your personal style. Pre-made dune buggies are often found for sale on online marketplaces or at specialty car shops. If you want to build your dune buggy from the ground up and you need some guidance, you can also purchase a buggy kit. These kits provide all the necessary parts for building your own dune buggy and include detailed instructions on how to assemble them. Buggy kits are ideal for people who want to build their own buggy but don't have much experience in automotive work. If you're a more experienced builder and want to create your own customized dune buggy, you can also buy construction plans. Plans come with a detailed list of all the required parts and instructions on how to build your buggy from scratch. This option is great for people who want complete control over the build process and who want to create a buggy that is truly unique. Finally, for those who have some car building experience and want to source their own parts, it's possible to pay for individual parts separately to complete your dune buggy.

If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable. At extremely large airports, a circuit is in place but not usually used. Rather, aircraft (usually only commercial with long routes) request approach clearance while they are still hours away from the airport, often before they even take off from their departure point. Large airports have a frequency called Clearance Delivery which is used by departing aircraft specifically for this purpose. This then allows aircraft to take the most direct approach path to the runway and land without worrying about interference from other aircraft. While this system keeps the airspace free and is simpler for pilots, it requires detailed knowledge of how aircraft are planning to use the airport ahead of time and is therefore only possible with large commercial airliners on prescheduled flights. The system has recently become so advanced that controllers can predict whether an aircraft will be delayed on landing before it even takes off; that aircraft can then be delayed on the ground, rather than wasting expensive fuel waiting in the air.

It means that in order to be taken seriously and respected in your field, you must not only dress the part, but also conduct yourself in a manner that reflects competency and professionalism. In terms of dressing the part, this means dressing appropriately for your industry or job. For example, if you work in finance, you'll likely be expected to dress in business attire, such as a suit and tie. However, if you work in a creative field, you may have more leeway to express your personal style. Regardless of your industry, it's important to ensure that your appearance is neat and polished. This means making sure your clothes are clean and well-fitted, your hair is groomed, and your accessories are appropriate. However, dressing the part is only half of the equation. Acting the part also requires a certain level of professionalism and competence. This means being punctual, respectful, and communicating effectively with others. Additionally, it means being knowledgeable about your industry and being confident in your abilities. Continuously expanding your knowledge and skills through education and networking opportunities can help you feel more confident in your abilities and act the part more effectively. Ultimately, \\"look the part. Act the part\\" is a reminder that in order to succeed in your professional life, you must present yourself in a way that commands respect and reflects your knowledge and abilities.

During his reign, he expanded his territory and consolidated his power through military conquests and political alliances. While there is evidence of Ivan III ordering the burning of cities during his military campaigns, it is difficult to determine the exact number of cities he burned. One notable instance of Ivan III burning a city is during his campaign against the city of Novgorod in 1478-1479. After a lengthy siege, Ivan III captured the city and ordered it to be burned as punishment for their defiance. It is said that around 60,000 people were killed during the siege and subsequent burning of Novgorod. Another example of Ivan III ordering the burning of a city was during his campaign against the Tatar Khanate of Kazan in 1487. After defeating the Tatar forces, Ivan III ordered the city of Kazan to be burned and its people enslaved. There are also reports of Ivan III ordering the burning of smaller towns and villages during his various campaigns. However, due to the lack of reliable historical records from the time, it is difficult to determine the exact number of cities Ivan III burned. In conclusion, while there are examples of Ivan III ordering the burning of cities during his military campaigns, it is not possible to determine the exact number of cities he burned. What is clear, however, is that Ivan III was a formidable ruler who was willing to use extreme measures to consolidate his power and expand his territory."},{"prompt":"Question: Who invaded the Archaemenid Empire in 334BC?

Getting a good haircut can save you time and effort in the mornings. It is essential to talk to your stylist and communicate your preferences.

Using the right products for your hair is essential to maintain your hairstyle. Different hair types need different products, so it is essential to choose wisely.

Don’t eat too much at night. Avoid exercising too close to bedtime. Limit naps. Monitor your lighting conditions, particularly late in the day.","completion":"Tips for Better Sleep: Avoid Stimulants, Late-Night Eating, Exercise, and Excessive Lighting Do you struggle to fall asleep or stay asleep throughout the night? If so, you're not alone. Many people experience sleep difficulties due to a variety of factors, including lifestyle habits. In this article, we will explore some simple tips to help improve your sleep. First, it's important to avoid stimulants and depressants, especially in the evening hours. Stimulants like caffeine or nicotine can keep you awake, while depressants like alcohol or sedatives can disrupt your sleep quality. Instead, opt for calming activities like reading or meditation to help you wind down at night. Another factor to consider is late-night eating. Eating too much or too late can cause digestive discomfort that may interfere with sleep. To avoid this, try to finish your meals at least two to three hours before bedtime. Exercise is an excellent way to boost overall health, but it's best to avoid exercising too close to bedtime. This is because exercise increases heart rate, body temperature, and adrenaline, which can make it difficult to calm down and fall asleep. Instead, try exercising in the morning or afternoon, which can help to promote better sleep at night. If you're someone who enjoys napping, it's important to limit your naps to 20-30 minutes. Napping for longer periods can disrupt your sleep cycle and leave you feeling groggy or fatigued upon waking. Lastly, pay attention to your lighting conditions, particularly late in the day. Too much light exposure can suppress the production of the sleep hormone melatonin, making it harder to fall asleep. Consider dimming the lights or wearing blue-light-blocking glasses to reduce exposure to sleep-disrupting light. Overall, making small changes to your daily routine can have a big impact on your sleep quality. By avoiding stimulants and depressants, limiting late-night eating, avoiding exercising too close to bedtime, limiting naps, and monitoring your lighting conditions, you can promote a more restful, restorative night's sleep."},{"prompt":"Write an article using the following points: Dave Matthews says he was nervous about displaying his art in a New York exhibit.

It requires discipline, commitment, and support. However, it's vital to take the first step towards a healthier lifestyle. Here are five steps to help you quit an addictive habit: 1. Set a Date to Quit: Consistency is key when quitting an addiction. Set a date to start and be accountable to it. Write it down and stick it somewhere visible. This will help you stay motivated and focused on your goal. 2. Seek Personal and Professional Support: It's tough to do this on your own. Find someone you can confide in, someone who can become your accountability partner. Additionally, professional help can be beneficial. Consider attending support groups or seeking professional counselling. 3. Identify Your Triggers: Understanding what triggers your addictive behaviour is a game-changer. Create a list of situations, people, or emotions that make you indulge in the addiction. This will help you figure out how to avoid them or find alternative ways to cope with the triggers. 4. Start Ramping Down Your Addictive Habit: Trying to quit abruptly can frustrate your efforts. Instead, gradually reduce your addictive behaviour. For example, if it's smoking, reduce the number of cigarettes you smoke each day or reduce the times you smoke in a day. 5. Get Your Environment Ready: A supportive environment is critical when quitting any addiction. Clear your space of anything that can tempt you. Get rid of substances, delete numbers of people who are not supportive, and look for more healthy activities to engage in. In summary, quitting an addiction is a challenging but rewarding journey. Remember to set a date, seek support, identify your triggers, ramp down gradually, and set up a supportive environment. Stay accountable, celebrate your small wins, and seek help when needed.

The first thing to consider is your running shoes. It’s important to choose a pair that fits well and feels comfortable on your feet. Look for shoes that offer support and cushioning to reduce the impact on your joints. Not sure which shoes to choose? Visit a specialty running store where the staff can analyze your gait and suggest shoes that are best suited for your running style. Once you have a good pair of shoes, be sure to replace them every 350–500 miles (560–800 km). Over time, the cushioning and support in your shoes will break down, which can lead to pain or even injury if you continue to run in them. To keep track of your mileage, use a running app or keep a logbook. Next, dress appropriately for the weather. If it’s hot out, wear lightweight, breathable clothing that wicks away sweat. On colder days, layer up with moisture-wicking fabrics and consider adding a hat and gloves to keep your extremities warm. Staying hydrated is also key to a successful run. Grab a water bottle and take sips of water throughout your run to keep your body hydrated. If you’re running for longer distances, consider bringing a hydration pack or planning a route that passes water fountains. Finally, don’t forget to bring along any accessories you need. A running belt or pouch can hold your phone, keys, and any other small items you might need during your run. Be sure to choose a belt that fits snugly and won’t bounce around as you run.

During this period, two major additions were made to the castle, the massive Vladislav Hall and the new defense towers on the north side. However, the question of which was added second during the rebuilding is a matter of debate among historians. Some argue that the Vladislav Hall was added first, while others believe that the defense towers were added before the hall. One argument in favor of the defense towers being added second is that they were built primarily as a response to new military technologies that emerged during the latter half of the 15th century. These technologies included the use of gunpowder and artillery, which made traditional castle walls and defenses obsolete. As a result, the construction of new defense towers on the north side of the castle would have been a logical response to these advancements in military technology. On the other hand, Vladislav Hall was a grand ceremonial hall with a capacity of over 900 people. It was built to impress foreign dignitaries and serve as the centerpiece of the castle's social life. It's possible that King Vladislav II prioritized the construction of this impressive hall over the defense towers. Ultimately, the question of which was added second during the rebuilding of Prague Castle may never be definitively answered. Both the Vladislav Hall and the defense towers were important additions to the castle, and their construction played a significant role in shaping the castle's history and legacy."},{"prompt":"As we were in line these girls who must have been about 10 years old asked me if I was planning on wearing the clothing I was currently wearing .
