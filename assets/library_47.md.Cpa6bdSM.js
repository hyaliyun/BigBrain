This new function can add new functionality to the original function, or modify the behavior of the original function, without requiring you to modify the original function itself. You can apply the decorator to a function by using the \\"@\\" symbol followed by the name of the decorator function immediately before the original function definition. Here is an example: \`\`\` def my_decorator(func): def wrapper(): print(\\"Before the function is called.\\") func() print(\\"After the function is called.\\") return wrapper @my_decorator def say_hello(): print(\\"Hello!\\") say_hello() \`\`\` This code defines a decorator function called \`my_decorator\`, which takes a function as input and returns a new function called \`wrapper\`. The \`wrapper\` function adds some new functionality to the original function, in this case printing a message before and after the function is called. The \`@my_decorator\` syntax applies the \`my_decorator\` decorator to the \`say_hello\` function, modifying its behavior. When you run this code, it prints: \`\`\` Before the function is called. Hello! After the function is called. \`\`\`"},{"prompt":"w do you convert kilograms to pounds?","completion":"To convert kilograms to pounds, multiply the number of kilograms by 2.20462."},{"prompt":"Extract the names of all the European countries mentioned in the paragraph.

During photosynthesis, carbon dioxide from the air enters the plant through small pores called stomata. Water is absorbed by the plant's roots and transported to the leaves. Inside the plant cell, chloroplasts containing chlorophyll capture light energy from the sun. This light energy is used to split water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen ions. The oxygen is released into the atmosphere, while the hydrogen ions are used to create energy-rich molecules called ATP and NADPH. The carbon dioxide then enters the plant cell, where it is combined with the hydrogen ions, ATP, and NADPH to create glucose. This glucose is either used immediately by the plant as an energy source or converted into a more complex carbohydrate, like starch or cellulose, for storage. Overall, photosynthesis serves as a primary source of energy for most living organisms on Earth and plays a crucial role in our planet's carbon cycle."},{"prompt":"w can companies avoid perpetuating stereotypes in their marketing?","completion":"Companies can avoid perpetuating stereotypes in their marketing by ensuring that they accurately represent the diversity of their customers, avoiding gendered language and imagery, challenging traditional gender roles, and critically examining their messaging for unconscious biases."},{"prompt":"List the planets of our solar system in order from closest to the sun to farthest from the sun.","completion":"Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune."},{"prompt":"Make a list of glutenfree foods to stock up on for a celiac patient.","completion":"gluten-free grains (rice, quinoa, corn, millet, etc.), fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, eggs, meats, fish/seafood, beans, lentils, and gluten-free bread/pasta/flour.

While it has connected people and made communication easier, it has also led to various negative effects. One effect of social media on relationships is the erosion of privacy. Couples share their intimate moments on social media, which can lead to unintended consequences. For example, pictures and posts can create misunderstandings and jealousy, leading to fights and even breakups. Another effect is the prevalence of cyberbullying and trolling. Social media has made it easier to harass and belittle others anonymously, which can cause emotional pain and damage relationships. Couples may also become overly dependent on social media for validation, leading to unrealistic expectations and dissatisfaction with their relationships. Social media has also created new avenues for infidelity. With the ability to effortlessly connect with people outside of their existing relationships, social media platforms have become a breeding ground for cheating. This can destroy trust and communication between partners and ultimately lead to the demise of the relationship. Finally, social media has also made it easier for people to hide their true identities, leading to deception and dishonesty. People can create fake profiles, lie about their age, appearance, and interests, and manipulate others for their own gain. In conclusion, while social media has brought great benefits to modern relationships, it has also brought about negative effects. Privacy erosion, cyberbullying, infidelity, and dishonesty are just some of the issues couples face when navigating social media. It is important for couples to set healthy boundaries and communicate openly and honestly to ensure that social media doesn't damage their relationships."},{"prompt":"List all the main characters in Pride and Prejudice.","completion":"1.

Choose your yarn and needles. For beginners, it is recommended to use a medium weight yarn (also known as worsted weight) and size 8 or 9 knitting needles. 2. Make a slipknot and cast on stitches. To do this, make a small loop with the yarn and pull the end through the loop to create a knot. Then insert the needle through the loop and tighten the knot. Cast on the desired number of stitches (usually between 20-40). There are different methods to cast on stitches, but the most common is the long tail cast on. 3. Begin knitting. Hold the needle with the stitches on your left hand and insert the empty needle into the first stitch from left to right. Wrap the yarn counterclockwise around the right needle and pull it through the first stitch. Slip the original stitch off the left needle and repeat this process across the entire row. 4. Continue knitting rows. Once you reach the end of the first row, switch the position of the needles and repeat the process. Continue knitting rows until the scarf reaches the desired length. To create a neat edge, knit the first stitch of each row and slip the last stitch of each row purlwise without knitting it. 5. Bind off stitches. Once the scarf is at your desired length, bind off the stitches. To do this, knit the first two stitches of the row as normal, then use the left-hand needle to lift the first stitch over the second stitch and off the needle. Knit another stitch and repeat the process of lifting the previous stitch over the new one until you reach the end of the row. Cut the yarn after the last stitch, leaving a tail of a few inches. 6. Weave in ends. Thread the tail of yarn through a darning needle and weave it back and forth several times through the stitches of the last row. Cut any excess yarn. Congratulations! You have now knitted a basic scarf. Happy knitting!"},{"prompt":"Write a knock knock joke about pineapples.","completion":"Knock knock. Who's there? Pineapple. Pineapple who?

Reduces stress: One of the most significant benefits of meditation is its ability to reduce stress. By focusing on your breath and being present in the moment, you can let go of negative thoughts and emotions, leading to decreased feelings of anxiety and stress. 2. Increases focus: Meditation can help you improve your focus and concentration. It trains your brain to stay in the present moment and avoid distractions, leading to increased productivity and better decision-making. 3. Improves sleep: If you struggle to fall asleep or stay asleep, meditation may be a helpful tool. By relaxing your mind and body, you may find it easier to drift off into a peaceful sleep. 4. Boosts immunity: Stress weakens the immune system, so by reducing stress through meditation, you may help strengthen your overall immune function. 5. Promotes mindfulness: Meditation can help you become more mindful and aware of your thoughts, feelings, and surroundings. This heightened level of awareness can help you develop greater empathy and compassion towards others. Tips for Guided Meditation 1. Find a quiet space: Choose a quiet space where you won't be disturbed. You can sit on a comfortable chair or a cushion on the floor, whichever is more comfortable for you. 2. Set a timer: Start with a short meditation time, around 5-10 minutes, and gradually increase the time as you become more comfortable with the practice. Use a timer to ensure you don't get distracted. 3. Focus on your breath: Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths. Focus on the sensation of your breath as it enters and leaves your body. Don't worry if your mind wanders; gently bring your focus back to your breath. 4. Use guided meditations: Guided meditations are a great way to start, as they can help you stay focused and provide guidance on what to do if your mind wanders. You can download guided meditation apps or follow along with videos online. 5. Be consistent: As with any practice, consistency is key. Try to meditate at the same time every day, so it becomes a habit. In conclusion, meditation is a powerful tool that can help improve your overall well-being.

Wind energy: Wind turbines convert the kinetic energy of wind into electricity. Modern wind turbines have three blades and use a rotor to capture the energy of the wind. As the wind turns the blades, a generator within the turbine converts the rotational energy into usable electricity. 3. Hydro energy: Hydroelectric power plants use the force of moving water, typically from dams or rivers, to turn a turbine that generates electricity. The kinetic energy of the water spins blades on a turbine, which in turn drives a generator to produce electricity."},{"prompt":"Find the error in the sentence: Their going to the store later.","completion":"The error in the sentence is the incorrect use of the word \\"their.\\" It should be replaced with \\"they're,\\" which is a contraction of \\"they are.\\" The sentence should be written as: \\"They're going to the store later.\\""},{"prompt":"Compare and contrast two different music genres.","completion":"Task: Compare and Contrast Two Different Music Genres Comparison: Both hip hop and classical music are forms of music that elicit strong emotional responses from listeners.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) enters the chloroplasts through small pores called stomata and combines with a five-carbon sugar called ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) in a process called carbon fixation. 5. The six-carbon molecule resulting from this reaction splits into two three-carbon molecules of 3-phosphoglyceric acid (PGA) using energy from ATP and NADPH generated in the light-dependent reactions. 6. The 3-phosphoglyceric acids are converted into molecules of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) through a series of reactions called the Calvin cycle. 7.

This dietary trend primarily consists of consuming food derived from plants, such as vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, and seeds, while limiting or avoiding animal products such as meat, fish, eggs, and dairy. One of the main benefits of a plant-based diet is its positive impact on overall health. Research shows that plant-based diets can help lower the risks of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers. This is due to the naturally high fiber content of plants, which helps regulate blood sugar, prevent constipation, and lower cholesterol levels that can cause plaque buildup in arteries. Compared to an omnivorous diet, plant-based diets are also lower in calories and saturated fats, which can lead to weight loss and improved overall health. Additionally, consuming more plants may increase the intake of necessary vitamins and minerals such as magnesium, potassium, and vitamins C and E, as well as antioxidants that protect the body from free radicals. However, a plant-based diet also has potential drawbacks. One of these is the risk of nutrient deficiencies, particularly in vitamin B12, iron, calcium, and zinc. These nutrients are more readily available in animal products, and vegans or vegetarians may need to supplement or consume fortified plant-based foods to ensure adequate intake. Furthermore, plant-based diets can be more difficult to follow in certain social settings or cultures, as many traditional foods may include animal products. It can also require more time and effort to prepare plant-based meals that are nutritionally balanced, tasty, and satisfying. In conclusion, plant-based diets have numerous health benefits, including lower risks of chronic diseases and weight management. However, they may require more careful planning and attention to ensure adequate nutrient intake. As with any diet, it is important to consult with a healthcare practitioner to determine the best choice for individual health needs and lifestyles."},{"prompt":"What is the average salary for a software engineer in the United States?","completion":"The average salary for a software engineer in the United States is 107,510 per year."},{"prompt":"List three types of pasta.","completion":"Spaghetti, fettuccine, penne."},{"prompt":"Describe the difference between a crocodile and an alligator.","completion":"Crocodiles have a longer and V-shaped snout while alligators have a shorter and U-shaped snout.

The total value of his coins is 1.75. How many of each type of coin does Nate have?","completion":"Let x be the number of quarters and y be the number of dimes that Nate has. From the first sentence, we know that: x + y = 12 (equation 1) From the second sentence, we know that the total value of Nate's coins is 1.75, which can also be written as 175 cents: 25x + 10y = 175 (equation 2) Now we have two linear equations with two variables. We can solve for one variable in terms of the other in equation 1: x + y = 12 x = 12 - y Substitute this into equation 2: 25x + 10y = 175 25(12 - y) + 10y = 175 Simplify and solve for y: 300 - 15y = 175 -15y = -125 y = 8.33 This means that Nate has 8 dimes. We can use equation 1 to find the number of quarters: x + y = 12 x + 8.33 = 12 x = 3.67 This doesn't make sense as Nate can't have a fraction of a coin. Therefore, we made a mistake in our calculation. We made the assumption that Nate had at least one quarter and one dime, but this may not be the case. We can try another approach by substituting x = 12 - y into equation 2: 25x + 10y = 175 25(12 - y) + 10y = 175 300 - 15y = 175 -15y = -125 y = 8.33 This gives us the same result as before, but we can't have a fraction of a coin. Upon closer inspection, we realize that Nate can have 0 quarters and 12 dimes, or 1 quarter and 11 dimes, or 2 quarters and 10 dimes, and so on. Therefore, there are multiple solutions to this problem. To summarize, there are multiple solutions to this problem depending on the number of quarters and dimes that Nate has. We can use the equations x + y = 12 and 25x + 10y = 175 to find the number of each type of coin, but it's important to check that the solutions make sense in the context of the problem."},{"prompt":"Give tips on how to prepare for a job interview.","completion":"Research the company and industry, review common interview questions and prepare responses, dress appropriately, practice good hygiene, arrive on time, bring a copy of your resume and any relevant materials, be confident and courteous, and follow up with a thank-you note."},{"prompt":"Provide a stepbystep guide to making a spaghetti carbonara dish.","completion":"1.

The protests started in response to a proposed extradition bill, which would have allowed suspected criminals to be extradited to mainland China. The people of Hong Kong feared that this law would threaten their liberties as it would give China undue influence over Hong Kong. The government's efforts to push through the bill without input from the public led to mass protests and eventually the bill was withdrawn. However, the protests have continued over the past two years with a focus on broader issues such as democratic reforms, police brutality, and increasing interference by China in Hong Kong. The protests have been marked by both peaceful demonstrations and violent clashes with the police. The police have been accused of using excessive force, including tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets. There have also been reports of police brutality and abuse of power in dealing with protesters. The Chinese government has condemned the protests and has used propaganda to portray the protesters as violent extremists and foreign agents. The protests have had a significant impact on Hong Kong and its economy. Hong Kong's reputation as a stable financial hub has been damaged, and many foreign investors and companies have reconsidered their presence in the region. The political unrest has also resulted in a decline in tourism and consumer spending, negatively affecting the local economy. Overall, the protests in Hong Kong reflect a deep-seated desire for freedom, democracy, and protection of civil liberties. The ongoing tensions between the people of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government, and the Chinese government are likely to continue, making it a complex and evolving situation."},{"prompt":"Write a horror story with a surprise twist at the end.","completion":"There was a small village nestled in the heart of a dense forest.

Anaphase: The spindle fibers shorten, pulling the sister chromatids apart to opposite poles. 4. Telophase: Chromosomes reach opposite poles, and a new nuclear envelope forms around each set of chromosomes. The cell then undergoes cytokinesis, dividing the cytoplasm and forming two identical daughter cells.

While human populations are continuously increasing, our natural resources are finite and cannot sustain unlimited use. It is essential to conserve our natural resources to ensure that they are available for future generations. Firstly, conserving natural resources is important for the environment. The loss of natural habitats has resulted in the extinction of numerous plant and animal species. This loss not only changes the balance of the ecosystem but also deprives us of important sources of medicine and food. In contrast, the conservation of natural habitats can provide numerous benefits such as carbon storage, nutrient cycling, and soil formation. With these benefits, conservation is not only good for nature but also for human health and well-being. Secondly, conserving natural resources is essential for economic sustainability. Natural resources are the basis for the world's economy. For instance, trees are used to produce lumber, paper, and many other products. Water is a vital resource not only for human consumption but also for industries. Increasing the quality and quantity of natural resources leads to the creation of new jobs in sectors such as forestry, fisheries, and tourism. Lastly, conserving natural resources is vital for social sustainability. Many societies depend on natural resources for their livelihoods. Small-scale farmers rely on the soil, water, and biodiversity for their subsistence. Fishermen fish daily for their families and communities. They provide a source of food, income, and transportation. These communities depend on their resources to maintain their quality of life. Conservation of natural resources would ensure that these communities remain sustainable in the long term. In conclusion, conserving natural resources is vital for environmental, economic, and social sustainability. It is essential to recognize the importance of preserving natural resources for our planet's survival. We can do this by reducing our consumption of natural resources, recycling, and using renewable energy resources. The world's natural resources are finite, and we must act now to conserve them for future generations."},{"prompt":"What are the steps to properly clean a dirty bathroom?","completion":"1.

It was a soft and fluffy one, with colourful stripes that reminded her of a rainbow. As she drifted off to sleep, she heard a loud noise outside her window. She shook herself awake and looked outside, but she couldn't see anything in the darkness. Thinking it was just the wind, she snuggled back under the blanket and closed her eyes. But the noise didn't stop. It grew louder and more persistent. Then, suddenly, the window shattered, and a gust of freezing wind rushed into the room. Lily shrieked in terror and clutched her blanket tightly, hoping that it would protect her from whatever was outside. Then, she saw a shadowy figure slowly creeping towards her bed. Petrified, she closed her eyes and held her breath. The figure came closer and closer, until Lily could feel its breath on her face. But just as she thought she was about to be attacked, she heard a tiny meowing sound - and then a kitten, barely the size of her hand, leapt onto her bed, mewing plaintively. Suddenly, everything made sense. The kitten had knocked over a vase outside, which had startled Lily. It had then jumped onto the windowsill and accidentally broken the glass. Now, it was seeking shelter and warmth. Lily's blanket had been the perfect place for it to rest. Lily couldn't help but laugh, relieved that there was nothing to fear after all. She picked up the kitten and cuddled it close, wrapping her blanket around it as well. From that day on, the kitten became her trusty companion, and whenever the winter winds blew, they would both huddle under the rainbow blanket and drift off to sleep."},{"prompt":"Suggest a fun game to play with a group of friends.","completion":"Charades."},{"prompt":"Explain how a seed grows into a plant.","completion":"A seed grows into a plant through a process called germination.

Dialectical materialism: This concept is based on the idea that contradictions and conflicts are inherent in all systems and that change occurs through the resolution of these contradictions. 5.

In metaphase, the chromosomes align at the center of the cell, forming the metaphase plate. In anaphase, the sister chromatids separate and are pulled to opposite poles of the cell. Finally, during telophase, the chromosomes arrive at the poles of the cell and the nuclear envelope re-forms around each set of chromosomes, completing the division of the cell's nucleus."},{"prompt":"Fact checking tell me if the statement is true, false, or unknown, based on your knowledge and common sense: Humans only use 10% of their brains.","completion":"False.

The goal is to put your opponent's king in \\"checkmate,\\" meaning that the king is in a position to be captured and cannot escape capture.

The king can move one square in any direction, the queen can move diagonally, horizontally, or vertically, the rook can move horizontally or vertically, the bishop can move diagonally, the knight moves in an L-shape, and the pawn can move one or two squares forward on its first move and then one square forward thereafter. When a player's piece is able to capture an opposing piece, they may do so by moving their piece to the occupied square and removing the opponent's piece from the board. Special moves include \\"castling,\\" which moves the king and rook in a specific way, and \\"en passant,\\" which allows a pawn to capture an opposing pawn that has moved two squares on its previous turn.
