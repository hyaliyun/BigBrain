Their luminous efficacies compared to normal LEDs depend on the spectral distribution of the resultant light output and the original wavelength of the LED itself. For example, the luminous efficacy of a typical YAG yellow phosphor based white LED ranges from 3 to 5 times the luminous efficacy of the original blue LED because of the human eye's greater sensitivity to yellow than to blue (as modeled in the luminosity function). Due to the simplicity of manufacturing the phosphor method is still the most popular method for making highintensity white LEDs. The design and production of a light source or light fixture using a monochrome emitter with phosphor conversion is simpler and cheaper than a complex RGB system, and the majority of highintensity white LEDs presently on the market are manufactured using phosphor light conversion.

However, it can also be an opportunity for growth and self-reflection. One of the first steps to moving on from a relationship is to think about what it fulfilled for you. Was it companionship, love, or support? Understanding what the relationship provided you with can help you identify what you need to look for in future relationships. It is also essential to work through feelings of abandonment. Feeling abandoned by someone you care about can be heartbreaking, but it is important to remember that it is not a reflection of your worthiness of love and respect. It can be helpful to talk to someone about your feelings, whether it is a friend, family member or a therapist. This can help you process your emotions and move forward. Another crucial step in moving on from a relationship is validating your own self-worth. Sometimes a breakup can leave us feeling like we are not good enough, or that there must be something wrong with us if the relationship did not work out. However, it is essential to remind yourself that you are worthy of love and respect regardless of what happened in the relationship. Taking care of yourself through self-care and positive affirmations can help reinforce your self-worth. Finally, it is crucial to meet your own needs. You do not need someone else to make you happy or complete you. Instead, focus on doing things that make you happy and fulfilled, whether it is spending time with friends and family, pursuing a hobby, or learning new skills. By meeting your own needs, you will become more self-sufficient and less reliant on others for validation and happiness. In conclusion, moving on from a relationship can be challenging, but it can also be an opportunity for growth and self-reflection. By understanding what the relationship fulfilled for you, working through feelings of abandonment, validating your own self-worth, and meeting your own needs, you can heal and move forward in a positive and healthy way."},{"prompt":"Answer the question about text: Yesterday we went with our homeschooling cousins to The Atlanta History Center for homeschool day , with special activities and demonstrations of how things were done in the old days .

This can be accomplished in many different ways leading to a plethora of antenna designs. The vast majority of designs are fed with a balanced line (unlike a monopole antenna) and are based on the dipole antenna with additional components (or elements) which increase its directionality. Antenna gain in this instance describes the concentration of radiated power into a particular solid angle of space, as opposed to the spherically uniform radiation of the ideal radiator. The increased power in the desired direction is at the expense of that in the undesired directions.

The composer himself said to a pupil that concerts are never real music, you have to give up the idea of hearing in them all the most beautiful things of art. Contemporary accounts indicate that in performance, Chopin avoided rigid procedures sometimes incorrectly attributed to him, such as always crescendo to a high note, but that he was concerned with expressive phrasing, rhythmic consistency and sensitive colouring. Berlioz wrote in 1853 that Chopin has created a kind of chromatic embroidery ... whose effect is so strange and piquant as to be impossible to describe ... virtually nobody but Chopin himself can play this music and give it this unusual turn.

Some of the most significant rebellions during this period included the Pontiac's War in North America, the Sepoy Rebellion in India, and the Tacky's War in Jamaica. Pontiac's War, also known as the Pontiac Rebellion or Pontiac's Uprising, was an armed conflict that took place from 1763 to 1766 in the Great Lakes region of North America. The rebellion was led by a Native American chief named Pontiac, who sought to expel British troops and settlers from Native American lands. The conflict involved a series of raids and battles, and although the Native American forces enjoyed some early successes, they were ultimately defeated by the British. The Sepoy Rebellion was a major uprising against British rule that took place in India in 1857. The rebellion was led by Indian troops, known as Sepoys, who were angry about a number of grievances, including the use of cow and pig fat in rifle cartridges, which conflicted with their religious beliefs. The rebellion was brutally suppressed by the British, who ruthlessly put down any resistance. Tacky's War was a slave rebellion that took place in Jamaica in 1760. The rebellion was led by a slave named Tacky, who organized a group of slaves to rise up against their masters. The rebellion was initially successful, with the rebels managing to capture several plantations, but they were eventually defeated by superior British firepower. In conclusion, the 1760s saw a number of rebellions in different parts of the world, as people struggled against various forms of oppression and injustice. From Pontiac's War in North America to the Sepoy Rebellion in India and Tacky's War in Jamaica, these rebellions serve as a reminder of the power of human resilience and resistance in the face of injustice."},{"prompt":"Generate a sentence, and then tell me the concepts included in that sentence.","completion":"Sentence: \\"The cat sat on the windowsill, watching birds outside.\\" Concepts: - Subject: the cat - Action: sat - Location: on the windowsill - Object: birds - Observation: watching"},{"prompt":"w does the sentence end?

According to Van Zandt, \\"bands aren't woodshedding, aren't learning rock 'n' roll history.\\" This sentiment is shared by many in the industry, including record label executives who are concerned about the future of music. Despite this trend, there are still ways for musicians to counter it and preserve the rich history of rock 'n' roll. One of the most important ways is to use technology wisely. With the rise of streaming services and social media, it has never been easier to access and share music. Musicians should take advantage of this and use these platforms to not only promote their own music but also to share the music that has come before them. By creating playlists and sharing their musical influences, they can introduce their fans to new artists and genres, and help them develop a deeper appreciation for the history of rock 'n' roll. Another way to counter the trend is to invest in history. This means not only listening to and learning from the music that has come before, but also preserving it for future generations. One example of this is the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which celebrates the history and impact of rock 'n' roll. Musicians and fans can support organizations like this by visiting, donating, and advocating for their mission. Record label executives also have a role to play in preserving the history of rock 'n' roll. They can seek out and sign artists who not only have musical talent but also a passion for the history of the genre. As one record label head stated, \\"square pegs ultimately who are going to change the world.\\" By supporting these artists and their commitment to preserving the history of rock 'n' roll, labels can help counter the trend and ensure its legacy lives on. In conclusion, while the lack of musical education and appreciation for rock 'n' roll history in current bands is concerning, there are still ways for musicians and industry professionals to counter this trend. By using technology wisely, investing in history, and supporting artists with a passion for the genre's history, we can ensure that rock 'n' roll continues to inspire and influence future generations."},{"prompt":"Premise: I thought you'd rather I tooled you back to London.

Vibration moves the plates, causing the capacitance to vary, in turn inducing AC current. Some dielectrics also generate piezoelectricity. The resulting interference is especially problematic in audio applications, potentially causing feedback or unintended recording. In the reverse microphonic effect, the varying electric field between the capacitor plates exerts a physical force, moving them as a speaker. This can generate audible sound, but drains energy and stresses the dielectric and the electrolyte, if any. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply unanswerable): What sort of current is induced when the capacitance of a capacitor is altered?","completion":"When the capacitance of a capacitor is altered, an AC (alternating current) current is induced."},{"prompt":"Pearse Island is an island in western British Columbia, Canada, in the Portland Inlet, an inlet of the Pacific Ocean.

However, the scale has been criticized because it is still not a true continuum.

It occurs between particles or objects. It causes them to attract or repel each other. They do not even have to touch. This is unlike the typical push or pull you may be familiar with.

It is built along a support boom that is pointed toward the signal, and thus sees no induced signal and does not contribute to the antenna's operation. The end closer to the source is referred to as the front. Near the rear is a single active element, typically a halfwave dipole or folded dipole. Passive elements are arranged in front (directors) and behind (reflectors) the active element along the boom. The Yagi has the inherent quality that it becomes increasingly directional, and thus has higher gain, as the number of elements increases. However, this also makes it increasingly sensitive to changes in frequency; if the signal frequency changes, not only does the active element receive less energy directly, but all of the passive elements adding to that signal also decrease their output as well and their signals no longer reach the active element inphase.

Three popular systems are the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, Enneagram, and Keirsey Temperament Sorter. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is based on Carl Jung's theory of psychological types and categorizes personalities into 16 different types based on four main categories: extraversion/introversion, sensing/intuition, thinking/feeling, and judging/perceiving. By taking the MBTI, individuals can gain insights into their decision-making, communication styles, and overall personality preferences. The Enneagram is a personality system that categorizes individuals into nine different types based on their core fears and motivations. By understanding our Enneagram type, we can gain further insight into our strengths and weaknesses, as well as ways to grow and improve. The Keirsey Temperament Sorter (KTS) is another personality assessment tool that categorizes individuals into four temperaments: Artisan, Guardian, Rational, and Idealist. This system is based on the idea that each individual has a unique set of emotional needs and preferences that dictates how they interact with the world around them. Exploring these three systems can be a valuable exercise in self-reflection and personal growth. By gaining a better understanding of our personalities, we can improve our relationships, communication, and overall wellbeing."},{"prompt":"Does the sentence The most frequent characteristics of Helvetisms are in vocabulary, phrases, and pronunciation, but certain Helvetisms denote themselves as special in syntax and orthography likewise. provide a valid answer to the question Where are the most frequent characteristics of Helvetisms found?

With so many different products to choose from, it can be overwhelming trying to navigate which ones are truly necessary for our individual needs. However, there is one important factor that should always be considered: sunscreen. Sunscreen is crucial for protecting our skin from harmful UV rays that can cause aging, sun damage, and even skin cancer. It's recommended to apply sunscreen daily, but many people neglect this step in their skincare routine. Instead, they rely on a separate moisturizer and sunscreen, which can be time-consuming and potentially costly. One solution to this problem is to seek out a moisturizer that also includes sunscreen. This not only simplifies your skincare routine, but it also ensures that you're properly protecting your skin every day. To find a moisturizer with sunscreen, it's important to read labels and experiment with different products to see which ones work best for your skin type and needs. When looking for a moisturizer with SPF, it's important to look for a broad-spectrum sunscreen that protects against both UVA and UVB rays. This will ensure that you're getting maximum protection from the sun's harmful rays. You should also consider the level of SPF in the product. While SPF 30 is generally considered to be a good level of protection, you may need to go higher if you have particularly fair or sensitive skin. Finally, it's important to keep in mind that not all moisturizers with sunscreen are created equal. Some may feel heavy or greasy on the skin, while others may not provide enough moisture. It may take some trial and error to find the perfect moisturizer with sunscreen for you, but once you do, you'll have a simple and effective way to protect your skin every day. In summary, taking care of your skin should always include sunscreen protection. By seeking out a moisturizer that doubles as sunscreen, you can simplify your routine and ensure that you're getting the protection you need. Start by reading labels and experimenting with different products to find the perfect match for your skin. Your skin will thank you in the long run."},{"prompt":"On the bench , though , Jack had to shake himself from his Ennis reverie and concentrate on the game .

In 1908 Shuman formed the Sun Power Company with the intent of building larger solar power plants. He, along with his technical advisor A.S.E. Ackermann and British physicist Sir Charles Vernon Boys, developed an improved system using mirrors to reflect solar energy upon collector boxes, increasing heating capacity to the extent that water could now be used instead of ether.

Wilson and Theodore X. Barber first identified FPP in 1981, said to apply to about 4% of the population. Besides identifying this trait, Wilson and Barber reported a number of childhood antecedents that likely laid the foundation for fantasy proneness in later life, such as, \`\`a parent, grandparent, teacher, or friend who encouraged the reading of fairy tales, reinforced the child's ... fantasies, and treated the child's dolls and stuffed animals in ways that encouraged the child to believe that they were alive.'' They suggested that this trait was almost synonymous with those who responded dramatically to hypnotic induction, that is, \`\`high hypnotizables.'' The first systematic studies were conducted in the 1980s by psychologists Judith Rhue and Steven Jay Lynn.

To achieve that silky-smooth texture, there are a few simple steps you can follow. Firstly, it is crucial to use a daily moisturizing lotion on your legs. Moisturizing helps to keep your skin hydrated, which is essential for maintaining smooth skin. When you apply lotion, it not only hydrates your skin but also helps to prevent dryness and flakiness. Choose a lotion that suits your skin type and apply it generously all over your legs. Remember to apply lotion after shaving or waxing to soothe your skin and prevent irritation. Exfoliating your legs is also an important step towards achieving soft and smooth skin. Exfoliating helps to get rid of dead skin cells and reveals the fresh skin underneath. It not only helps to smooth the skin's surface but also allows moisturizers to penetrate better. You can use an exfoliating scrub, a loofah or a dry brush to exfoliate your legs. Be gentle to avoid damaging your skin, and exfoliate at least once a week for best results. Lastly, applying oil to your legs can help to enhance the smoothness of your skin. Oils like coconut, olive, and jojoba are great for hydrating your skin and preventing dryness. They also help to improve skin texture by promoting cell renewal. Apply a few drops of oil on your legs, rub it in gently and let it absorb. In conclusion, to get soft and smooth legs, it is important to follow these three simple steps: moisturizing, exfoliating, and oiling. By following these steps, you will notice a significant improvement in the texture of your skin. Remember to be consistent and patient, as it takes time to achieve the desired results.

Therefore, take time to write down what comes naturally to you, what you enjoy doing, and what you’re good at. 3. Use Positive Self-Talk The language you use can have a profound impact on your self-esteem. Therefore, be mindful of the way you speak about yourself. Instead of using negative self-talk that reinforces your insecurities and doubts, use positive affirmations. For example, instead of saying, “I’m not good enough,” replace it with “I am capable and worthy of success.” 4. Reward Yourself Finally, it's important to acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments. It’s easy to get caught up in chasing the next goal and forget about how far you’ve come. However, taking the time to appreciate your progress and reward yourself along the way helps to build confidence and motivation. In conclusion, implementing these four habits - journaling, listing your strengths, using positive self-talk, and rewarding yourself- can have a significant impact on your self-esteem. By making them part of your daily routine, you’ll start to see yourself in a more positive light and believe in your capabilities."},{"prompt":"l: Xmas is coming Daphne: and ...

It has many important functions. The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air.

Consider your options.","completion":"Sarcasm is a common form of humor that many people use to communicate their thoughts and feelings in a humorous way, especially in social settings. However, sarcasm can sometimes be misinterpreted as being hurtful, rude, or disrespectful. To avoid such misunderstandings, it is important to distinguish between playful and hurtful sarcasm. If you are faced with a sarcastic remark that you find hurtful or disrespectful, the best approach is to stay calm, assess the situation, and think about why you are reacting the way you are. You can then decide whether to ignore the remark, correct it as a mistake, or tell the person how you feel about it. Ignoring a sarcastic remark is sometimes the best option if you do not want to engage in an argument or if you think the person did not intend any harm. It can also be a way to show that you are not affected by the remark and that you have a sense of humor. Correcting a sarcastic remark as a mistake is another approach you can take. For instance, you can say, \\"I know you're just joking, but that remark felt a bit hurtful.\\" This way, you make it clear that you understand that the person was just trying to be funny, but that the remark still had a negative effect on you. Alternatively, you can tell the person how you feel about the remark. For instance, you can say, \\"I don't appreciate being spoken to that way.\\" This approach can be more effective if the remark was clearly intended to be hurtful or disrespectful. In conclusion, dealing with sarcasm can be challenging, but by distinguishing between playful and hurtful sarcasm, ignoring the remark, correcting it as a mistake, or telling the person how you feel about it, you can handle the situation in a way that is respectful and effective."},{"prompt":"The center of an atom is held together by powerful forces.

Czech influence on Slovak was protested by Slovak scholars, and when Slovakia broke off from Czechoslovakia in 1938 as the Slovak State (which then aligned with Nazi Germany in World War II) literary Slovak was deliberately distanced from Czech. When the Axis powers lost the war and Czechoslovakia reformed, Slovak developed somewhat on its own (with Czech influence); during the Prague Spring of 1968, Slovak gained independence from (and equality with) Czech.

Wash the garment using the cycle and temperature on the care tag. Wash the garment again if the stain remains. Dry the garment once the stain is completely gone.","completion":"Laundry Stain Removal: Tips and Tricks We've all been there - you're enjoying a favorite meal or drink, and somehow, a pesky stain ends up right on your clothes. You know the feeling - frustration, annoyance, and a little bit of dread as you realize that you'll need to tackle the stain as soon as possible. But don't worry! With a few simple steps and the right tools, you can easily remove stubborn stains and keep your clothes looking great. The first step in any laundry stain removal process is to assess the type of stain you're dealing with. Different types of stains (oil, grease, wine, etc.) require different treatments in order to be fully removed. Once you've identified the type of stain, you can take specific steps to address it. The next step is to apply a pre-treatment stain remover. These products are specially designed to break down the molecules in the stain, making it easier to remove during the washing process. Make sure to follow the instructions on the product packaging and apply the stain remover directly to the stain before washing. When it comes to washing the garment, it's important to follow the care instructions on the clothing tag. This includes the cycle type (delicate, normal, etc.) and the recommended water temperature. Using the wrong cycle or temperature can not only damage the garment but also make it harder to remove the stain. If the stain remains after the first wash cycle, don't panic! Simply wash the garment again, using the same cycle and temperature settings, and reapply the stain remover as needed. For particularly stubborn stains, you may need to repeat this process several times until the stain is completely gone. Finally, once the stain is gone, it's time to dry the garment. If the care tag recommends tumble drying, use a low heat setting to avoid shrinking or damaging the clothing. For delicate fabrics, consider air-drying instead. With these simple steps, you'll be able to remove even the toughest laundry stains and keep your clothes looking their best. Remember to always read the care tag and use the appropriate stain remover product for the best results.

In the United States, trade secrets are protected under state law, and states have nearly universally adopted the Uniform Trade Secrets Act. The United States also has federal law in the form of the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 (18 U.S.C. §§ 1831–1839), which makes the theft or misappropriation of a trade secret a federal crime. This law contains two provisions criminalizing two sorts of activity. The first, 18 U.S.C. § 1831(a), criminalizes the theft of trade secrets to benefit foreign powers. The second, 18 U.S.C. § 1832, criminalizes their theft for commercial or economic purposes. (The statutory penalties are different for the two offenses.) In Commonwealth common law jurisdictions, confidentiality and trade secrets are regarded as an equitable right rather than a property right but penalties for theft are roughly the same as the United States.[citation needed] Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return unanswerable): What do most US states use the Economic Espionage Act to protect?","completion":"Most US states use the Uniform Trade Secrets Act to protect trade secrets, not the Economic Espionage Act."},{"prompt":"Which is this about?

The crime was brutal, with Limon being beaten and stabbed nine times. The motive for the murder was unclear, but it was believed to be related to a drug cartel in Honduras. Rivera Gracias had connections to a gang that operated in several countries, and it was suggested that Limon was murdered because he was interfering with their plans. After the incident, Rivera Gracias fled to Honduras, where he was eventually arrested and extradited to the United States for trial. The trial lasted several years, during which time Rivera Gracias maintained his innocence. However, in 2017, after a long trial, Rivera Gracias was found guilty of the murder of Richard Limon and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Interestingly, Rivera Gracias was not the only one who was convicted for the crime. His girlfriend, mother, and mother's boyfriend were also convicted of various charges related to the murder. His girlfriend was sentenced to 20 years in prison, while his mother and her boyfriend both received 15-year sentences. The case drew attention to the issue of gang violence and drug cartels, which have been a significant problem in Honduras and other countries in Central America. The incident also highlighted the need for better cooperation between law enforcement agencies across different countries to tackle transnational crime.

Tibetan Buddhism sometimes adds a fourth refuge, in the lama. In Mahayana, the person who chooses the bodhisattva path makes a vow or pledge, considered the ultimate expression of compassion. In Mahayana, too, the Three Jewels are perceived as possessed of an eternal and unchanging essence and as having an irreversible effect: The Three Jewels have the quality of excellence. Just as real jewels never change their faculty and goodness, whether praised or reviled, so are the Three Jewels (Refuges), because they have an eternal and immutable essence.

It analyzed the bullets with the goal of matching them chemically, not only to a single batch of ammunition coming out of a factory, but also to a single box of bullets. The National Academy of Sciences conducted an 18month independent review of comparative bulletlead analysis. In 2003, its National Research Council published a report whose conclusions called into question 30 years of FBI testimony.

Talks between FARC and the government are crucial to ending 50 years of fighting.","completion":"Colombia's Paulina Vega Wins Miss Universe, While Talks Hold Key to Ending Decades of Conflict Last month, there was much excitement in Colombia as one of their own was crowned Miss Universe. Paulina Vega wowed the judges with her beauty, poise and intelligence, beating out 87 other contestants to claim the title. Her victory was celebrated across the country, with many seeing it as a welcome distraction from the ongoing conflict that has plagued their nation for over 50 years. Talks between the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the government have been ongoing for some time now, with the aim of bringing an end to the decades of fighting that have left thousands dead and displaced millions. Progress has been slow, but many remain optimistic that a deal can be reached. The FARC, a leftist guerrilla group, have been fighting the government since the 1960s, with the aim of achieving greater social and economic equality in the country. The conflict has been marked by atrocities committed by both sides, including massacres, kidnappings and bombings. One of the key issues on the table in the talks is land reform. The FARC want to see more land distributed to poor farmers, while the government is looking to attract more foreign investment to boost the economy. Other issues include the group's future political participation, drug trafficking and the rights of victims. While progress is being made in the talks, there are still hurdles to overcome. Many Colombians remain sceptical about the FARC's commitment to a peaceful resolution, and there are concerns that hardline elements within the group may try to sabotage any agreement. Nevertheless, the fact that talks are ongoing is a positive sign. The conflict has had a devastating impact on Colombian society, with millions displaced and families torn apart. A peaceful resolution would bring much-needed stability to the country, and could help to spur economic growth and development. As the world watches and waits, however, there are still reasons to celebrate. Paulina Vega's victory in the Miss Universe contest is a reminder that Colombia has much to offer the world beyond its troubled past. Her success is a symbol of hope and a sign that, with determination and hard work, anything is possible."},{"prompt":"Good Morning, Starting tomorrow we will be posting the morning VaR report to the web.

In recent broadband tests, the Verizon iPhone and AT&T iPhone were pitted against each other to determine which smartphone is dominant in terms of speed and call quality. Both carriers have their pros and cons, but the verdict ultimately depends on what you value more in a smartphone. If you're looking for a smartphone that prioritizes voice quality and call reliability, you should opt for the Verizon iPhone. This is because Verizon operates on a different network than AT&T, and their network coverage and signal strength are superior in many areas. Verizon uses CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) technology, which allows for fewer dropped calls and clearer conversations, as long as you have a good network connection. On the other hand, if you're more interested in using your smartphone for media consumption, the AT&T iPhone may be the better choice. AT&T uses GSM (Global System for Mobiles) technology, which provides faster internet speeds, making it ideal for streaming videos and music. While the Verizon iPhone also offers 4G LTE, AT&T's network remains faster overall. When it comes to data and voice plans, it is important to note that AT&T offers an unlimited data plan, while Verizon does not. However, Verizon offers more flexible plans and a wider range of options, particularly for international travel. In conclusion, the choice between the Verizon iPhone and AT&T iPhone ultimately comes down to individual priorities. If call quality and reliability are important, the Verizon iPhone is the way to go. For fast internet speeds and media consumption, the AT&T iPhone is the winner.

In household cult, the paterfamilias functioned as priest, and members of his familia as acolytes and assistants. Public cults required greater knowledge and expertise. The earliest public priesthoods were probably the flamines (the singular is flamen), attributed to king Numa: the major flamines, dedicated to Jupiter, Mars and Quirinus, were traditionally drawn from patrician families. Twelve lesser flamines were each dedicated to a single deity, whose archaic nature is indicated by the relative obscurity of some.

When the bird exhales, the used air flows out of the lung and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs. Thus, a bird's lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation. Sound production is achieved using the syrinx, a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from the lower end of the trachea; the trachea being elongated in some species, increasing the volume of vocalizations and the perception of the bird's size.

In 1900, the state legislature passed a new constitution, with voter registration rules that disfranchised most blacks and many poor whites. The state succeeded in reducing black voting to zero by 1908. Loss of the ability to vote disqualified black men (and later women) from sitting on juries and serving in any office, local, state or federal. The rising black middleclass in Raleigh and other areas was politically silenced and shut out of local governance, and the Republican Party was no longer competitive.

Kick them out of their roosting sites. Buy bird strips for your house. Use a scare pigeon.","completion":"Keeping your property clean and free from bird droppings is essential for maintaining a clean and healthy environment. Birds, especially pigeons, often roost on buildings and leave behind droppings that not only look unsightly but can also cause health hazards. To keep birds from roosting on your property, the first step is to get rid of their roosting sites. Check for any holes or gaps in the building structure and seal them up. Make sure to remove any food sources or debris that may attract birds. Installing bird strips is another effective way to deter birds from roosting on your property. These strips are made of plastic or metal and feature spikes that stick out at different angles, making it uncomfortable for birds to land on them. When installed on ledges or other areas where birds like to perch, bird strips can effectively prevent birds from roosting. If you want to scare away pigeons, a scare pigeon can be an effective solution. Scare pigeons are made of plastic or rubber and look like real pigeons. Placing a few of these decoys around your property can help prevent real pigeons from roosting, as they will see the decoy pigeons as competition for food or shelter. Keeping your property free from bird droppings not only improves the aesthetics but also prevents the spread of diseases. By getting rid of bird roosting sites, installing bird strips, and using scare pigeons, you can effectively keep birds from your property and maintain a clean and healthy environment."},{"prompt":"Well, it starts with enforcing law.

Bolt, who is in the Scottish city to compete in the 4x100m men's relay, has reportedly claimed in off-hand comments that the Olympics 'were better'. The remarks have sparked backlash from online users who fear that Bolt may receive a frosty reception from the Scottish crowds.

In the lead up to the atomic bombings of Japan, military officials estimated that an invasion of Japan could result in one million American casualties and ten million Japanese deaths. This potential loss of life was a major factor in the decision to use atomic bombs to end the war quickly. 2. The firebombing of Tokyo in March 1945 killed an estimated 100,000 people and destroyed much of the city. This single attack was more destructive than any other conventional bombing raid during World War II. 3. The Allies had already expended enormous resources and manpower in the war effort and were looking for ways to end the war quickly and definitively. The atomic bomb offered the possibility of achieving this goal. 4.

However, many people find it difficult to accept praise gracefully. Learning how to take a compliment is an important life skill that can boost one's self-confidence and improve relationships with others. Here are some tips to help you learn how to receive compliments with grace and sincerity: Accept that you cannot change other people. It is important to remember that everyone has their own opinions and reactions. It's impossible to please everyone, no matter what you do. So, accept that other people will say and do things that you can't control, and move on from there. This attitude will also help you to focus more on your own reactions to praise and to learn how to appreciate yourself. Learn to stay positive. One of the reasons some people struggle to take compliments is that they are pessimistic or have low self-esteem. If you find yourself thinking negative thoughts about yourself or a situation, try to find something positive to focus on instead. Changing your mindset can help you appreciate compliments more and feel more comfortable about accepting them. Remain calm. When someone praises you, it's natural to feel good about your accomplishments. However, some people can take this too far and become overly excited or even aggressive. It's important to remain calm and composed when receiving compliments, especially in social or professional settings. This will help you to create a positive impression on others, and make you feel more confident in your own abilities. In conclusion, learning to take a compliment is an essential skill for building self-esteem and positive relationships with others. By accepting that you can't change others, staying positive, and remaining calm when receiving praise, you'll be on your way to creating a more fulfilling life.

Experts estimate that this famine may have killed anywhere from 15 to 45 million people, making it one of the worst humanitarian disasters of the 20th century. Another devastating famine was the Irish Potato Famine of 1845-1849, which is estimated to have claimed the lives of around one million people due to a combination of crop failure, disease, and government inaction. The Bengal Famine of 1943-1944 is another example of a catastrophic famine, which was the result of wartime policies and natural disasters. It is estimated that around two million people lost their lives during this famine, which was exacerbated by government mismanagement and a lack of assistance from the British colonial authorities. Other famines that have claimed millions of lives throughout history include the Soviet famine of 1932-1933, the Ethiopian famine of 1983-1985, and the North Korean famine of 1994-1998. While the exact death tolls of these famines may never be known for certain, it is clear that they have had a devastating impact on human populations throughout history.
