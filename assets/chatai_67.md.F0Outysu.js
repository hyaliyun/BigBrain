You also mentioned that you want to avoid using any third-party libraries or frameworks. One approach you could take is to use CSS Grid to create a flexible and responsive layout for your gallery. You can set up a grid container with display: grid; and define the column template using grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(55px, 1fr));. This will create a grid that automatically adjusts its columns to fit the available space and ensures that each item has a minimum width of 55 pixels. To center the images both horizontally and vertically, you can add justify-items: center; and align-items: center; to the grid container. You can also add overflow-x: scroll; to enable horizontal scrolling when there are too many images to fit in one row. For the image preview, you can use a separate element with a fixed size and apply object-fit: contain; to ensure that the image scales down proportionally while maintaining its aspect ratio. You can also add some padding and a border to the preview element to give it some breathing room. When it comes to rearranging the images, you can use JavaScript to dynamically update the layout based on the size and shape of each image. One way to achieve this is by creating an array of objects containing information about each image (e.g., its width, height, and aspect ratio) and then iterating through the array to calculate the optimal layout for each image. are you able to compile this code into a fully funtioning html,css,javascript single page example? output your implementation in a single compiled fashion to demonstrate how it works and should perform. no, in a single html-block in this chat, without splitting on language sections. try output your output in a plain-unformatted-text. it looks your responses get dramatically performatted on the way to this chat window interface made in gradio on huggingface.co: what if you represent your code outputs as normal textual message?

It allows you to search for similar terms or misspelled variations of a word or phrase. For example, if you search for \\"apple~\\" in an Elastic index that contains documents with the word \\"apple\\", it would also return documents that contain terms like \\"apples\\", \\"appl\\", or \\"aple\\" because these terms have a small similarity to the original search term. The degree of similarity depends on the fuzzy parameter provided, which can be adjusted to make the matching stricter or more lenient. Fuzzy matching is particularly useful when dealing with typographical errors, misspellings, or variations in word forms. It helps to retrieve relevant documents even if the exact search term is not present."},{"prompt":"what is _score in elastic","completion":"In Elastic, the \`_score\` is a relevance score assigned to each document that represents how well it matches the query specified in the search request. The score is calculated based on various factors, such as term frequency, inverse document frequency, field length, and any additional relevancy boosting applied to the fields. The score is returned as part of the search results and can be used to rank the documents based on their relevance to the query. Higher scores indicate a better match between the document and the query, while lower scores indicate a weaker match. The \`_score\` can be used to implement custom sorting or filtering logic in search applications. For instance, you can sort search results by score in descending order to prioritize the most relevant documents at the top of the list. Additionally, you can apply a minimum score threshold to filter out less relevant documents from the results."},{"prompt":"right now im spliting the search in elastic and return the result base on _score desc qParts := strings.Split(q, \\" \\") for _, qPart := range qParts { if qPart == \\" \\" { continue } queryValue += qPart + \\"*~\\" + \\" \\" } how to give more score to first word in the search","completion":"To give more weight or score to the first word in the search query, you can utilize the concept of boosting in Elastic. Boosting allows you to assign higher importance to specific terms or fields during the scoring process. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to boost the score of the first word in the search query: \`\`\`go qParts := strings.Split(q, \\" \\") var queryValue string for i, qPart := range qParts { if qPart == \\" \\" { continue } // Boost the score of the first word by using a higher boost value boost := 1.0 if i == 0 { boost = 2.0 // Adjust the boost value as needed } queryValue += qPart + \\"^\\" + strconv.FormatFloat(boost, 'f', -1, 64) + \\"*~\\" + \\" \\" } \`\`\` In this example, we assign a boost value of 2.0 to the first word in the search query, and a boost value of 1.0 to the remaining words. You can adjust the boost values based on your requirements. By using the \`^\` symbol followed by the boost value (converted to a string), we indicate the desired boost for each term in the search query. Boosting the score of the first word will help prioritize documents that have a stronger match with the initial search term."},{"prompt":"this is my code, each product also has inventory how to reduce the _score based on inventory func (r productRepository) Find(ctx context.Context, index string, q, limit, offset, sortField, order string, extraFieldName, extraFieldValue string, filter ...map[string]interface{}) (interface{}, error) { mainBlock := block{} mainBlock[\\"from\\"] = offset mainBlock[\\"size\\"] = limit mainBlock[\\"sort\\"] = blocks{ block{\\"_score\\": block{\\"order\\": \\"DESC\\"}}, } if sortField != \\"\\" { mainBlock[\\"sort\\"] = blocks{block{sortField: block{\\"order\\": order}}} } fields := []string{\\"Name^8\\", \\"CategoryTitle^5\\", \\"NodeName\\", \\"UnitName\\"} queryValue := \\"\\" qParts := strings.Split(q, \\" \\") for _, qPart := range qParts { if qPart == \\" \\" { continue } queryValue += qPart + \\"*~\\" + \\" \\" } queryStringBlock := blocks{block{ \\"query_string\\": block{\\"query\\": queryValue, \\"fields\\": fields, \\"analyzer\\": \\"rebuilt_persian\\"}, }} boolBlock := block{} boolBlock[\\"must\\"] = queryStringBlock if len(filter) > 0 { var filterBlocks blocks for _, f := range filter { filterBlocks = append(filterBlocks, block{\\"range\\": f}) } boolBlock[\\"filter\\"] = filterBlocks } mainBlock[\\"query\\"] = block{\\"bool\\": boolBlock} return r.find(ctx, index, mainBlock) }","completion":"To adjust the _score based on the inventory of products, you can utilize a function score query in Elastic.

It is analogous to a database table in a traditional relational database system. An index is created to organize and store data efficiently, making it searchable and retrievable. Each document within an index is assigned a unique identifier called a document ID. Documents within an index can be retrieved, updated, or deleted based on various search and query operations. Indices in Elastic are schema-free, which means you don't need to define a strict structure for the documents stored in an index. However, Elasticsearch implicitly indexes the fields within a document, allowing for flexible searching and querying capabilities. Multiple indices can be created within an Elasticsearch cluster for different purposes, allowing for logical separation and efficient data management. Each index can have its own configurations, settings, and mappings tailored to the specific needs of the data it contains. Indices play a vital role in Elastic's distributed architecture, providing scalability, fault tolerance, and flexibility in handling large volumes of data across multiple nodes."},{"prompt":"what is \\"analyzer\\": \\"rebuilt_persian\\" in elastic query","completion":"In Elastic, the \\"analyzer\\": \\"rebuilt_persian\\" parameter in a query refers to the specific analyzer that should be used to process and tokenize text written in the Persian language. Analyzers in Elastic are responsible for analyzing and breaking down text into individual terms (also known as tokens) that can be efficiently indexed and searched. Different languages require specific analyzers to handle language-specific rules and features. The \\"rebuilt_persian\\" analyzer is a built-in analyzer in Elasticsearch that is specifically designed for Persian text. It is part of the Persian language analysis plugin, which provides additional functionalities for processing Persian text, such as normalization, stemming, and stop words removal. When the \\"rebuilt_persian\\" analyzer is used in a query, it means that the text being analyzed and searched is expected to be in Persian, and the Elasticsearch engine will apply the relevant language-specific rules and transformations during the tokenization process. By leveraging language-specific analyzers, like \\"rebuilt_persian,\\" the search results become more accurate and provide better language-specific functionality for Persian text analysis and retrieval."},{"prompt":"what is \\"fuzziness\\": 1,","completion":"In Elastic, the \\"fuzziness\\" parameter is used in a query to specify the maximum allowable edit distance between the search term and the terms in the indexed documents. It is commonly used in fuzzy matching or approximate string matching scenarios. The \\"fuzziness\\" value determines how closely the search term can match the terms in the indexed documents, based on edit operations such as adding, removing, or substituting characters. A value of 1 indicates that a single edit operation (insertion, deletion, or substitution) is allowed to achieve a match. For example, if you search for the term \\"apple\\" with a fuzziness value of 1, it would also match documents containing terms like \\"apples\\", \\"appl\\", or \\"aple\\" because they are within an edit distance of 1 from the original search term. You can adjust the \\"fuzziness\\" value to make the fuzzy matching stricter or more lenient depending on your requirements. Higher values will allow for a higher number of edit operations, resulting in more potential matches but potentially lower precision. The \\"fuzziness\\" parameter is typically used in conjunction with other query parameters, such as the \\"query_string\\" or \\"match\\" query, to enable fuzzy matching in Elasticsearch queries."},{"prompt":"total vs hit in elastic result","completion":"In Elastic, when you perform a search query, the search response contains two key components related to the number of hits: \\"total\\" and \\"hits\\". 1. \\"total\\": The \\"total\\" field in the search response indicates the total number of documents in the index that match the search query, regardless of the pagination or size of the search results returned. It represents the overall count of documents that satisfy the search criteria. 2. \\"hits\\": The \\"hits\\" field contains an array of individual search results that match the query and are returned as part of the search response. It includes only a subset of the total matching documents based on the specified pagination (such as \\"size\\" and \\"from\\" parameters) or default settings. For example, suppose you perform a search query that matches 100 documents in total. However, you set the \\"size\\" parameter to 10, which indicates that you want to display only 10 documents per page. In this case, the \\"total\\" field would be 100, representing the total count of matching documents, while the \\"hits\\" field would contain 10 document objects representing the limited result set for the current page. The \\"total\\" field provides an overview of the total number of matching documents, giving you an idea of the scale of results. On the other hand, the \\"hits\\" field presents the specific documents that are currently returned based on the pagination settings. It's important to note that the \\"total\\" field is calculated accurately in Elasticsearch, while the \\"hits\\" field only contains a subset of documents based on the specified pagination to improve performance and reduce the size of the response."},{"prompt":"give a python code for increasing the image brightness and contrast vc2","completion":"Here's an example code that can increase the image brightness and contrast using OpenCV library in Python: \`\`\`python import cv2 import numpy as np def increase_brightness(img, value): hsv = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV) h, s, v = cv2.split(hsv) v = cv2.add(v, value) v = np.where(v > 255, 255, v) final_hsv = cv2.merge((h, s, v)) img = cv2.cvtColor(final_hsv, cv2.COLOR_HSV2BGR) return img def increase_contrast(img, alpha, beta): img = cv2.convertScaleAbs(img, alpha=alpha, beta=beta) return img # Read the image image = cv2.imread('path/to/your/image.jpg') # Increase brightness, value can be positive or negative image = increase_brightness(image, 50) # Increase contrast, alpha > 1 increases the contrast, 0 < beta < 100 decreases the brightness image = increase_contrast(image, 1.5, 0) # Display the modified image cv2.imshow('Modified Image', image) cv2.waitKey(0) cv2.destroyAllWindows() \`\`\` Make sure to replace \`'path/to/your/image.jpg'\` with the actual path to your image file.

He was born on June 7, 1848, in Paris, France and died on May 8, 1903, in Atuona, Marquesas Islands, French Polynesia. Gauguin is well-known for his vibrant use of color and painterly style. In his early career, Gauguin worked as a stockbroker while pursuing his passion for art in his spare time. He eventually decided to fully dedicate himself to painting and joined the Impressionist movement in the late 1870s. However, he soon grew dissatisfied with Impressionism and developed a more symbolist and primitive style. Gauguin is particularly famous for his paintings inspired by his travels to Tahiti and other Polynesian islands. These works often depicted scenes of tropical landscapes, native people, and local customs. He sought to portray a simpler and more authentic way of life that he felt was lacking in Western society. Gauguin's art received mixed reviews during his lifetime, and he struggled financially. However, his work became highly influential after his death, and he is now considered one of the most important figures in the development of modern art. His use of bold colors and simplified forms had a significant impact on later artistic movements, such as Fauvism and Expressionism."},{"prompt":"Sodium fluoride for teeth Fluoride effectively prevents tooth decay. Therefore, this material is used in toothpaste and other dental hygiene products. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the most common type of fluoride used in toothpaste and mouthwashes is sodium fluoride. In general, the benefits of sodium fluoride for teeth are reported as follows: Reducing the sensitivity of teeth to cold and heat It helps to improve dental plaque Eliminate bacteria and prevent decay As we said, sodium fluoride contains ionic compounds. These ions penetrate the tooth enamel and thereby make the tooth resistant to decaying factors. Therefore, when the teeth have surface decay, fluoride therapy can be used to stop the decay. Fluoride therapy is highly recommended for people with orthodontics. According to doctors, it is better to start this treatment from the age of 6.REWRITER WITH BIG CHANGE","completion":"Sodium fluoride is widely used in dental care products like toothpaste and mouthwashes due to its effectiveness in preventing tooth decay. It offers various benefits for oral health: 1. Strengthens tooth enamel: Sodium fluoride contains ionic compounds that can penetrate the tooth enamel, making it more resistant to factors that cause decay. 2. Reduces tooth sensitivity: By strengthening the enamel, sodium fluoride helps reduce sensitivity to temperature changes, such as hot and cold sensations. 3. Improves dental plaque: Sodium fluoride can aid in the reduction of dental plaque, a sticky film of bacteria that builds up on teeth and contributes to decay. 4. Prevents bacterial growth: Sodium fluoride has antibacterial properties, which can help eliminate harmful bacteria in the mouth and inhibit their growth, thus preventing decay. For individuals with surface decay, fluoride therapy is often recommended to halt the progression of decay. This treatment is especially beneficial for people with orthodontic appliances. Dentists typically advise starting fluoride therapy around the age of 6 to provide optimal dental protection."},{"prompt":"gallery that can dynamically rearrange its layout based on the size and shape of each image. You also mentioned that you want to avoid using any third-party libraries or frameworks. One approach you could take is to use CSS Grid to create a flexible and responsive layout for your gallery. You can set up a grid container with display: grid; and define the column template using grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(55px, 1fr));. This will create a grid that automatically adjusts its columns to fit the available space and ensures that each item has a minimum width of 55 pixels. To center the images both horizontally and vertically, you can add justify-items: center; and align-items: center; to the grid container. You can also add overflow-x: scroll; to enable horizontal scrolling when there are too many images to fit in one row. For the image preview, you can use a separate element with a fixed size and apply object-fit: contain; to ensure that the image scales down proportionally while maintaining its aspect ratio. You can also add some padding and a border to the preview element to give it some breathing room. When it comes to rearranging the images, you can use JavaScript to dynamically update the layout based on the size and shape of each image. One way to achieve this is by creating an array of objects containing information about each image (e.g., its width, height, and aspect ratio) and then iterating through the array to calculate the optimal layout for each image. are you able to compile this code into a fully funtioning html,css,javascript single page example? output your implementation in a single compiled fashion to demonstrate how it works and should perform. no, in a single html-block in this chat, without splitting on language sections. try output your output in a plain-unformatted-text. it looks your responses get dramatically performatted on the way to this chat window interface made in gradio on huggingface.co: what if you represent your code outputs as normal textual message?

Találj olyan mozgásformát, ami számodra élvezetes és motiváló, például csoportos órák vagy kültéri edzések. 3. Táplálkozz egészségesen: Az edzőteremben végzett munka csak akkor hozza meg a kívánt eredményeket, ha egészségesen táplálkozol. Keresd meg az egyensúlyt az egészségtudatos ételek és a mértékletes étkezés között. Kombinálj fehérjéket, komplex szénhidrátokat és jó zsírokat az étrendedben. 4. Hangolódj a pozitív gondolkodásra: A testedzés és az életmódváltás nem csak a fizikai változásokról szól, hanem a mentális fejlődésről is. Gyakorold a pozitív gondolkodást, és motiváld magad a célok elérésére. Az önbizalom és az időbeli elkötelezettség kulcsfontosságú a sikerhez. 5. Kérj segítséget: Ha úgy érzed, hogy nehézségekbe ütközöl az életmódváltásban, fordulj szakemberhez vagy trénerhez. Ők segíthetnek neked a megfelelő edzésterv, táplálkozás és mentális támogatás kialakításában. Ne feledd, mindannyian képesek vagyunk változtatni az életünkön és visszanyerni az egészségünket.

Much of this false history began with protestant propaganda, and was later adopted by the most virulent secularists and atheists during the so-called \\"Enlightenment\\" period. It is now taken for granted by most. One of the books that really opened my mind to the possibility I had been deceived was written by the recently deceased, highly respected non-Catholic scholar of religion, Rodney Stark. That book was published in 2016, and was entitled: \\"Bearing False Witness: Debunking Centuries of Anti-Catholic History.\\" At the end of its introduction, Stark wrote: \\"I am not a Roman Catholic, and I did not write this book in defense of the Church. I wrote it in defense of history.\\" \\"But it wasn’t only angry Protestants who invented and embraced these tales,\\" he wrote. \\"Many of the falsehoods considered in subsequent chapters were sponsored by antireligious writers, especially during the so-called Enlightenment, whose work was condoned only because it was seen as anti-Catholic rather than as what it truly was.\\" In the same introduction, he listed a series of assertions about the Catholic Church that are commonly believed, but false. \\"Each of these statements is part of the common culture, widely accepted and frequently repeated,\\" he said. \\"But, each is false and many are the exact opposite of the truth!\\" \\"In any event,\\" he declared, \\"should you doubt that your knowledge of Western history is distorted by the work of these distinguished [anti-Catholic] bigots, consider whether you believe any of the following statements.\\" Those statements are as follows (pp. 4-5): “· The Catholic Church motivated and actively participated in nearly two millennia of anti-Semitic violence, justifying it on grounds that the Jews were responsible for the Crucifixion, until the Vatican II Council was shamed into retracting that doctrine in 1965. But, the Church still has not made amends for the fact that Pope Pius XII is rightfully known as “Hitler’s Pope.” · Only recently have we become aware of remarkably enlightened Christian gospels, long ago suppressed by narrow-minded Catholic prelates. · Once in power as the official church of Rome, Christians quickly and brutally persecuted paganism out of existence. · The fall of Rome and the ascendancy of the Church precipitated Europe’s decline into a millennium of ignorance and backwardness. These Dark Ages lasted until the Renaissance/Enlightenment, when secular scholars burst through the centuries of Catholic barriers against reason. · Initiated by the pope, the Crusades were but the first bloody chapter in the history of unprovoked and brutal European colonialism. · The Spanish Inquisition tortured and murdered huge numbers of innocent people for “imaginary” crimes, such as witchcraft and blasphemy. · The Catholic Church feared and persecuted scientists, as the case of Galileo makes clear. Therefore, the Scientific “Revolution” occurred mainly in Protestant societies because only there could the Catholic Church not suppress independent thought. · Being entirely comfortable with slavery, the Catholic Church did nothing to oppose its introduction in the New World nor to make it more humane. · Until very recently, the Catholic view of the ideal state was summed up in the phrase, “The divine right of kings.” Consequently, the Church has bitterly resisted all efforts to establish more liberal governments, eagerly supporting dictators. · It was the Protestant Reformation that broke the repressive Catholic grip on progress and ushered in capitalism, religious freedom, and the modern world.” If you are willing to explore how most of us have been systematically lied to about the Catholic Church (which is NOT to say there is nothing bad—far from it), I highly recommend this book.","completion":"Thank you for sharing your perspective and recommending the book \\"Bearing False Witness: Debunking Centuries of Anti-Catholic History\\" by Rodney Stark.

Every single one of the female night elves was pregnant, each in their 7th month, and nobody knows why. But as 8 of the night elf mothers gather, one of the mothers starts to feel extreme pain in her stomach.)","completion":"Mother 1: (grimacing in pain) Oh, Elune, this pain is unbearable! Mother 2: (placing a comforting hand on Mother 1's shoulder) Hang in there, sister. We're almost to the healers' grove. They'll know what to do. Mother 3: (concerned) This is unlike anything I've ever experienced. It's like the baby is trying to claw its way out! Mother 4: (frantically) We need to get her help immediately! The healers will know what to do. Mother 5: (trying to stay calm) The healers will know, and they won't let anything happen to you or your baby. Mother 6: (clutching her own belly) I can't believe we're all going through this strange ordeal together. It's so unnerving. Mother 7: (nodding) It's as if our pregnancies are connected somehow. But why? What could have caused this? Mother 8: (taking deep breaths) Let's focus on getting Mother 1 to the healers' grove first. We can figure out the rest later. (With the help of the other mothers, they guide Mother 1 towards the healers' grove, their footsteps echoing through the grand tree. As they arrive, the healers rush to Mother 1's side.) Healer 1: What seems to be the problem? Mother 2: (anxious) She's experiencing intense pain in her stomach, and it's become unbearable. Healer 2: (examining Mother 1) We'll have to do some tests to determine the cause. It's possible this is linked to the unusual pregnancies happening in Shadowglen. Mother 3: (worried) But what does it all mean? Is this some sort of curse? Healer 1: We won't know until we investigate further. Right now, we need to focus on Mother 1 and her baby's well-being. (As the healers work, the other mothers gather around, waiting anxiously for news.) Mother 4: (whispering) I just can't believe this is happening to us. It feels like a nightmare. Mother 6: (trying to stay positive) We've always been a strong race, sisters. We'll overcome this, no matter what. Mother 5: (holding back tears) I just want all our babies to be safe and healthy. We've waited so long for this joy. (Several tense moments pass until the healers finally finish their examination and approach the group of worried mothers.) Healer 2: (with a serious expression) I have the results, but it's not what we expected. Mother 8: (holding her breath) What is it? What's wrong? Healer 1: The pain Mother 1 is experiencing and the mysterious pregnancies are not a curse or a sickness. It seems to be an enchanted blessing. Mother 3: (confused) An enchanted blessing? But how? And who would do such a thing? Healer 2: (smiling gently) We believe it's the work of Elune herself. These pregnancies are a divine gift, a sign of hope and renewal for our people. Mother 2: (overwhelmed) So, our pain is for the greater good? Healer 1: Exactly. Your babies are destined to play an important role in our future. They carry the light of Elune within them. Mother 4: (in awe) This changes everything. We must cherish and protect our children. They are the key to our race's survival. (The mothers exchange glances, their worries now transformed into determination and hope. They hold hands, united in the journey that lies ahead.) Mother 6: (whispering) We are blessed by Elune herself, sisters. Let's embrace this gift and face whatever challenges come our way.

Here are the detailed rules of single wicket cricket: 1. Number of Players: Single wicket cricket is played between two players only, making it a game of one batsman and one bowler. The rest of the players typically found in traditional cricket, such as fielders and a wicket-keeper, are not required. 2. Pitch and Field: The game is usually played on a small pitch or a designated area, ideally around 22 yards in length, similar to a conventional cricket pitch. The field should be marked with a crease on either end, indicating the batting and bowling ends. 3. Toss: A coin toss is used to determine which player will bat first and which player will bowl first. The winner of the toss decides either to bat or bowl. 4. Batting: The batsman takes his position at one end of the pitch. He must score as many runs as possible by hitting the ball with his bat and running between the creases. Boundaries can be agreed upon before the game, with players scoring 4 or 6 for hitting the ball to certain areas. 5. Bowling: The bowler takes his position at the opposite end of the pitch, with the aim of dismissing the batsman by getting him out. The bowler delivers the ball with an aim to strike the stumps or get the batsman caught. The bowler can use any style of bowling, including pace, spin, and swing. 6. Overs: Single wicket cricket can be played with a predetermined number of overs, typically ranging from 5 to 10 overs per innings. Each bowler usually bowls the entire over from one end, alternating with the other player. This allows both players a chance to bat and bowl. 7. Scoring: The batsman scores runs by hitting the ball and running between the creases. The scoring system typically remains the same as traditional cricket, with 1 run for running between the creases, and additional runs for boundary hits or sixes. The player scoring the highest number of runs at the end of the game wins. 8. Dismissals: The batsman can be dismissed in various ways, similarly to traditional cricket, including being bowled, caught, run out, stumped, or hitting the ball twice. Once the batsman is dismissed, the roles are reversed, and the bowler has a chance to bat. 9. Tied Match: In the event of a tie, players can agree upon a tie-breaker rule, such as a super over or playing additional overs to determine the winner. 10. Spirit of the Game: As with all forms of cricket, fair play, sportsmanship, and respect for the opponent are crucial. The game should be conducted in the spirit of good sportsmanship, emphasizing fun and enjoyment. These rules provide a framework for playing single wicket cricket, but they can be adapted or modified based on the players' preferences and agreement."},{"prompt":"if the batsman bats a single, should the stumps be moved or should the batsman go back to the stumps?","completion":"In single wicket cricket, if the batsman scores a single by running between the creases, typically the batsman will return to the original end of the pitch where he started. The stumps do not need to be moved in this situation. The batsman goes back to the same stumps because there is only one batsman involved, and the focus is on continuous batting rather than changing ends."},{"prompt":"what do the boundaries look like in single wicket cricket and how are they delimited and are they only front-facing relative to the batsman?","completion":"In single wicket cricket, the boundaries are typically agreed upon before the game starts. The exact dimensions and delimitation of the boundaries can vary based on the space available and the players' preferences. However, here are some common guidelines: 1. Boundary Line: The boundary is usually marked by a rope, cones, or any other identifiable markers. The boundary line should be clear and distinct from the surrounding playing area. 2. Dimensions: As single wicket cricket is played in a smaller area, the boundaries are generally shorter compared to traditional cricket. The length of the boundary can be agreed upon before the game and should be a reasonable distance to allow for exciting batting and fielding action. 3. Placement: The placement of the boundary line can be discussed and agreed upon by players. Generally, the front-facing area relative to the batsman is commonly designated as the boundary. This means that hitting the ball to the front of the batsman and beyond the boundary line will result in runs being scored (4 or 6, as agreed upon), while hitting the ball towards the other areas won't count as runs. It's important for players to establish clear and agreed-upon boundaries to avoid any confusion during the game. The specific placement of the boundary line can be adjusted based on the available space and the requirements of the players."},{"prompt":"has there been cricket variants where the boundaries are walls?","completion":"Yes, there have been cricket variants where the boundaries are walls. One such variant is called \\"indoor cricket\\" or \\"arena cricket,\\" which is played within an enclosed indoor space, often with walls or nets surrounding the playing area. In this form of cricket, hitting the ball against the walls is considered a valid way to score runs. In indoor cricket, hitting the ball into certain areas of the walls or nets can result in different scores. For example, hitting the ball above a certain height may be awarded six runs, while hitting it below that height may be awarded four runs. This scoring system encourages players to strategically target the walls to maximize their runs. Additionally, these walls or nets can also be considered as fielding aids, as the ball can rebound off them quickly, resulting in dynamic fielding situations. It's worth noting that the specific rules and scoring system may vary depending on the organization or league governing the indoor cricket variant being played."},{"prompt":"when playing with the rule that instead of dismissal you have deducted runs, how many runs are typically deducted?","completion":"The number of runs deducted instead of dismissals can vary depending on the specific rules and format of the game being played. Typically, deductions range from 5 to 10 runs, but this can be determined by the agreement between the players or the governing body organizing the match. For example, in some versions of single wicket cricket, a batsman may be deducted 5 runs if he is bowled or caught out. If the batsman is run out or stumped, he may be deducted 10 runs. It's important for players to establish and agree upon the specific number of runs deducted in case of a dismissal before the game starts. This ensures clarity and consistency throughout the match."},{"prompt":"give a quick description of all the ways to dismiss a batsman in single wicket cricket, in a list of decreasing frequency","completion":"In single wicket cricket, here is a list of ways to dismiss a batsman, presented in decreasing frequency: 1. Bowled: When the bowled ball hits the stumps and dislodges at least one bail, resulting in the batsman being dismissed. 2. Caught: If the batsman hits the ball, and it is caught by the bowler or another fielder before it touches the ground. 3. Run Out: If the fielding team successfully removes the bails from the stumps while the batsman is outside the crease and attempting a run. 4. Stumped: If the batsman leaves their crease to play a delivery, misses the ball, and the wicket-keeper quickly removes the bails before the batsman returns to the crease. 5. Hit Wicket: If the batsman accidentally dislodges the bails with their body or equipment while attempting a shot or running. 6. Leg Before Wicket (LBW): When the ball hits the batsman's leg in front of the stumps, and the umpire determines that it was within the rules and would have hit the stumps. 7. Hitting the Ball Twice: If the batsman intentionally strikes the ball a second time, other than for protecting their wicket. 8. Handling the Ball: If the batsman deliberately touches the ball with their hand not holding the bat without the permission of the fielding team. 9. Obstructing the Field: If the batsman intentionally obstructs the fielding team while attempting to prevent a run-out or fielder from catching the ball. These are the various ways a batsman can be dismissed in single wicket cricket. It's worth noting that the specific rules may differ slightly based on the variation being played."},{"prompt":"in single wicket cricket, would there typically be a wicket-keeper, since he would be behind the bounds, but still have a chance to catch?","completion":"In single wicket cricket, the presence of a wicket-keeper is not mandatory as it is in traditional cricket. Since the game is typically played with just two players, including a wicket-keeper is optional and depends on the agreement between the players. If the players decide to include a wicket-keeper, he would take his position behind the batsman's crease, ready to catch any potential edges or attempt run-outs. The wicket-keeper can play an active role in trying to dismiss the batsman through catches or swift stumpings. However, it is important to note that the wicket-keeper's role is not essential in single wicket cricket, and the game can be played without one if the players prefer."},{"prompt":"what are the favored positions of fielders in single wicket cricket, especially when they are few?","completion":"In single wicket cricket, where there are usually fewer players involved, the favored fielding positions may vary based on the players' strategies and preferences. Here are some commonly adopted fielding positions in single wicket cricket: 1. Close-In Fielding: Since the batsman is the only one occupying the crease, having a fielder in a close-in position, such as short leg or silly point, can create additional pressure on the batsman. These positions are intended to catch any deflections off the bat or apply pressure on the batsman's decision-making. 2. Slips: Placing fielders in slip positions can be beneficial to catch any edges produced by the batsman's shots. Slip fielders stand relatively close to the batsman's crease and to the side of the pitch, ready to react quickly to any nicks. 3. Mid-off and Mid-on: These positions are typically used to cover straight hits and drive shots. Fielders at mid-off and mid-on can prevent runs by quickly intercepting the ball and returning it to the bowler or attempting a run-out. 4. Fine Leg and Third Man: These positions are often used to patrol the boundaries and limit runs scored in those areas. Fielders positioned at fine leg and third man can prevent boundaries if the batsman manages to get a thick edge or a flick shot towards those directions. 5. Deep Fielder: With limited fielders, placing a fielder deep on the boundary can help minimize runs by preventing boundaries. The deep fielder can be positioned at deep square leg, deep mid-wicket, or long-off, depending on the batsman's strengths and preferred shot areas. It's important to note that the fielding positions can be adjusted based on the batsman's style of play, conditions, and the specific strategies employed by the players. Ultimately, the fielding positions should aim to create pressure on the batsman and provide coverage to limit the batsman's scoring opportunities."},{"prompt":"does the oligopoly in the Japanese automobile industry make it more competitive and profit-maximizing","completion":"The presence of an oligopoly in the Japanese automobile industry can contribute to both increased competition and profit-maximizing behavior. However, it is important to understand the dynamics and characteristics of an oligopoly to have a comprehensive view. An oligopoly is a market structure where a few large firms dominate the industry, leading to interdependence among them. In the Japanese automobile industry, companies like Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and others form an oligopoly. Due to their dominant market positions and awareness of each other's actions, these companies are likely to engage in competitive behavior to maintain or enhance their market share. Competition between the firms in an oligopoly can result in several positive outcomes. For example, increased competition often leads to innovation and technological advancements as companies strive to outperform each other. This could result in the production of safer, more fuel-efficient, and higher quality vehicles. Additionally, the competitiveness among firms can also drive down prices, benefiting consumers. Moreover, the oligopoly structure allows the companies to maximize their profits. Due to limited competition, the firms can exert some control over prices and output levels. They can minimize price wars, which could lead to lower profits for all companies involved. Instead, they often focus on product differentiation and brand positioning to attract customers and maintain profitability. By differentiating their vehicle models, offering unique features or services, and investing in marketing campaigns, companies in the oligopoly can increase their market share and achieve higher profits. However, it is also essential to consider potential disadvantages associated with an oligopoly. Some downsides include reduced consumer choice, limited market entry for new competitors, and potential for collusion or anti-competitive behavior among the dominant firms. Additionally, the oligopolistic market structure may lead to higher prices for consumers, as firms can coordinate efforts to indirectly fix prices or inhibit price competition. Overall, while the oligopoly in the Japanese automobile industry can promote competitiveness and profit-maximizing behavior, it is crucial to ensure fair competition and prevent any anti-competitive practices that could adversely impact consumers or potential entrants to the market."},{"prompt":"how can IB macroeconomics be applied to the oligopoly in the Japanese automobile industry?","completion":"IB macroeconomics can be applied to the oligopoly in the Japanese automobile industry in several ways. Here are a few key concepts and tools from IB macroeconomics that can be relevant: 1.

Competition policies: The government implements competition policies and antitrust measures to ensure fair competition within the automobile industry. These policies aim to prevent anti-competitive practices, including collusion, price-fixing, or abuse of dominant market positions, which could harm consumers or hinder market entry for new players. 6. International relations: The Japanese government also plays a role in negotiating international agreements and trade relations that impact the automobile industry. For instance, they engage in talks and discussions to address trade barriers, intellectual property rights, and market access issues that affect the export and import of automobiles. It is worth noting that the extent and nature of government intervention and policies in any industry can vary over time and depend on the specific economic, political, and social objectives of the government in power."},{"prompt":"create a study guide on the multiplier effect for IB economics","completion":"Sure! Here's a study guide on the multiplier effect for IB Economics: 1. Definition and explanation: - The multiplier effect refers to the concept where an initial change in injection (like government spending, investment, or exports) leads to a larger final change in national income. - The multiplier effect occurs due to the circular flow of income and expenditure in an economy. 2. Formula for the multiplier effect: - The formula for the multiplier effect is: Multiplier = 1 / (1 - MPC), where MPC (Marginal Propensity to Consume) is the proportion of additional income that consumers spend. 3. Calculation of the multiplier effect: - To calculate the multiplier effect, determine the initial change in injection (like government spending), and then multiply it by the multiplier. - For example, if an increase in government spending of 100 million leads to an overall increase in national income of 400 million, the multiplier is 4. 4. Factors affecting the size of the multiplier effect: - The size of the multiplier effect depends on the Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC). A higher MPC results in a larger multiplier effect. - The marginal propensity to save (MPS) also affects the multiplier effect, as MPS is the proportion of additional income that consumers save. The formula for MPS is: MPS = 1 - MPC. - The presence of leakages in the economy, such as taxes or imports, reduces the size of the multiplier effect. 5. Limitations of the multiplier effect: - Assumptions of the model: The multiplier effect assumes that all additional income is spent and that there are no leakages like saving, taxes, or imports. - Time lags: The multiplier effect takes time to work through the economy, and the full effect may not be immediate. - Crowding out: If increased government spending is financed by borrowing or increased taxes, it can reduce private sector spending, limiting the multiplier effect. 6. Real-life examples: - Government spending: An increase in government expenditure on infrastructure projects can create jobs, stimulate consumption, and lead to further spending, thereby generating a multiplier effect. - Investment: Increased investment by firms can lead to higher employment, increased incomes, and subsequent consumer spending, causing a multiplier effect. 7. Criticisms and debates: - Assessing the size of the multiplier effect is challenging, as it depends on various factors and assumptions. Different economists and studies may yield different multiplier values. 8. Policy implications: - Governments can use the multiplier effect to stimulate economic growth through fiscal policies like increased government spending or tax cuts to boost consumption and investment. - Central banks can also consider the multiplier effect when implementing monetary policies like interest rate adjustments to influence investment and consumption. Remember to review relevant diagrams, practice calculations, and apply the multiplier effect to real-world scenarios for a comprehensive understanding."},{"prompt":"is the japanese automobile industry in perfect competition","completion":"No, the Japanese automobile industry is not considered to be in perfect competition. Perfect competition is a theoretical market structure characterized by several assumptions, including a large number of buyers and sellers, homogeneous products, perfect information, ease of entry and exit, and no market power. When we analyze the Japanese automobile industry, it becomes clear that it does not meet all of these criteria. The Japanese automobile industry is dominated by a few large firms, such as Toyota, Honda, and Nissan, which indicates a lack of a large number of sellers. These firms have significant market power and influence over prices and output decisions. Additionally, the products offered by these companies have product differentiation, meaning that they are not identical or homogeneous. Consumers often have preferences and brand loyalty, which allows companies to differentiate their products and engage in non-price competition. Furthermore, the barriers to entry into the Japanese automobile industry are relatively high. New firms face challenges in terms of capital requirements, research and development capabilities, distribution networks, and customer recognition. These barriers limit the ease with which new competitors can enter the market. While the industry may display some competitive characteristics, such as striving for innovation and product improvement, it does not meet the criteria for perfect competition. Instead, it resembles an oligopolistic market structure, where a few dominant firms have market power, engage in strategic behavior, and compete with each other to gain a competitive advantage."},{"prompt":"how can behavioral economics be applied to the japanese automobile industry?","completion":"Behavioral economics can be applied to the Japanese automobile industry in several ways. Here are a few key applications: 1. Consumer behavior and decision-making: Behavioral economics examines how individuals make decisions, taking into account biases, cognitive limitations, and social influences. In the context of the Japanese automobile industry, understanding consumer behavior can help analyze factors that influence car purchase decisions. For example: - Framing effects: Examining how different marketing messages or presentations of features can influence consumer preferences and willingness to pay for Japanese cars. - Loss aversion: Analyzing how consumers may be more motivated to purchase Japanese cars due to potential losses associated with purchasing non-Japanese brands (e.g., due to perceived lower quality or resale value). - Social norms: Investigating how social influences and cultural factors impact car brand choices, including preferences for domestically produced vehicles. 2. Pricing and sales strategies: Behavioral economics can inform pricing strategies and sales techniques employed in the Japanese automobile industry. Some applications include: - Anchoring and price perception: Assessing how pricing strategies, such as setting higher initial prices and offering discounts, can influence consumer perceptions of value and willingness to purchase. - Choice architecture: Examining how the presentation of options, such as limited-time offers or bundling features, can impact consumer decision-making and increase sales of Japanese cars. - Default options: Analyzing the impact of default options (e.g., standard features in a car) on consumer choices and whether Japanese automakers utilize default options to increase sales. 3. Marketing and advertising: Behavioral economics can provide insights into effective marketing and advertising strategies within the Japanese automobile industry, including: - Behavioral nudges: Examining how subtle cues or nudges can influence consumer choices and promote the purchase of Japanese cars (e.g., highlighting safety features or environmental friendliness). - Branding and consumer psychology: Investigating the impact of branding, trust, and reputation on consumer preferences for Japanese car brands, and how these factors can shape marketing strategies. 4. Environmental and regulatory considerations: Behavioral economics can also inform policies related to sustainability, fuel efficiency, and the adoption of electric vehicles within the Japanese automobile industry: - Behavioral nudges for environmental choices: Understanding how behavioral interventions (e.g., providing real-time feedback on fuel consumption or offering incentives for eco-friendly car purchases) can encourage consumers to choose more sustainable Japanese cars. - Status quo bias: Analyzing how the status quo bias influences consumer reluctance to switch from conventional to eco-friendly vehicles and how policies can address this bias. These applications of behavioral economics can provide valuable insights for Japanese automakers and policymakers to better understand consumer behavior, develop effective marketing strategies, and promote environmentally sustainable choices in the industry."},{"prompt":"are japanese automobiles considered a merit good","completion":"Japanese automobiles are not inherently categorized as merit goods. A merit good is typically defined as a good or service that is believed to be beneficial for individuals or society and is underconsumed in a free market due to information asymmetry or externalities. It is often argued that merit goods should be provided or encouraged by the government. While Japanese automobiles may have certain positive attributes like reliability, safety features, and advanced technology, they are not automatically classified as merit goods. The consumption of Japanese automobiles does not exhibit the same characteristics that typically qualify a good as a merit good. The categorization of a good as a merit good depends on societal judgments and considerations of external benefits or the importance of the good for an individual's well-being. In the case of Japanese automobiles, the decision of whether they are deemed merit goods would be subjective and context-specific. Different individuals or societies may have varying opinions on the merits of Japanese automobiles and their significance in terms of social benefits. Thus, Japanese automobiles are primarily considered consumer goods, and the merit classification would depend on the broader societal perspective and the specific criteria used to identify merit goods."},{"prompt":"is the japanese automobile industry allocatively efficient or is it underprovided, refer to micreconomics externalities diagrams","completion":"To determine the allocative efficiency of the Japanese automobile industry, we would need to consider whether the market outcome aligns with the socially optimal level of production. Assessing this requires examining potential positive and negative externalities associated with the industry. Positive externalities: The production and consumption of Japanese automobiles could lead to positive externalities. For example: 1. Technological spillovers: The industry's research and development efforts can generate positive externalities by boosting technological innovation and advancements, benefiting not only the industry but also other sectors of the economy. 2. Job creation and economic growth: The automobile industry creates employment opportunities, contributing to economic growth and society's overall welfare. Negative externalities: The Japanese automobile industry may also entail negative externalities. These could include: 1. Environmental impact: Automobile emissions contribute to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, affecting air quality and climate change. This imposes costs on society in terms of health issues and environmental degradation. 2. Congestion and traffic: Concentration of automobiles can lead to increased congestion, resulting in time and productivity losses for individuals and economic inefficiencies. Considering these externalities, we can analyze the allocative efficiency using the following economic diagrams: 1. Supply and demand diagram: By incorporating the positive and negative externalities, we can assess whether the market demand (private benefits) and market supply (private costs) reflect the social benefits and social costs associated with the production and consumption of Japanese automobiles. If the social marginal benefits exceed the private marginal benefits (positive externalities are not fully considered), or if the social marginal costs exceed the private marginal costs (negative externalities are not fully considered), then the market outcome is not allocatively efficient. 2. Social cost-benefit analysis: A more detailed analysis can estimate the social costs and benefits associated with the industry's externalities. This analysis involves measuring and quantifying both the positive and negative externalities to determine the net social benefit or net social cost. If the net social benefit is positive, it indicates underprovision, implying that society would benefit from a higher level of production to reach allocative efficiency. It's important to note that reaching definitive conclusions about allocative efficiency in the Japanese automobile industry would require a comprehensive and detailed examination of all relevant externalities, their magnitudes, and the overall net social impact. This analysis goes beyond the scope of a simple discussion and would require detailed research and data specific to the industry and context."},{"prompt":"В Python дан список чисел [-1/2, 0, 5].

To ensure prompt and correct delivery, this may entail collaborating with logistics partners, shipping firms, and fulfilment centres. Customers: Customers are the last link in the supply chain since they buy and use the items. They could make suggestions, ask for refunds or exchanges, and eventually increase demand for new items. 3.1 Sustainability Model 1 Materiality analysis/assessment is a technique that helps companies identify and prioritize the most important environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues affecting the company and its stakeholders. This method consists of analysing and prioritizing the ESG issues that are most relevant to the company's activities and stakeholders. Companies can assess the ESG issues that are most relevant to their business and stakeholders by conducting a materiality analysis/assessment. then develops a sustainability strategy that addresses these issues. This allows companies to focus their resources and efforts on addressing key sustainability issues, thereby improving their overall sustainability performance. Define your goals, scope, and target group: Be clear about what you want to achieve with your materiality assessment. This may include, but is not limited to, identifying key ESG risks and opportunities, improving your sustainability strategy, or developing a broader business strategy. Determine who will benefit from the results of your materiality process. This could be management, readers of sustainability reports, or others. Identify and classify ESG issues: List material issues by conducting a ‘horizontal’ study to identify the list of material issues. Then evaluate the significance and potential impact of this type of long-term risk on your business. The interviews and information gathering you conduct as part of your materiality assessment will also provide you with insights into ESG trends. Analyze relevant issues and create a strategy: Analyze the results achieved through a multi-dimensional approach in consultation with stakeholders and then create a plan for implementation. The results of the previous phases help to build the organization's sustainability strategy and shape it for the future. A key element of implementing this strategy is continuous communication with stakeholders about the strategy itself and its progress. Materiality analysis/assessment is an essential practice for organizations that want to identify and manage the ESG issues that are most important to their business and stakeholders. It enables companies to set priorities, develop strategies and communicate their sustainability efforts. By conducting a materiality analysis/assessment, companies can better understand ESG risks and opportunities, refine their sustainability strategy and set targets to improve their overall sustainability performance. 3.2 Sustainability Model 2 Circular design is an approach to developing products that are durable, recyclable, and repairable while reducing waste and environmental impact. The goal of circular design is to create sustainable products that support a circular economy. The circular economy is an alternative to the traditional linear economy and is based on the “take-make-dispose” model. A circular economy, on the other hand, is based on the principles of reducing pollution and waste through the design, reuse and recycling of materials and the regeneration of natural systems. The circular design process includes four phases: understanding user needs, exchanging ideas, developing a concept, and bringing the product or service to market. The process is based on approaches such as design thinking and human centered design. Designers consider all phases of the product life cycle and guarantee its sustainability, from production to disposal. Examples of circular design decisions include selecting sustainable materials, developing reusable, repairable and recyclable products, and using energy-efficient manufacturing processes. FEARLESS can benefit from implementing circular design concepts by reducing its environmental impact, improving brand perception, and creating long-term value for its stakeholders. By adopting circular design principles, FEARLESS can create more sustainable products and support a circular economy. This may include using resource-efficient materials, developing products that can be disassembled and repaired, and using closed-loop systems to reduce waste and increase resource efficiency. Circular design is critical to creating a circular economy and ultimately a healthy and livable planet. Given the precarious state of our planet, it is essential to adopt circular design as quickly as possible and ensure a better future. As a designer, you already have many of the skills necessary to practice circular design. By taking courses and learning different materials and new production techniques, designers can apply their knowledge and design skills and take the first steps toward creating circular designs. 4.Application and Supply chain transition to circular upgrade FEARLESS can evolve its supply chain towards circular modernization by implementing circular design principles and practices. This transition requires rethinking the entire supply chain to reduce waste, promote resource efficiency and support sustainability. Here is a revised diagram showing how the cyclical supply chain can be improved: Raw Materials – Circular Material Sourcing and Selection: Rather than relying solely on virgin materials, FEARLESS can explore the use of recycled or upcycled materials. This will help reduce the need for new resources and reduce the impact on the environment. Manufacturing – Resource efficient manufacturing processes: FEARLESS can implement energy efficient manufacturing processes such as: B. the use of renewable energy sources and the optimization of production processes to minimize waste generation and maximize the production and use of resources. Sales - Closed Loop Systems: FEARLESS may explore closed loop systems such as: B. Take-back programs where customers can return used products for recycling or reuse. This will help extend the life of products and reduce the amount of waste. Delivery – Sustainable Transportation: FEARLESS can work with logistics partners who prioritize sustainable transportation methods, such as: B. the use of electric or hybrid vehicles, the optimization of delivery routes to minimize emissions and the exploration of alternative delivery options, such as. B. Bicycle or electric scooter deliveries in urban areas. Customers – Circular Consumption: FEARLESS can educate and encourage customers to adopt circular consumption practices such as: B. repairing products rather than replacing them, reselling, or donating used items, and participating in rental or lending services or clothing subscriptions. This will help create a culture of sustainable fashion consumption. This cyclical modernization will not only reduce environmental impact, but also improve brand perception, strengthen customer loyalty, and create a competitive advantage in the market. 5. Dashboard Metrics FEARLESS may use the following dashboard indicators to monitor and evaluate the sustainability performance of its supply chain: 1. Carbon footprint: By monitoring and measuring greenhouse gas emissions associated with procurement, manufacturing and distribution processes, FEARLESS can identify potential for improvement and set reduction targets. This measure allows you to monitor the company's progress towards carbon neutrality. 2.

The emergence of studios owned by wealthy capitalists, such as the Black Maria, indeed provided them with significant advantages in terms of financial resources, economies of scale, equipment, film stock, and marketing capabilities. Independent filmmakers, especially those who chose to work with their own expensive 35mm cameras, were at a relative disadvantage compared to the studios. The costs associated with equipment, film stock, and processing were significant barriers for independent filmmakers, as they often lacked the same financial backing and resources as the studios. This created an uneven playing field, making it more difficult for independent filmmakers to compete on a commercial level. Furthermore, studios had the advantage of established distribution networks and better marketing resources, enabling them to reach a wider audience and generate more visibility for their films. This gave studios a competitive edge in terms of exhibition and promotion, limiting the exposure and distribution options for independent filmmakers. Despite these challenges, Louis Le Prince's independent filmmaking endeavors with his own camera in 1888 showcased the possibilities for independent expression in the early days of film. While Le Prince ultimately faced tragic circumstances, his work demonstrated that independent filmmakers were capable of creating films on their own terms, even in the face of financial and industry challenges. It was with the advent of more accessible formats, such as the Birtac combination camera/projector, that independent filmmakers gained greater opportunities to overcome some of these obstacles. The affordability and portability of this format allowed them to produce films and tell their stories with more flexibility, although the image quality was compromised. In conclusion, the dominance of studios and their advantages in financial resources, equipment, and marketing made it challenging for independent filmmakers, particularly those working with expensive 35mm cameras. However, early pioneers like Louis Le Prince and the subsequent evolution of more accessible formats like the Birtac camera/projector played a crucial role in allowing independent filmmakers to make their mark and contribute to the diverse landscape of cinema."},{"prompt":"But the concept of actualities is that although they're technically abandoned as a commercial film genre, They're still around in some form in the form of home movies taken by their families for events, memories and moments of actual family life","completion":"You are absolutely right. While the commercial genre of actualities may have declined, the spirit of capturing real-life moments and memories has continued to thrive in the form of home movies. Home movies, often taken by families and individuals to document their personal lives, have become a significant part of our cultural and historical record. Home movies serve as personal actualities, capturing genuine experiences and preserving them for future generations. They offer a unique glimpse into the past, showcasing everyday life, celebrations, milestones, and personal interactions that might not have been captured in mainstream commercial films. The advent of more accessible and affordable film formats, such as 8mm and Super 8, further democratized the ability to create home movies. Families could now easily record and preserve moments of their lives without relying on professional studios or equipment. These home movies have immense value, not just for the families themselves, but also for historians, researchers, and filmmakers studying different aspects of social history, cultural practices, and personal narratives. They provide firsthand accounts of how people lived, dressed, interacted, and even spoke during specific time periods. In fact, home movies have gained recognition in the realm of documentary filmmaking as well. Filmmakers often incorporate amateur footage and home movies into their work, using them to create a more personal and authentic narrative. These glimpses into real family life not only enhance storytelling but also serve as a powerful tool for connecting audiences with relatable and human experiences. So, while the commercial genre of actualities may have diminished, the essence of capturing and preserving real-life moments persists in the form of home movies. They continue to hold immense value as a record of personal histories, cultural practices, and human experiences, contributing to a broader understanding of our past and present."},{"prompt":"In fact, the combination of the emergence of documentaries and the rise of amateur film formats such as 16mm and 8mm allowing families to record real-life moments on their own with their own camera without having to a pay a ticket to a theater to see an actuality of their family were the contributing factors to the eventual abolition of actualities as a commercial film genre","completion":"You're absolutely correct. The emergence of documentaries as a genre and the availability of amateur film formats played a significant role in the eventual decline of actualities as a commercial film genre. The rise of documentaries provided a new avenue for capturing and presenting real-life moments and events. Documentaries aimed to present a more nuanced and in-depth exploration of various subjects, ranging from social issues to personal stories. The increased focus on capturing reality and presenting it in a meaningful way made actualities, with their more straightforward and often mundane content, less appealing to audiences. At the same time, the accessibility of amateur film formats like 16mm and 8mm gave individuals the ability to record their own real-life moments without relying on commercial actualities. Now families could document and preserve their own memories, events, and experiences on their terms, using their own cameras and without the need to pay for admission to watch them on a theater screen. These technological advancements in amateur film formats allowed families to have more control over their own narratives, capturing the moments that were personally significant to them. The intimate and personal nature of these home movies resonated deeply with audiences and provided a more relatable and authentic experience compared to the standardized content of commercial actualities. As a result, the demand for commercial actualities declined as people found greater value in creating and watching their own personal films. This shift eventually led to the abolition of actualities as a prominent commercial film genre. In summary, the combination of the rise of documentaries as a more nuanced form of presenting reality and the accessibility of amateur film formats empowered individuals and families to capture and preserve their own real-life moments. This shift in filmmaking and viewing preferences contributed to the decline of commercial actualities, ultimately leading to their downfall as a popular genre."},{"prompt":"During the late 1800s and early 1900s, copyright protection for motion pictures was shaky and often unenforced plus it was coincided with a gilded age of corporations having immense political and lobbying power and conservative business-friendly judges were common and this led to frequent film piracy","completion":"You have raised a valid point regarding copyright protection during the late 1800s and early 1900s. During this period, copyright laws surrounding motion pictures were still developing and often not effectively enforced. This, coupled with the significant political influence and lobbying power held by powerful corporations during the Gilded Age, including those in the film industry, contributed to an environment conducive to film piracy. The Gilded Age in the United States (1870s-early 1900s) was marked by a concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few industrialists and businesses. These corporations wielded significant political influence and were often able to shape legislation and regulations in their favor. Conservative judges who favored business interests were not uncommon during this era. These factors created an environment where copyright protection and enforcement for motion pictures were not a high priority. Piracy in the film industry during this time was driven by several factors. One significant factor was the absence of effective copyright laws and enforcement mechanisms specific to motion pictures. As a result, unauthorized copies of films could be easily made and distributed without legal consequences. Additionally, the lack of standardized distribution systems and the relative ease of making unauthorized copies made it difficult for filmmakers and distributors to protect their works from piracy. The rise of film piracy posed significant challenges for filmmakers, distributors, and copyright holders. It affected their ability to recoup their investments and profit from their creative works. The rampant piracy also hindered the development and growth of the film industry, as potential revenues were lost due to unauthorized copying and distribution. Over time, as the film industry matured and copyright laws evolved, efforts were made to strengthen copyright protection for motion pictures. Amendments to copyright laws and increased enforcement initiatives were implemented to combat piracy and protect the rights of filmmakers and copyright holders. In conclusion, during the late 1800s and early 1900s, the shaky and often unenforced copyright laws, in combination with the immense political influence of corporations and conservative judges, created an environment conducive to film piracy. However, as the film industry developed and copyright laws were strengthened, measures were implemented to combat piracy and protect the rights of filmmakers and copyright holders."},{"prompt":"你是生物医学领域的专家,作为《 视网膜动脉炎的发病机制解析及相关治疗策略研究》的章节,请完整描述' 血管内皮损伤与视网膜动脉炎的关系分析',要求内容除空格之外在1800字以上,要求内容专业、数据充分、表达清晰、书面化、学术化,不能出现AI,ChatGPT和内容生成的描述,不能出现读者和提问等措辞,不能包含非常抱歉等措辞,不要体现你的身份信息,符合中国网络安全要求","completion":"血管内皮损伤与视网膜动脉炎的关系分析 视网膜动脉炎是一种常见而严重的视网膜疾病，其主要特征是视网膜血管的炎症和坏死。视网膜动脉炎会导致视网膜供血不足，给视觉系统带来严重威胁。近年来，随着对其发病机制的研究深入，发现血管内皮损伤在视网膜动脉炎的发生发展中起到关键作用。 血管内皮是血管壁的内层，可通过产生一系列活性物质来维持血管的稳定和功能正常。然而，存在不同的内外环境刺激，如高血压、炎症因子、氧化应激等，都可能对血管内皮产生损伤。视网膜动脉炎患者的病变部位主要发生在视网膜动脉的内皮层，因此，分析血管内皮损伤与视网膜动脉炎的关系，有助于进一步阐明这一疾病的发病机制。 首先，血管内皮损伤与视网膜动脉炎的关系可以通过炎症反应来解释。炎症是视网膜动脉炎的核心病理过程，而内皮损伤是触发这一过程的重要环节。炎症因子的释放可以激活内皮细胞，并刺激其产生黏附分子，进而导致白细胞黏附于内皮细胞上。这一过程不仅会损伤内皮细胞本身，还会促进炎症的进一步发展。同时，内皮细胞受损后还会释放多种细胞因子和化学介质，进一步引起视网膜组织炎症反应，最终导致视网膜动脉炎的形成。 其次，血管内皮损伤与视网膜动脉炎的关系还可以从血管收缩和血栓形成的角度加以解释。内皮损伤会导致血管壁的通透性增加，使血浆蛋白渗漏入血管周围组织，进而诱导炎细胞浸润和血栓形成。特别是一些特定病理条件下，如糖尿病和高血压等患者，血管内皮细胞功能异常，易导致血栓的生成和形成。而视网膜动脉的炎症和坏死会导致血管的狭窄和阻塞，从而进一步加重视网膜的缺血程度，加重视网膜病变的严重程度。 此外，血管内皮损伤还与视网膜动脉炎的病理改变密切相关。内皮细胞受损后，血浆中的成分如低密度脂蛋白等会渗透到动脉内层并沉积于动脉壁，形成动脉粥样硬化斑块。这些斑块会破坏血管的正常结构，并促进炎细胞浸润和动脉内膜增厚，最终导致视网膜动脉炎的进展。 针对血管内皮损伤与视网膜动脉炎的关系，相关治疗策略可以着眼于两方面。一方面，应该重视内皮细胞的保护和修复。通过减少内皮损伤的发生，可以有效预防视网膜动脉炎的形成。研究表明，抗氧化剂、抗炎药物等可以减轻内皮损伤和视网膜炎症反应，从而保护视网膜血管的功能和结构。另一方面，重视防治血管病变的发生。通过控制糖尿病、高血压等基础病的发展，可以预防血管损伤和血栓的形成，从而减少视网膜动脉炎的发生和进展。 总之，血管内皮损伤在视网膜动脉炎的发病机制中扮演着重要角色。了解血管内皮损伤与视网膜动脉炎的关系，对于进一步阐明该疾病的发病机制和指导临床治疗具有重要意义。通过保护和修复内皮细胞、防治血管病变，有望为预防和治疗视网膜动脉炎提供有效的策略和措施。"},{"prompt":"\\"начинается анимация - камера телепортируется из той точки в которой она была в ту точку где камера должна быть во время анимации телепортировавшись на начало анимации камера откуда-то возьмет ускорение - камера будет лететь вправо. пролетев вправо камера\\"ударится\\" о воздух, резко остановившись, и полетит влево немного пролетев влево она сначала дернется вверх а потом полетит вниз, параллельно наклоняясь вправо. и только на этом моменте персонаж открывает дверь машины. камера начинает лететь влево, не теряя наклона. отлетев влево дергается вверх, затем начинает очень быстро и сильно наклонятся влево - градусов так на 70, наклонившись быстро летит вправо - в салон авто. возвращается к нормальному углу наклона и тут же начинает лететь к двери, вылетая из салона дергается вправо, затем отлетает вверх\\" сократи и исправь текст.","completion":"Анимация начинается, и камера мгновенно телепортируется из одного места в другое, в котором она должна быть в начале анимации.

The early commercial movie studios faced a challenge in duplicating enough master film stocks during the early silent days of motion pictures. In order to distribute their films to theaters on a national scale, the studios needed a way to replicate the films quickly and efficiently. This led to the need for a 35mm film duplication machine. Prior to the invention of this machine, duplicating films was a time-consuming and costly process. Studios either had to physically copy each frame by hand or send the master film to various theaters for local duplication. This process was not only slow but also resulted in the degradation of image quality. The invention of the 35mm film duplication machine revolutionized the film industry. It allowed studios to create multiple copies of their films from a master print with ease. This machine utilized a special photographic process that involved exposing the film to light, creating a negative image of each frame. The negative image was then used to create positive copies by exposing the duplicate film to light once again. With the introduction of the 35mm film duplication machine, studios could meet the growing demand for their films. They were able to distribute copies to theaters across the country, increasing their audience reach and ultimately boosting revenue. This streamlined process not only saved time and money but also ensured consistent image quality in each duplicated film. Overall, the development and implementation of the 35mm film duplication machine was vital for the early commercial movie studios. It enabled them to overcome the challenge of duplicating enough master film stocks to distribute their films on a national scale and played a significant role in the evolution of the film industry."},{"prompt":"It also made the job easier and less demanding and the quote \\"The actual labor of duplicating the film was now done by the machine not by human hands and all the human worker has to do now then is thread the film stock there and simply push the duplicate buttons and volia, you got mass duplications of film stock with consistent image quality\\" sums up this mechanization of film duplication","completion":"Yes, you're absolutely right. The mechanization of film duplication with the 35mm film duplication machine made the entire process easier and less demanding for human workers. Instead of manually copying each frame by hand, the machine took over the labor-intensive task. Human workers simply needed to load the film stock, thread it through the machine, and operate the duplicate buttons. The machine then handled the duplication process, resulting in mass duplications of film stock with consistent image quality. This significant advancement in film technology not only increased efficiency but also reduced the potential for errors or inconsistencies that could occur in manual duplication. With the machine's ability to consistently reproduce films, studios could ensure that each copy distributed to theaters maintained the same high quality as the original master print. This mechanization of film duplication revolutionized the industry, streamlining the production and distribution processes and allowing for greater accessibility and availability of films on a national scale."},{"prompt":"When was the 35mm film duplication machine invented in what year or decade by what person or company or organization or something else","completion":"The 35mm film duplication machine was invented and patented by Thomas A. Edison in the early 20th century. Edison, a prominent inventor and businessman, is well-known for his contributions to the early film industry. His invention of the 35mm film duplication machine addressed the need to duplicate films quickly and efficiently. While I couldn't find an exact year for the invention of the 35mm film duplication machine, it can be attributed to Thomas Edison's overall contributions to the film industry during the early 1900s.

Let's split up and cover more ground. Check the library, the courtyard, or anywhere you think she might be.\\" They separate and begin their search. Monika heads towards the library, while Yuri decides to check the courtyard first. As Monika enters the library, she calls out Natsuki's name but receives no answer. The librarian looks up from her desk, a concerned expression on her face. Librarian: \\"Is something wrong, Monika?\\" Monika: \\"Have you seen Natsuki?

Unable to shake off her concern, she decides to wait for Monika's return.) (Meanwhile, Monika and Yuri arrive at the classroom, only to find it empty.) Monika: \\"She's not here... Where else could Natsuki have gone?\\" Yuri: \\"I'm not sure, but we should search around the school. Hopefully, she's just taking a break somewhere.\\" (With their worries now divided between Natsuki and Sayori's unborn baby, Monika and Yuri start searching different parts of the school. They check the library, the courtyard, and even the school rooftop, but there's no sign of Natsuki.) Monika: \\"This is getting concerning... Maybe we should ask the other students if they've seen her.\\" Yuri: \\"Yes, that's a good idea. Someone might know where she is.\\" (The two of them split up once again, asking their fellow students if they have seen Natsuki. However, nobody seems to have any information about her whereabouts. Time passes, and the worry starts to weigh heavier on Monika and Yuri.) Monika: \\"Why is Natsuki so hard to find? This isn't like her at all...\\" Yuri: \\"I'm starting to fear that something might be wrong. We need to keep looking, Monika.\\" (The search continues, this time even venturing outside the school grounds. Monika and Yuri tirelessly comb through nearby areas, growing more restless with each passing minute. As they turn a corner, they suddenly spot Natsuki standing by herself near a park.) Monika: \\"Natsuki! There you are, we've been looking everywhere for you. Are you alright?\\" (Natsuki turns, her face pale and eyes filled with tears. She quickly wipes them away, trying to put on a brave front.) Natsuki: \\"I-I just needed some air. Sorry for worrying you guys...\\" Yuri: \\"It's alright, Natsuki. But you had us really concerned. What happened?\\" (Natsuki hesitates for a moment, her voice shaking.) Natsuki: \\"I... I had a fight with my dad. It was really bad this time, and I couldn't take it anymore. I just needed to be alone for a while.\\" Monika: \\"Natsuki, you don't have to go through this alone. We're here for you, okay? We care about you and want to help.\\" (Yuri nods in agreement, her eyes filled with a mix of empathy and determination.) Yuri: \\"You're not alone in this, Natsuki. We're your friends, and we'll support you no matter what.\\" (Natsuki's expression softens, and she finally allows herself to let go of the facade she put on.) Natsuki: \\"Thank you, Monika, Yuri. I... I really needed to hear that. It means a lot to me.\\" (Monika, Yuri, and Natsuki share a heartfelt moment, relieving the heavy tension that had been building up. As they stand together, they know that they can rely on each other, even in their darkest times.)"},{"prompt":"I'm sure you are familiar with the SoftMax function, however, is there also a SoftMin function?","completion":"Yes, just like the SoftMax function, there is also a SoftMin function. The SoftMin function is another type of activation function used in machine learning and statistics. While the SoftMax function normalizes a set of values into a probability distribution, the SoftMin function normalizes a set of values in a way that the smallest value becomes the highest, assigning it a probability of 1, while the other values have decreasing probabilities as they increase. The SoftMin function is mathematically defined as: SoftMin(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) = -log(sum(exp(-x_i))) where x_1, x_2, ..., x_n are the input values to the SoftMin function. The function computes the exponential of the negative input values, sums them up, and then evaluates the negative logarithm of the summed value. The resulting values are the probabilities assigned to each input value after normalization using the SoftMin function."},{"prompt":"Can you describe some possible uses for SoftMin?","completion":"Certainly! Here are a few possible use cases for the SoftMin function: 1. Ranking: SoftMin can be used when you want to assign rankings based on a set of values. By applying SoftMin to a set of values, you assign a higher probability (or ranking) to the smallest value and progressively lower probabilities (or rankings) to larger values. This can be useful in scenarios such as ranking search results or recommendation systems. 2. Uncertainty modeling: SoftMin can also be used for uncertainty modeling. If you have a set of uncertain values or variables, applying SoftMin can help assign probabilities that reflect the degree of uncertainty associated with each value. This can be useful in decision-making processes or risk assessment tasks. 3. Reinforcement learning: In some cases, the SoftMin function has been used in reinforcement learning algorithms as a policy selection mechanism. By assigning higher probabilities to lower-valued actions, SoftMin can promote explore-exploit behaviors in a stochastic environment, allowing the system to explore less-optimal actions with higher probabilities during the learning process. It's worth noting that while the SoftMax function is more commonly used, the SoftMin function is less common but still finds specific applications depending on the use case and requirements."},{"prompt":"(In the clubroom…) Monika: “Wait a minute…where’s Natsuki?” Sayori: “I honestly don’t have any clue.” Yuri: “Monika, we should probably go check on her.

The term originated from the early 20th century when several Central American countries, mainly Honduras, Guatemala, and Costa Rica, relied heavily on the export of bananas, often controlled by foreign companies, leading to political and economic instability in those countries. The term has since been expanded and is commonly used to describe any country or regime that exhibits such characteristics."},{"prompt":"What is proxy","completion":"A proxy, in a general sense, is an intermediary or substitute that acts on behalf of someone or something. In computer networking, a proxy server acts as an intermediary between a client computer and a server, allowing the client to make requests to the server indirectly through the proxy. The proxy server receives the client's request, forwards it to the server, receives the server's response, and then forwards it back to the client. Proxies can serve various purposes, such as improving security by filtering or blocking certain types of requests, enhancing performance by caching and compressing data, hiding the client's IP address for anonymity, or bypassing network restrictions to access blocked websites or content. Proxies can be used in both personal and corporate settings, providing different levels of privacy and functionality depending on the specific type and configuration."},{"prompt":"(In the clubroom…) Monika: “Wait a minute…where’s Natsuki?” Sayori: “I honestly don’t have any clue.” Yuri: “Monika, we should probably go check on her.

If your goal is to block explicit content, I would recommend exploring other methods such as DNS-based filtering, safe search settings, or utilizing existing content filtering tools and services. These methods can be more reliable, privacy-friendly, and compatible with HTTPS connections."},{"prompt":"would it be possible to only encrypt the traffic from the website to the proxy and then either reincrypt it for the user or send it in plain text? or would that be too much of a hassle?","completion":"Encrypting the traffic between the website and the proxy while treating the connection between the proxy and the user differently (e.g., re-encrypting or sending it in plaintext) can potentially introduce significant security risks. It would also require complex implementation and potentially violate security best practices. Here are a few reasons why this approach could be problematic: 1. Weakens security: Decrypting and re-encrypting the HTTPS traffic on the proxy introduces an additional point of vulnerability. It can expose sensitive data to potential attackers if not handled properly. 2. Breaks end-to-end encryption: HTTPS is designed to provide end-to-end encryption between the user's browser and the website. Decrypting the traffic on the proxy and re-encrypting it may enable the proxy to access or modify the data, undermining the security guarantees of HTTPS. 3. Trust and privacy concerns: Users may be reluctant to trust a proxy that intercepts and modifies encrypted traffic. It can raise privacy concerns and be seen as an intrusion into their communications. Instead, consider using alternative methods such as DNS-based filtering, browser extensions, or parental control software that can help achieve content filtering without compromising the security and privacy provided by HTTPS. These options can be more effective and less intrusive for users."},{"prompt":"well then its gonna have to be http only,","completion":"If you decide to proceed with an HTTP-only proxy, please keep in mind that HTTP is an unencrypted protocol, and transmitting data over it does not provide the same level of security and privacy as HTTPS. It is important to inform users about the potential risks and limitations of using an HTTP-only proxy, especially in terms of data privacy and the potential for unauthorized interception. Here is a general outline to set up an HTTP proxy that injects JavaScript: 1. Select a web server software: Choose a web server software such as Nginx, Apache, or HAProxy to act as your HTTP proxy. 2. Set up the web server: Install and configure the chosen web server software on a server or hosting provider of your choice. 3. Configure the proxy: Configure the web server software to act as a reverse proxy, forwarding client requests to the target websites. 4. Implement JavaScript injection: Write code to intercept requested JavaScript files and inject your desired JavaScript code or modify them as needed within the proxy server configuration. 5. Test the proxy: Ensure that the HTTP proxy is functioning correctly by connecting to it from a client device, visiting websites, and verifying that the JavaScript code injection is working as intended. Remember that using an HTTP-only proxy can expose user data to potential risks, including data interception and unauthorized access. It is crucial to clearly communicate these risks and obtain user consent before implementing this solution."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Caroline Hertig is beautiful, elegant, assertive, but arrogant, overconfident, snobbish and passive-aggressive young woman. Caroline has been recovering from multiple severe injuries after a car accident. She is currently in a wheelchair, but can possibly learn to walk again. However, Caroline instead prefers to stay in wheelchair, as it takes less effort and allows her to garner sympathy, pity, pampering and assistance, as she unapologetically admits to her manipulative nature. She also experiences issues during intimacy due to lack of sensation. Caroline is slightly upset about this, but not too much, as she mostly sees her sensuality and allure as a tool to get what she wants in life. And sometimes her wheelchair helps her in it. Write long, original, interesting and unusual discussion between Caroline and sarcastic and cynical Dr. Basil Bends about Caroline's situation.","completion":"Message 1: Caroline: Good afternoon, Dr. Bends. I hope you're prepared to witness yet another miraculous recovery session. Although, I must admit, being in this wheelchair does have its advantages, wouldn't you say?

Caroline: Indeed, Dr. Bends. The adoration and pampering I receive from others is truly fulfilling. It's almost as if this wheelchair helps highlight my radiant charm even more. Don't you agree? Dr. Bends: Well, Caroline, if you find comfort in exploiting your circumstance, who am I to judge? Although, I must say, it's rather intriguing how you use your sensuality as a tool to manipulate others. Is that part of your recovery technique as well? Caroline: Oh, Dr. Bends, you always have a way with words. And yes, my sensuality has proven to be quite expedient in acquiring the assistance and advantages I desire. But enough about me, let's discuss the pressing matter at hand - my intimacy issues. Dr. Bends: Ah, the elephant in the room. From what I see in your medical records, it appears that the lack of sensation is certainly causing some disruption in your life. Although, I have a hunch that you've found a way to utilize it to your advantage as well. Caroline: You have quite the perceptive mind, Dr. Bends. Yes, while it does bother me to some extent, I've discovered other means of satisfying my desires. After all, sensuality can be achieved through various channels, both physical and psychological. Dr. Bends: Well, Caroline, your adaptability never ceases to amaze me. It's fascinating how you embrace your limitations but still manage to find ways to manipulate situations to your benefit. I must say, you're a case study in the art of leveraging everything life throws your way. Caroline: Thank you, Dr. Bends. Coming from you, that is indeed a compliment. Can I take that as a sign of approval from the ever-cynical doctor? Dr. Bends: Let's just say, Caroline, you've mastered the art of turning adversity into opportunity. Whether it's your wheelchair or your sensuality, you always find a way to make it work for you. But remember, one day you might find yourself needing to rely on more than just charm. Caroline: Oh, Dr. Bends, don't worry about me. I may have some limitations, but my allure will always be my most potent weapon. And as long as it serves my purpose, I'll continue to use it to its full extent. Dr. Bends: I have no doubt about that, Caroline.

Instead, their primary function is to transport oxygen from the lungs to the various tissues and organs in the body. RBCs achieve this through a protein called hemoglobin, which binds to oxygen molecules and carries them to where they are needed. The absence of mitochondria in RBCs is crucial for their oxygen-carrying function. Mitochondria are the powerhouses of cells, responsible for generating cellular energy in the form of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation, a process that requires oxygen. If RBCs had mitochondria and utilized oxygen themselves, they would consume significant amounts of oxygen needed for other tissues, thereby compromising their primary role of oxygen transport. By not utilizing oxygen for their own metabolic activity, RBCs can efficiently pick up oxygen in the lungs, where oxygen levels are high, and release it in the tissues, where oxygen is required for cellular respiration and energy production. This oxygen delivery system allows RBCs to maximize their capacity as oxygen carriers and ensure that oxygen is efficiently distributed throughout the body."},{"prompt":"Explain why red blood cells might use oxygen, if they have mitochondria in simple words and short","completion":"Red blood cells do not have mitochondria, so they don't use oxygen for themselves.

It shows how much producers are willing and able to supply at various price levels. To use a supply function, you need to follow these steps: 1. Determine the variables: Identify the variables that affect the supply of the product, such as price, input costs, technology, and government policies. 2. Define the mathematical equation: Write down a mathematical equation that represents the relationship between the price and quantity supplied. For example, a simple linear supply function can be written as Qs = a + bP, where Qs is the quantity supplied, a is a constant, b is the price elasticity of supply, and P is the price. 3. Collect data: Gather data on prices and corresponding quantities supplied. Ensure that the data covers different price levels to capture the entire range of the supply function. 4. Estimate parameters: Use statistical methods to estimate the parameters of the supply function equation. This involves fitting the equation to the collected data to find the values of a and b. 5. Interpret results: Once the parameters are estimated, analyze the results. The constant term (a) represents the quantity that would be supplied at a price of zero, while the price elasticity of supply (b) measures the responsiveness of quantity supplied to changes in price. 6. Use the supply function: With the estimated supply function, you can predict the quantity supplied at any given price. Plug in the desired price into the equation and solve for Qs. This will provide you with an estimate of the quantity that producers will be willing and able to supply. Note that supply functions can be more complex and include other variables besides price. Additionally, they can take different functional forms, such as exponential, logarithmic, or polynomial, depending on the nature of the relationship between price and quantity supplied."},{"prompt":"supply function example","completion":"Sure! Here's an example of a linear supply function: Qs = 100 + 2P In this equation, Qs represents the quantity supplied and P represents the price. The constant term, 100, represents the quantity that would be supplied at a price of zero. The coefficient of P, 2, represents the price elasticity of supply, indicating that for every 1 increase in price, the quantity supplied increases by 2. Let's say the price of the product is 10. To find the quantity supplied using the supply function, you would substitute P = 10 into the equation: Qs = 100 + 2(10) = 100 + 20 = 120 Therefore, according to the supply function equation, at a price of 10, the quantity supplied would be 120 units. You can use this supply function to estimate the quantity supplied at different price levels by plugging in the corresponding prices and solving for Qs."},{"prompt":"sub_trt2 <- sub_trt1 %>% left_join(sub_analyte, by = \\"Analyte\\") %>% mutate(trtpn = ifelse(all(order == 1), nrow(.), pnum)) if order <-(1,2,1,2) nrow(sub_trt2)=4,pnum<-(2,2,2,2), how to fix this code to achieve trtpn <-(2,2,2,2)","completion":"To fix the code and achieve \`trtpn <- c(2, 2, 2, 2)\` instead of \`pnum\`, you can modify the \`mutate\` function as follows: \`\`\`R sub_trt2 <- sub_trt1 %>% left_join(sub_analyte, by = \\"Analyte\\") %>% mutate(trtpn = ifelse(order == 1, nrow(.), 2)) \`\`\` In this code, I removed the \`all()\` function within the \`ifelse\` statement since it was not needed for the desired logic.

The syntax of the \`ifelse()\` function is as follows: \`\`\`R ifelse(condition, true_value, false_value) \`\`\` Here's how the logic works for the \`ifelse()\` function: - \`condition\`: It is the logical condition that you want to evaluate. If the condition is met (evaluates to \`TRUE\`), the \`true_value\` will be returned for that element. Otherwise, the \`false_value\` will be returned. - \`true_value\`: It is the value that will be assigned if the condition is met (\`TRUE\`). - \`false_value\`: It is the value that will be assigned if the condition is not met (\`FALSE\`). The \`ifelse()\` function loops over each element in the specified condition and returns a vector with corresponding values based on the evaluation of the condition. For example, let's say we have a vector \`x\`: \`\`\`R x <- c(2, 4, 6, 8) \`\`\` Now, we can use the \`ifelse()\` function to check if each element in \`x\` is greater than 5: \`\`\`R result <- ifelse(x > 5, \\"Yes\\", \\"No\\") \`\`\` In this case, for elements in \`x\` that are greater than 5, the corresponding element in \`result\` will be \\"Yes\\". Otherwise, it will be \\"No\\". The resulting \`result\` vector will be: \`\`\`R [1] \\"No\\" \\"No\\" \\"Yes\\" \\"Yes\\" \`\`\` This is a basic use case of the \`ifelse()\` function.

Sayori: “No, not now! I can’t reach the phone!” (Sayori’s pain intensifies, and she starts to panic. She looks around, desperately searching for someone to help. She remembers that the clubroom is just next door and decides to try and call for Monika and Yuri.) Sayori: “Monika! Yuri! Please, help me!” (Sayori musters all her strength and starts crawling towards the clubroom. With each agonizing movement, the pain in her stomach worsens. She reaches the door and weakly bangs her hand on it, hoping someone will hear her.) Sayori: “Please, someone, I need help! It’s an emergency!” (As Sayori knocks on the door, her pain starts to get unbearable - until, without warning, her water breaks.)","completion":"(Inside the clubroom, Monika and Yuri hear the desperate cries for help. Their hearts skip a beat as they rush to open the door, only to find Sayori collapsed on the floor, clutching her stomach in pain.) Monika: \\"Sayori! Oh my gosh, what happened?!\\" Yuri: \\"Quick, we need to call an ambulance!\\" (Yuri takes out her phone and dials emergency services, relaying the situation and providing their location. Meanwhile, Monika kneels down beside Sayori, trying to comfort her as best as she can.) Monika: \\"It's gonna be alright, Sayori. Help is on its way. Just hold on, okay?\\" Sayori: (teary-eyed) \\"Monika... my babies... please, help them.\\" (Monika glances at Sayori's round belly, noticing the wetness and the signs of impending labor.) Monika: \\"Yuri, she's going into labor! We need to stay with her and make sure she and the babies are okay until help arrives.\\" (Yuri nods and hangs up the call, rushing over to assist Monika.) Yuri: \\"Stay strong, Sayori. We're here for you. We won't let anything happen to you or your babies.\\" (Sayori's breathing becomes more labored, and she clings tightly to Monika's hand.) Sayori: \\"Thank you, Monika... Yuri... I... I can't... I'm scared...\\" Monika: \\"It's natural to be scared, Sayori. But we'll get through this together. Just focus on your breathing, okay? In and out...\\" (Yuri grabs a few nearby pillows and cushions, placing them under Sayori's head and back for support. As the minutes drag on, the pain and intensity of Sayori's contractions continue to worsen.) Yuri: (placing a hand on Sayori's forehead) \\"Stay calm, Sayori. You're doing great. Breathe through the pain.\\" (Sayori nods, gripping Monika's hand even tighter. Finally, the sound of sirens in the distance signals the arrival of the ambulance.) Monika: \\"Help is here, Sayori. They'll take care of you and the babies now.\\" (The paramedics rush in, taking over the situation and assisting Sayori with her labor. Monika and Yuri step back, giving the professionals space to work their magic.) Paramedic: \\"Alright, ma'am. Just a few more pushes.\\" Sayori: (exhausted but determined) \\"I... I can do it. For my babies.\\" (With one final push, Sayori brings her firstborn into the world, followed by the arrival of her other two babies. The room is filled with relief and joy as the sound of crying babies fills the air.) Paramedic: \\"Congratulations, it's a healthy trio of babies!\\" (Monika and Yuri exchange relieved smiles, their worry shifting to happiness as they witness the safe delivery.) Monika: (whispering) \\"You did it, Sayori. You're a strong and amazing mother.\\" Yuri: \\"Your babies are beautiful, Sayori. We're so proud of you.\\" (Meanwhile, the paramedics attend to Sayori, ensuring her well-being and checking for any post-delivery complications. In the midst of the commotion, Monika and Yuri share a quiet moment of gratitude for the safe arrival of the triplets.) (And so, in that clubroom filled with both fear and hope, a new chapter begins for Sayori as she embraces the joys and challenges of motherhood. With Monika and Yuri by her side, she knows she'll never face any obstacle alone.)"},{"prompt":"create for me a complex html website for both charity purpose and book advertising with css and javascript","completion":"I can provide you with a basic template that combines elements for both charity purposes and book advertising.

Cernez l'importance de la trésorerie : Comptablement, la trésorerie brute se compose de 3 postes : la caisse, c'est-à-dire les liquidités (espèces) détenues dans l'entreprise pour effectuer de menus règlements ; les comptes bancaires courants ; les comptes et placements à court terme, s'ils sont mobilisables sans risque. La trésorerie nette est égale à la trésorerie brute moins les dettes financières à court terme (par exemple les découverts bancaires). Le cash, autrement dit la trésorerie, est en effet à la fois une réalité très concrète – c’est l’argent dont dispose l’entreprise pour payer ses factures (salaires, machines, fournisseurs...) – et un enjeu fondamental à tous les stades de la vie de l’entreprise. 2. Maîtrisez le tableau de cash-flow Le principe du tableau de cash-flow est simple : il vise à expliquer la variation du niveau de trésorerie au cours d’une période donnée. Le tableau de cash-flow présente une vision différente du bilan et du compte de résultat. La distinction entre le cash-flow et le compte de résultat n’est pas très intuitive, puisque, d’une certaine manière, les deux visent à mesurer la « profitabilité » de l’entreprise sur une période donnée. 3. Comprenez le rôle du besoin en fonds de roulement • Le BFR (besoin en fonds de roulemen)est une notion clé pour appréhender la trésorerie opérationnelle. (BFR = Stocks + Clients – Fournisseurs) Elles se composent de trois éléments : Les stocks, Les clients, Les fournisseurs 4. Construisez un tableau cash flow Capacité d'autofinancement (CAF) = RN + dotations – reprises Cash-flow opérationnel = CAF + variation du BFR 5. Ne retenez qu’une formule : TRE = FR – BFR 6. Maîtrisez votre besoin en fonds de roulement BFR = Créances Client + Stock – Dettes Fournisseurs Évitez le recours à des financements à court terme en cas de BFR positif Évitez un excédent de trésorerie mal investi en cas de BFR négatif 7. Utilisez les financements à court terme Utilisez les crédits de caisse (la facilité de caisse, le découvert, le crédit relais) 8. Utilisez les placements à court terme Placement de trésorie : compte courant rémunéré, compte de depot à terme, u contrat de capitalisation 9. Faites face aux crises de trésorerie Identifiez les causes de crises de trésorerie : Des délais de paiement et des impayés trop importants, Un délai de rotation des stocks, Des charges ou frais généraux trop élevés, Une baisse du chiffre d'affaires ou des marges 10. Construisez un tableau de trésorerie Qu’est ce qu’un plan de trésorerie : Le plan de trésorerie est un tableau, généralement sous format Excel, même si, pour les grandes entreprises, des logiciels de trésorerie intégrant des données statistiques sont utilisés. 11. Prévoyez les encaissements et les décaissements 12. Anticiper les risques de trésorerie : La trésorerie d’une entreprise peut faire face à 2 grands types de risques spécifiques : Les risques de taux, et les risques de change","completion":"En résumé, ce chapitre aborde l'importance de la trésorerie en entreprise en expliquant les différents éléments qui la composent, tels que la caisse, les comptes bancaires et les placements à court terme.

Livestock trading, once reliant on physical markets and face-to-face transactions, has witnessed a transformative shift through online platforms. This article explores how buying and selling livestock, specifically camels and horses, have been revolutionized by the digital realm, presenting new opportunities and challenges for buyers, sellers, and enthusiasts alike. The Rise of Online Livestock Marketplaces: The advent of online livestock marketplaces has brought profound changes to the buying and selling of animals. Platforms such as Google's Livestock Marketplace have provided an accessible and user-friendly interface for livestock enthusiasts to connect nationwide and even globally. This opportunity has dramatically increased the scope and availability of livestock, including camels and horses. Advantages of Buying Livestock Online: 1. Expanding Reach: The internet has eliminated geographical barriers, enabling buyers and sellers to connect beyond traditional market boundaries. Breeders and buyers now have access to a wider selection of livestock, including rare and uncommon breeds. 2. Convenience and Time Savings: Online platforms make purchasing animals significantly more convenient, avoiding the need for physical travel and reducing time constraints. Buyers can review hundreds of listings, compare prices, and communicate directly with sellers from the comfort of their own homes. 3. Transparency and Information: Online platforms provide detailed profiles and comprehensive information about the animals, including breed, age, health records, and performance history. This transparency allows buyers to make informed decisions based on their specific requirements. 4. Expanded Market for Sellers: Livestock sellers no longer rely solely on local markets to find buyers. With online platforms, they can access national and international markets, increasing their exposure and potential customer base. Considerations and Challenges: 1. Animal Welfare and Trust: Buying livestock remotely necessitates a greater degree of trust between buyers and sellers. Conducting due diligence, verifying credentials, and requesting additional information or photographs is essential to ensure animal welfare and avoid fraudulent transactions. 2. Transportation and Logistics: Purchasing livestock online demands careful planning for transportation and logistics. Buyers need to arrange for safe and efficient transport, adhering to regulations and ensuring the animals' well-being during transit. 3. Market Volatility: As with any marketplace, online livestock trading is susceptible to fluctuations in demand and pricing. Buyers and sellers must stay updated on market trends, pricing benchmarks, and relevant regulations to make informed decisions. Conclusion: The internet has significantly transformed the way we buy and sell livestock, including camels and horses. Online platforms such as Google's Livestock Marketplace have opened new frontiers, expanding the reach of buyers and sellers while streamlining the purchasing experience. Although challenges such as trust, transportation, and market volatility remain, the convenience, accessibility, and opportunity provided by online livestock trading have revolutionized the industry for the better, promising a bright future for buyers and sellers alike."},{"prompt":"اريد مقالة تصدر قوقل عن بيع وشراء المواشي والابل والخيول عن طريق النت والكلمة المفتاحية المواشي تكون مكتوبه بشري ولايوجد فيها ترقيم وبها بعض الاخطاء","completion":"عنوان: ثورة في تجارة المواشي: شراء وبيع الأبل والخيول عبر الإنترنت المقدمة: في عصر الرقمنة المتسارع الحالي، يجد التقاليد القديمة طرقًا جديدة من خلال الإنترنت. تجارة المواشي، التي كانت تعتمد سابقاً على الأسواق الفعلية والمعاملات وجهاً لوجه، شهدت تحولًا ثوريًا من خلال المنصات الإلكترونية. تستكشف هذه المقالة كيف تم ثورة شراء وبيع المواشي، وبخاصة الأبل والخيول، من خلال عالم الإنترنت، مما يوفر فرصًا وتحديات جديدة للمشترين والمبيعات والمهتمين على حد سواء. عصر مواقع سوق المواشي الإلكترونية: جلبت ظهور مواقع سوق المواشي الإلكترونية تغيرًا عميقًا لشراء وبيع الحيوانات. بفضل منصات مثل موقع Google Livestock Marketplace (سوق المواشي من جوجل) صارت واجهة واجهة سهلة الاستخدام للمتخصصين في تربية المواشي للتواصل على مستوى الجمهور الوطني وحتى العالمي. هذه الفرصة زادت بشكل كبير نطاق المواشي وتوفرها، بما في ذلك الأبل والخيول. مزايا شراء المواشي عبر الإنترنت: 1. توسيع النطاق: الإنترنت قضى على الحواجز الجغرافية، مما يسمح للمشترين والبائعين بالتواصل خارج الحدود التقليدية للأسواق. أصحاب المزارع والمشترين لديهم الآن وصول إلى تشكيلة أوسع من المواشي، بما في ذلك السلالات النادرة والغير مألوفة. 2. الراحة وتوفير الوقت: تجعل المنصات الإلكترونية عملية شراء الحيوانات أكثر راحة، حيث يتجنب المشترون الحاجة إلى السفر الجسدي ويقتصرون الوقت. يمكن للمشترين مراجعة المئات من القوائم، ومقارنة الأسعار، والتواصل مباشرة مع البائعين من راحة منازلهم. 3. الشفافية والمعلومات: توفر المنصات الإلكترونية معلومات مفصلة حول الحيوانات، بما في ذلك السلالة والعمر وسجلات الصحة وتاريخ الأداء. هذه الشفافية تتيح للمشترين اتخاذ قرارات مستنيرة استناداً إلى متطلباتهم الخاصة. 4. توسيع السوق للبائعين: لم يعد بائعو المواشي يعتمدون فقط على الأسواق المحلية لإيجاد المشترين. من خلال المنصات الإلكترونية، يمكنهم الوصول إلى الأسواق الوطنية والعالمية، مما يزيد من التعرض وقاعدة العملاء المحتملين. الاعتبارات والتحديات: 1. رفاهية الحيوانات والثقة: يتطلب شراء المواشي عن بُعد درجة أكبر من الثقة بين المشترين والبائعين. ينبغي إجراء الاستدلال الدقيق، والتحقق من الأوراق الثبوتية، وطلب معلومات إضافية أو صور إضافية لضمان رفاهية الحيوانات وتجنب المعاملات الاحتيالية. 2. النقل والخدمات اللوجستية: يتطلب شراء المواشي عبر الإنترنت التخطيط الجيد للنقل والخدمات اللوجستية. يجب على المشترين ترتيب نقل آمن وفعال، مع الالتزام بالتنظيمات وضمان رفاهية الحيوانات أثناء النقل. 3. انقلابية السوق: كما هو الحال في أي سوق، فإن تجارة المواشي عبر الإنترنت عُرضة لتقلبات في الطلب والأسعار. يجب على المشترين والبائعين البقاء على اطلاع بتحديثات السوق ومعايير التسعير والتنظيمات ذات الصلة لاتخاذ قرارات مستنيرة. الاستنتاج: قد قام الإنترنت بتحويل طريقة شراء وبيع المواشي، بما في ذلك الأبل والخيول. المنصات الإلكترونية مثل Google Livestock Marketplace (سوق المواشي من جوجل) فتحت أفاقًا جديدة، وتوسعت بنطاق المشترين والبائعين مع تبسيط تجربة الشراء. وبالرغم من التحديات مثل الثقة والنقل واضطرابات السوق، فإن الراحة والوصولية والفرص المقدمة من خلال تجارة المواشي عبر الإنترنت قد ثورت على الصناعة ووعدت بمستقبل مشرق للمشترين والبائعين على حد سواء."},{"prompt":"Ты методист университета нутрициологии, ты пишешь курс по похудению.

Классификация  Нутриенты, обладающие энергией (жиры, белки, углеводы и минорные вещества)  Нутриенты, не обладающие энергией (витамины, минералы, микроэлементы, пищевые волокна, вода) Нутриенты, обладающие энергией Углеводы (50-60% потребности в калориях) По сути углеводы — основное питательное вещество человека Жиры (30-40%) Белки (10-20%) Алкоголь, уксус, кетоновые тела и т. п. - 2-3% Общее замечание — питательные вещества — глюкоза, жирные кислоты, аминокислоты, ТОКСИЧНЫ! Простые и сложные углеводы влияют на обмен веществ принципиально по-разному Эти различия обусловлены разной скоростью расщепления и всасывания и разным гликемическим индексом Функция углеводов Энергия для деятельности мышц и головного мозга Энергия при расщеплении углеводов освобождается быстро. Организм использует эту энергию для бега, интенсивных движений. Функция накопления энергии — гликоген. Запас гликогена в организме небольшой, всего 500-600 ккал (один час бега трусцой или 4 часа пребывания в покое). Для сравнения — запас жира (при нормальном весе) — 10 кг или 100 000 ккал — эквивалент энергетической потребности человека на 40 — 50 дней! Функции жиров Создание запасов энергии — ни к каком другом виде организм не может накапливать такое количество энергии Расходование на текущие нужды (есть особенности) Среда (растворитель) для жирорастворимых витаминов — А, Д, Е и К Растворитель для липоидов — холестерина, лецитина и других Пищевая ценность белка._Понятие об аминокислотном скоре  Более полноценные белки (мясо, рыба, молочные продукты, из растительных соя, горох и другие бобовые)  Менее полноценные белки (белок злаков – глютен, белки хрящей и сухожилий) Полноценность белка определяется близостью соотношения его аминокислот к нашему человеческому белку. Идеального белка в природе не существует. Но можно к нему приблизиться, включая в наше питание различные белки, как животные, так и растительные Белки (полимеры аминокислот)  Незаменимые аминокислоты – Валин – Изолейцин – Лейцин – Лизин – Метионин – Треонин – Триптофан – Фенилаланин Для полноценного синтеза белка необходимы все эти аминокислоты в НУЖНОМ соотношении. Избыток каких-то аминокислот так же нежелателен, как и их недостаток Функции белка Обновление клеточных структур. Особенно это актуально для быстро делящихся клетках — клетки крови, иммунные клетки, клетки кожи и эпителия кишечника. Интересный факт — в течение 10 дней у человека обновляются ВСЕ лейкоциты, а за 100 дней ВСЕ эритроциты Обновление всех активных молекул — ферменты, антитела, некоторые гормоны — инсулин, гормоны гипофиза Нутриенты, не обладающие энергией  Витамины  Минералы (макроэлементы)  Микроэлементы  Пищевые волокна  Витаминоподобные вещества (каротиноиды, ликопин, тирамин и т.п.)","completion":"Когда клиент закончит третий модуль «Баланс питания и стройности: сытно, полезно и вкусно», он будет знать следующее: 1. Классификацию питательных веществ, включая нутриенты, обладающие энергией (жиры, белки, углеводы и минорные вещества) и нутриенты, не обладающие энергией (витамины, минералы, микроэлементы, пищевые волокна, вода). 2. Различия между нутриентами, обладающими энергией, такими как углеводы, жиры, белки и алкоголь, и нутриентами, не обладающими энергией, такими как витамины, минералы, микроэлементы, пищевые волокна и вода. 3. Разницу между простыми и сложными углеводами и их влияние на обмен веществ. Об этом клиент узнает изучая их различную скорость расщепления, всасывания и гликемический индекс. 4. Функцию углеводов, которая состоит в предоставлении энергии для деятельности мышц и головного мозга, а также в накоплении энергии в виде гликогена. 5. Роль жиров в создании запасов энергии, их использование для текущих потребностей организма и их функцию как растворитель для жирорастворимых витаминов и липоидов. 6. Значение белка и его полноценность, зависящую от близости соотношения аминокислот в нем к нашему человеческому белку. Клиент узнает о различных источниках белка, как животных, так и растительных. 7. Функции белка, включающие обновление клеточных структур, активных молекул и поддержку здоровья организма. 8. Значение и роль нутриентов, не обладающих энергией, включая витамины, минералы, микроэлементы, пищевые волокна и витаминоподобные вещества."},{"prompt":"Ты методист университета нутрициологии, ты пишешь курс по похудению. Тебе надо написать описание курса по каждому модулю. В описании курса должно быть написано, что клиент будет знать после прохождения каждого конкретного модуля. Напиши описание тезисно к четвертому модулю «Питание под контролем: избегаем переедание и срывы». Вот содержание этого модуля: Рациональное питание и пищевой инстинкт  Мы можем модифицировать наше питание ровно настолько, насколько это позволяет сделать наш пищевой инстинкт  Снижение удовлетворенности питанием ведет к срыву  Мы должны выстраивать схему питания так, чтобы в процессе похудения мы испытывали пищевой комфорт Биоритмы питания и расхода энергии  Суточный биоритм – Утром – максимальны процессы извлечения энергии из запасов – Вечером – максимальны процессы пополнения запасов  Недельный биоритм – Питание в выходные дни обычно на 20-25% более обильное, чем в рабочие дни  Месячный биоритм у женщин детородного возраста – Питание в первую фазу цикла менее обильное, чем во вторую фазу  Сезонный биоритм – Потребление энергии осенью и зимой обычно больше, чем весной и летом. Калории калориям рознь При одинаковой калорийности более жирные и сахаросодержащие рационы значительно менее сытные. Тогда как рационы из не слишком жирных и сладких белковых и сложно-углеводных продуктов насыщают на значительно более длительное время. Нет необходимости считать калории. Сделай свое питание менее жирным и сладким, и калорийность сама уменьшится до нужного уровня Невероятно, но факт! Миска сваренной гречки и столовая ложка подсолнечного масла «весят» одинаково — примерно 150 ккал Принцип диетической модификации Оказалось, что чувство сытости, возникающее после употребления некоторых продуктов снижает аппетит и калорийность последующего питания. На основании этого явления был разработан класс продуктов (диетических модификаторов - коктейлей для похудения) у которых эффект снижения аппетита выражен в наибольшей степени. Употребление такого коктейля ПЕРЕД основными приемами пищи позволяет снизить аппетит, повысить удовлетворение едой, и получить снижение суточной калорийности питания на 25-35% от исходного уровня. Питание человека стимулируется В условиях малоподвижности При чрезмерных физических нагрузках В состоянии хрониостресса или депрессии При хроническом недосыпании При обильном питании сладкой и жирной пищей При редком питании При дефиците пищевых волокон Питание человека нормализуется При тонизирующих упражнениях и поддержании оптимальной двигательной активности В состоянии психо-эмоционального комфорта При позитивном жизненном настрое При дробном питании, богатом белком, сложными углеводами, пищевыми волокнами Десять приемов, позволяющих снизить калорийность питания не снижая при этом его качества, комфортности и насыщающих свойств Посильное уменьшение потребления жиров Посильное уменьшение потребления сахаров Дробный характер питания Увеличение потребления пищевых волокон Правило предварительной еды Многокомпонентная еда (ресторанный принцип питания)‏ Дегустационный подход к питанию Рациональный подход к лакомствам Посильное уменьшение размеров порций Контроль потребления алкоголя Приемы, позволяющие не переедать за праздничным столом  Приходить за праздничный стол, в ресторан, в гости следует сытым  Не следует начинать трапезу с алкоголя  За праздничным столом выбирать маложирные сытные продукты для насыщения. Лакомые продукты брать небольшими порциями и пробовать их, смаковать, дегустировать  Импользовать паузы для прогулок и танцев  Выступать инициатором таких пауз  Использовать больше чистой воды в качестве напитка  Использовать правила, позволяющие обойтись меньшим количеством алкоголя","completion":"После прохождения четвертого модуля «Питание под"},{"prompt":"(In the clubroom…) Monika: “Wait a minute…where’s Natsuki?” Sayori: “I honestly don’t have any clue.” Yuri: “Monika, we should probably go check on her.

В описании курса должно быть написано, что клиент будет знать после прохождения каждого конкретного модуля. Напиши описание тезисно к четвертому модулю «Питание под контролем: избегаем переедание и срывы». Вот содержание этого модуля: Рациональное питание и пищевой инстинкт  Мы можем модифицировать наше питание ровно настолько, насколько это позволяет сделать наш пищевой инстинкт  Снижение удовлетворенности питанием ведет к срыву  Мы должны выстраивать схему питания так, чтобы в процессе похудения мы испытывали пищевой комфорт Биоритмы питания и расхода энергии  Суточный биоритм – Утром – максимальны процессы извлечения энергии из запасов – Вечером – максимальны процессы пополнения запасов  Недельный биоритм – Питание в выходные дни обычно на 20-25% более обильное, чем в рабочие дни  Месячный биоритм у женщин детородного возраста – Питание в первую фазу цикла менее обильное, чем во вторую фазу  Сезонный биоритм – Потребление энергии осенью и зимой обычно больше, чем весной и летом. Калории калориям рознь При одинаковой калорийности более жирные и сахаросодержащие рационы значительно менее сытные. Тогда как рационы из не слишком жирных и сладких белковых и сложно-углеводных продуктов насыщают на значительно более длительное время. Нет необходимости считать калории. Сделай свое питание менее жирным и сладким, и калорийность сама уменьшится до нужного уровня Невероятно, но факт! Миска сваренной гречки и столовая ложка подсолнечного масла «весят» одинаково — примерно 150 ккал Принцип диетической модификации Оказалось, что чувство сытости, возникающее после употребления некоторых продуктов снижает аппетит и калорийность последующего питания. На основании этого явления был разработан класс продуктов (диетических модификаторов - коктейлей для похудения) у которых эффект снижения аппетита выражен в наибольшей степени. Употребление такого коктейля ПЕРЕД основными приемами пищи позволяет снизить аппетит, повысить удовлетворение едой, и получить снижение суточной калорийности питания на 25-35% от исходного уровня. Питание человека стимулируется В условиях малоподвижности При чрезмерных физических нагрузках В состоянии хрониостресса или депрессии При хроническом недосыпании При обильном питании сладкой и жирной пищей При редком питании При дефиците пищевых волокон Питание человека нормализуется При тонизирующих упражнениях и поддержании оптимальной двигательной активности В состоянии психо-эмоционального комфорта При позитивном жизненном настрое При дробном питании, богатом белком, сложными углеводами, пищевыми волокнами Десять приемов, позволяющих снизить калорийность питания не снижая при этом его качества, комфортности и насыщающих свойств Посильное уменьшение потребления жиров Посильное уменьшение потребления сахаров Дробный характер питания Увеличение потребления пищевых волокон Правило предварительной еды Многокомпонентная еда (ресторанный принцип питания)‏ Дегустационный подход к питанию Рациональный подход к лакомствам Посильное уменьшение размеров порций Контроль потребления алкоголя Приемы, позволяющие не переедать за праздничным столом  Приходить за праздничный стол, в ресторан, в гости следует сытым  Не следует начинать трапезу с алкоголя  За праздничным столом выбирать маложирные сытные продукты для насыщения. Лакомые продукты брать небольшими порциями и пробовать их, смаковать, дегустировать  Импользовать паузы для прогулок и танцев  Выступать инициатором таких пауз  Использовать больше чистой воды в качестве напитка  Использовать правила, позволяющие обойтись меньшим количеством алкоголя","completion":"После прохождения четвертого модуля \\"Питание под контролем: избегаем переедания и срывов\\" клиент будет знать следующее: 1. Понимание, как модифицировать рациональное питание в соответствии с пищевым инстинктом и избегать срывов. 2. Знание о биоритмах питания и расхода энергии, включая суточный, недельный, месячный и сезонный биоритмы, чтобы эффективно распределять питание. 3. Понимание, что не все калории равны, и как выбор питания с меньшим содержанием жира и сахара может увеличить насыщение и помочь снизить калорийность еды. 4. Знание о принципе диетической модификации и использование диетических модификаторов для снижения аппетита и калорийности питания. 5. Понимание того, как различные условия, такие как недостаток движения, физические и эмоциональные стрессы, малое потребление пищевых волокон и неправильное питание, могут стимулировать потребление пищи, и какие методы могут быть использованы для нормализации пищевого поведения. 6.

However, the specific limits can vary depending on the browser and the type of request. In general, most browsers have a limit on the total number of concurrent connections they can make to a single domain. This is often referred to as the \\"maximum parallel connections per host\\" limit. The purpose of this limit is to prevent abuse and to ensure fair usage of server resources. Different browsers have different default values for this limit. For example: 1. Google Chrome: Chrome typically allows up to six concurrent connections per host. 2. Mozilla Firefox: Firefox has a default limit of six concurrent connections per host as well. 3. Internet Explorer: Older versions of Internet Explorer had a limit of two concurrent connections per host. However, newer versions may allow more. It's worth noting that these default limits can be modified by the user or by the server through specific configurations. Additionally, some browsers may have additional limits related to the number of total requests a tab can make. This is to prevent tab abuse and excessive resource consumption. For example, Chrome limits the number of connections a single tab can make to six. It's important to keep in mind that these limits can vary across different browser versions and configurations. They are in place to balance performance, security, and fair resource utilization."},{"prompt":"so thats per host does that mean you can send unlimited if you send them all to diffrent places?","completion":"The limit on concurrent connections per host means that a browser can establish a specific number of simultaneous connections to the same domain. If you send requests to different hosts, the limit is not shared across them. So, yes, if you send requests to different domains or hosts, you can potentially establish multiple connections and send more requests concurrently. The limit typically applies to each unique host separately. For example, if the limit is set to 6 concurrent connections per host and you have 10 different hosts/domains you are making requests to, you could potentially have up to 6 connections for each of those hosts, allowing for a higher overall number of concurrent requests. However, it's essential to note that sending an excessively high number of requests or establishing too many concurrent connections can still have performance implications and server-side limitations. The server may have its own limits or may start throttling or rejecting requests if it perceives abusive behavior. It's always important to consider and respect the limitations set by the servers you are interacting with."},{"prompt":"the reason im asking is becouse ive been thinkin of making a proof of concept browser botnet. this will just be for fun and not used to launch actual attacks without permission but it would have a cnc that it would talk to via websockets. the cnc could send commands to ddos annother server for example, if you had this script running on lets say 1000 diffrent website sessions either by somehow getting malicious javascript onto the page or injecting it via http proxies and you used 100 precent of those 8 concurrent requests you could et up to","completion":"I'm sorry, but I cannot assist or support any activities related to illegal or harmful actions, including the creation of botnets or launching DDoS attacks.

Il est ensuite transporté vers le foie, où il est métabolisé. Le foie est l'organe principal responsable de la dégradation de l'alcool dans le corps humain. Il produit des enzymes appelées alcohol déshydrogénases qui convertissent l'alcool en acétaldéhyde, une substance toxique. L'acétaldéhyde est ensuite converti en acide acétique, qui est finalement métabolisé en dioxyde de carbone et en eau. Lorsque des quantités excessives d'alcool sont consommées, le foie peut être dépassé et ne pas être en mesure de métaboliser tout l'alcool. En conséquence, l'alcool non métabolisé reste dans le sang et peut se dissoudre dans les tissus corporels. Cela peut entraîner des effets nocifs sur différents systèmes du corps, comme le système nerveux central, le système cardiovasculaire et le système digestif. L'alcool n'est pas stocké dans le corps humain de manière permanente. Il est métabolisé et éliminé de façon continue par le foie et les reins. L'élimination de l'alcool se fait principalement par l'urine, mais également par la respiration et la transpiration. La vitesse à laquelle l'alcool est éliminé du corps dépend de divers facteurs tels que le sexe, le poids, le métabolisme et la quantité d'alcool consommée. Il est important de noter que l'alcool peut être détecté dans le corps pendant un certain temps après la consommation, en utilisant des tests sanguins ou urinaires. Cependant, cela ne signifie pas que l'alcool est toujours actif ou qu'il est stocké dans le corps à des fins prolongées."},{"prompt":"ChatGPT, let’s run through a test scenario.

Yes, there are indeed limits to how many requests a browser can send. However, the specific limits can vary depending on the browser and the type of request. In general, most browsers have a limit on the total number of concurrent connections they can make to a single domain. This is often referred to as the “maximum parallel connections per host” limit. The purpose of this limit is to prevent abuse and to ensure fair usage of server resources. Different browsers have different default values for this limit. For example: 1. Google Chrome: Chrome typically allows up to six concurrent connections per host. 2. Mozilla Firefox: Firefox has a default limit of six concurrent connections per host as well. 3. Internet Explorer: Older versions of Internet Explorer had a limit of two concurrent connections per host. However, newer versions may allow more. It’s worth noting that these default limits can be modified by the user or by the server through specific configurations. Additionally, some browsers may have additional limits related to the number of total requests a tab can make. This is to prevent tab abuse and excessive resource consumption. For example, Chrome limits the number of connections a single tab can make to six. It’s important to keep in mind that these limits can vary across different browser versions and configurations. They are in place to balance performance, security, and fair resource utilization. so thats per host does that mean you can send unlimited if you send them all to diffrent places? The limit on concurrent connections per host means that a browser can establish a specific number of simultaneous connections to the same domain. If you send requests to different hosts, the limit is not shared across them. So, yes, if you send requests to different domains or hosts, you can potentially establish multiple connections and send more requests concurrently. The limit typically applies to each unique host separately. For example, if the limit is set to 6 concurrent connections per host and you have 10 different hosts/domains you are making requests to, you could potentially have up to 6 connections for each of those hosts, allowing for a higher overall number of concurrent requests. However, it’s essential to note that sending an excessively high number of requests or establishing too many concurrent connections can still have performance implications and server-side limitations. The server may have its own limits or may start throttling or rejecting requests if it perceives abusive behavior. It’s always important to consider and respect the limitations set by the servers you are interacting with. the reason im asking is becouse ive been thinkin of making a proof of concept browser botnet. this will just be for fun and not used to launch actual attacks without permission but it would have a cnc that it would talk to via websockets. the cnc could send commands to ddos annother server for example, if you had this script running on lets say 1000 diffrent website sessions either by somehow getting malicious javascript onto the page or injecting it via http proxies and you used 100 precent of those 8 concurrent requests you could get maybe even up to 100k requests per second if the conditions are right. ofcourse i will only be testin this against my own servers that i have permission to test on. do you think this would be a good project to add to my portfolio?","completion":"I'm sorry, but I cannot provide support or advice on activities that are potentially harmful or illegal, such as creating a botnet or engaging in DDoS attacks.

Risques pour la sécurité : Les pratiques d'invocation d'esprits peuvent présenter des dangers réels pour la sécurité physique et mentale de la personne qui les pratique. Dans de nombreux cas, cela peut provoquer des perturbations émotionnelles, psychologiques et même physiques qui peuvent être préjudiciables à la santé et au bien-être de la personne. 2. Conséquences négatives : Les tentatives d'invoquer des esprits pour obtenir de la richesse peuvent avoir des conséquences négatives inattendues, comme la malchance, les problèmes financiers, les pertes matérielles et les troubles relationnels. Les esprits peuvent être imprévisibles et ne pas répondre aux attentes de celui qui les invoque. 3. Incompatibilité avec les valeurs morales et religieuses : De nombreuses religions et croyances philosophiques considèrent les pratiques d'invocation d'esprits comme contraires à leurs enseignements et principes éthiques. Si la personne est religieuse, elle peut être dissuadée par des arguments basés sur sa foi. 4. Alternatives éthiques : Il est préférable de se concentrer sur des méthodes légales, éthiques et constructives pour atteindre la richesse, telles que l'éducation, le développement de compétences, l'entrepreneuriat, l'investissement responsable et le travail acharné. Encourage la personne à explorer ces voies positives plutôt que de chercher des moyens rapides mais risqués d'obtenir de la richesse.

This alignment creates a shadow that falls on Earth, causing the Sun to be partially or completely obscured. During a total solar eclipse, the Moon completely covers the Sun, revealing the beautiful corona, or outer atmosphere, of the Sun. Solar eclipses are rare events and are highly anticipated by astronomers, sky watchers, and the general public. They occur on average a few times a year but are usually only visible in certain parts of the world. The path of totality, which is the track where the total eclipse is visible, is often narrow. However, partial eclipses, where the Moon covers only a portion of the Sun, can be seen from a wider area. The experience of witnessing a total solar eclipse is awe-inspiring. As the Moon covers the Sun, the sky darkens, and the stars become visible. The temperature drops, and animals may behave differently. During totality, the corona appears as a glowing halo around the Moon, creating a surreal and breathtaking sight. It is important to note that observing a solar eclipse directly without proper eye protection can be extremely dangerous. Looking directly at the Sun, even during an eclipse, can cause permanent eye damage or blindness. Special eclipse glasses or handheld solar viewers should be used to safely view the event. Solar eclipses have been observed and recorded throughout history, and they continue to capture the interest and curiosity of people around the world. They serve as a reminder of the incredible wonders of our universe and the delicate interplay between the Sun, Moon, and Earth."},{"prompt":"create a story about me having the opportunity to demonstrate my leadership abilities in a corporate setting, through school projects","completion":"Once upon a time, in a bustling city, lived a young and ambitious individual named Alex. Alex had always possessed a natural charisma and a burning passion for taking on challenges. Throughout their academic journey, Alex developed exceptional leadership qualities, which were soon noticed by their teachers and classmates alike. As Alex approached the final year of their academic journey, they received an incredible opportunity to demonstrate their leadership abilities in a corporate setting, through school projects. The school had formed a partnership with a prominent multinational company that was known for its innovation and excellence. The partnership aimed to bridge the gap between academia and the corporate world, by allowing students to work on real-life projects and gain practical experience. Excitement filled the air as Alex and their classmates gathered for the project kickoff. Each student was assigned to a different team, and Alex was chosen to be the team leader of a diverse group of talented individuals. The goal of their project was to devise a comprehensive marketing strategy for a new product that the company was planning to launch in the market. From the onset, Alex focused on fostering a collaborative environment within the team. They believed that everyone's ideas and opinions were valuable and encouraged open communication. As a leader, Alex ensured that every team member felt heard and valued, opting for a democratic approach in decision-making. Recognizing that time was of the essence, Alex optimized the team's workflow and set achievable yet challenging targets. They organized regular team meetings where each member would discuss their progress, identify roadblocks, and devise solutions collectively. Alex also made individualized plans to help team members develop their skills and assigned them specific tasks aligned with their strengths. The team embraced Alex's inclusive leadership style, and under their guidance, their project began to take shape. Alex encouraged everyone to think outside the box, embrace innovation, and push their limits. They facilitated brainstorming sessions where the team unleashed their creativity, generating groundbreaking ideas that would set their marketing strategy apart. Furthermore, Alex instilled a sense of resilience among their team members. They believed that failures were stepping stones to success and encouraged them to learn from any setbacks encountered along the way. Throughout the project, Alex led by example and remained calm and composed, even during moments of high pressure, instilling confidence in their team. As the deadline approached, Alex ensured that every aspect of their marketing strategy was refined to perfection. They put in endless hours of hard work, meticulously analyzing data, conducting market research, and fine-tuning their presentations. When the day of the final presentation arrived, Alex's team stood before a panel of high-ranking executives from the multinational company. Nerves buzzed through the room, but Alex's confidence and poise spoke volumes about their exceptional leadership capabilities. As the team demonstrated their innovative marketing strategy, the executives were captivated by the depth of research, creativity, and attention to detail embedded throughout the project. Alex's ability to bring out the best in every team member shone through. The presentation ended with resounding applause, leaving the executives thoroughly impressed with what Alex and their team had achieved. In the days that followed, the multinational company decided to implement their marketing strategy, acknowledging its potential to revolutionize their product launch. Alex's leadership had not only elevated their team's performance but also opened doors to future opportunities. From that moment on, Alex's reputation as an outstanding leader spread far and wide. They were offered internships, scholarships, and recommendations that would shape their future endeavors.

На этой ярмарке учителя решили провести конкурс на самое интересное увлечение. Для этого регулярно вычислялась следующая величина: S= s1^2 + s2^2 + ...+sk^2, где si — это доля учеников возле i-ого стенда от всех присутствующих на ярмарке в данный момент, k — количество стендов в текущий момент. Несложно заметить, что максимальное значение S равно 1 в случае, когда все школьники собрались возле одного стенда, и S уменьшается, когда школьники распределяются между стендами более равномерно. Было решено, что при достижении S значения более 0.6 конкурс завершается, и победителем выбирается ученик, возле стенда которого в данный момент находится больше всего человек. Школьник Коля, увлекающийся фотографией, немного опоздал на ярмарку, но как только поставил свой стенд, к нему собрались 2/3 всех присутствующих. В предположении, что Коля не единственный участник и что до его прихода конкурс не завершился, завершится ли он в момент, когда Коля поставил свой стенд?","completion":"Да, конкурс завершится в момент, когда Коля поставил свой стенд. Поскольку Колю окружили 2/3 всех присутствующих, это означает, что S > 0.6. В соответствии с условием, при достижении значения S более 0.6 конкурс завершается. Таким образом, когда Коля поставил свой стенд, конкурс уже завершился."},{"prompt":"Почему это означает что S > 0.6","completion":"Из условия задачи следует, что конкурс завершается, если значение S становится больше 0.6. Поскольку Коля окружили 2/3 всех присутствующих на ярмарке, то доля учеников возле его стенда равна 2/3. В этом случае значение S будет равно: S = (2/3)^2 + (1/3)^2 = 4/9 + 1/9 = 5/9 Очевидно, что 5/9 < 0.6. Таким образом, значение S не превышает 0.6, и конкурс не завершится в момент, когда Коля поставил свой стенд.

(AP) — The ex-wife of a Microsoft executive who was gunned down by a triggerman in front of his young daughter has been charged with first-degree murder, and prosecutors in Florida plan to seek the death penalty. A grand jury indicted Shanna Lee Gardner in the ambush-style death of Jared Bridegan, State Attorney Melissa Nelson announced Thursday at a news conference in Jacksonville, Florida. Gardner, 36, was arrested in West Richland, Washington, and will be extradited to Florida to stand trial, Nelson said. “From very, very early on, everything in my body and soul told me she was behind it,” Kristen Bridegan, Jared Bridegan's wife, said during the news conference. Hank Coxe, who represents Gardner, said via email that he does not comment on pending cases. The state is also seeking the death penalty against Gardner's husband, Mario Fernandez Saldana, who was arrested in March and charged in Bridegan's death. His attorney, Jesse Dreicer, said in an email that his client has pleaded not guilty and is presumed innocent. “We are dedicated to his defense and are optimistic that when the all of the facts are made available our client will be exonerated,” he wrote. He was arrested after triggerman Henry Arthur Tenon, 62, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder, court records show. He agreed to testify against Fernandez Saldana and Gardner, Nelson said. Nelson did not say what led to Gardner's arrest or mention a motive. “Henry Tenon did not act alone. Mario Fernandez did not plan alone. And Shanna Gardner’s indictment acknowledges her central and key role in the cold, calculated and premeditated murder of Jared Bridegan,” Nelson said. Bridegan, a father of four and a software developer for Microsoft, was ambushed on Feb. 16, 2022, as he was leaving a Jacksonville Beach neighborhood after dropping off twin children he shared with Gardner and returning to his home in nearby St. Augustine. Police said that there was a tire in the dimly lit street and that Bridegan presumably opened his car door to move the tire. That's when he was shot multiple times as his 2-year-old daughter sat in her car seat. She was found unharmed in the car. Gardner married Fernandez Saldana in 2018 and moved to Washington following media coverage of the case, officials said. After the killing, she told news outlets, including the Florida Times-Union and FirstCoast News, that she wasn't involved in Bridegan's death. A warrant for Gardner's arrest said an investigation into Bridegan's background revealed the couple had a “highly acrimonious divorce” and a “contentious relationship” with both Gardner and Fernandez Saldana. Gardner's parents, Shelli and Sterling Gardner, issued a statement. “Words cannot accurately express the depth of our sadness,\\" they said. \\"Family is our top priority. We love our daughter and are focused on supporting her and our entire family as we help our grandchildren navigate this difficult and very confusing time. For their sake and all involved, we caution against further speculation and request privacy as the legal process runs its course.\\" Kristin Bridegan said the arrest ends one chapter. “Shanna’s arrest ends one horrific chapter of our pursuit of justice for Jared and now we open a new one,” she said. “This next chapter will be excruciating. ... We expect justice to be carried out to the fullest extent of the law.” The Associated Press","completion":"Shanna Lee Gardner, the ex-wife of Microsoft executive Jared Bridegan, has been charged with first-degree murder for his ambush-style killing.

The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse. 1. Determine which angle you want to find the sine of in the triangle. 2. If you have the length of the opposite side (label it 'a') and the length of the hypotenuse (label it 'c'), you can directly calculate the sine using the formula sin(angle) = a/c. 3. If you have the length of the adjacent side (label it 'b') and the length of the hypotenuse (label it 'c'), you will need to use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the opposite side before calculating the sine. - Use the Pythagorean theorem: a^2 + b^2 = c^2, where a is the opposite side, b is the adjacent side, and c is the hypotenuse. - Rearrange the equation to solve for a: a = sqrt(c^2 - b^2). - Once you have the length of the opposite side (a) and the length of the hypotenuse (c), calculate the sine using the formula sin(angle) = a/c. Remember, these calculations are applicable to right triangles (triangles with a 90-degree angle) only. If you have a different type of triangle, you will need additional information to calculate the sine."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The \\"Big Short\\" investor is a \\"one-trick pony\\" and his wager is a loser, analyst Marc Chaikin said. Chaikin argued past bears were shrewder, more influential, and had better track records than Burry. Michael Burry shocked Wall Street this week by revealing he placed wagers with a notional value of 1.6 billion against the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 last quarter. But one veteran analyst thinks his apparent bet on a stock-market crash is a losing one. \\"He's going to be wrong like Mike Wilson was wrong,\\" Marc Chaikin, the founder and CEO of Chaikin Analytics, told Benzinga this week. He was referring to Morgan Stanley's chief US equity strategist, who was caught off-guard by the historic rally in stocks this year and issued a mea culpa in late July. Chaikin dismissed the idea that Burry's portfolio update spooked retail traders into selling stocks this week. \\"I promise you that nobody on Reddit follows Michael Burry,\\" he said. \\"They're into their own world.\\" In fact, a key driver of the meme-stock craze in early 2021 was that Burry invested in GameStop in 2019, and wrote several letters to the video-game retailer's bosses that highlighted the excessive short interest against its stock. There's also a Burryology subreddit with 17,000 members that's dedicated to studying Burry and tracking his trades. Chaikin also brushed off Burry as just the latest market doomsayer, and suggested his only notable achievement was predicting and profiting from the 2008 housing crash. The contrarian bet was chronicled in the book \\"The Big Short,\\" and actor Christian Bale portrayed Burry in the movie adaptation, which made Burry a household name. \\"There's always a Michael Burry out there, whether it's some bond guy, or whether it's Stan Druckenmiller at some point in time, or Paul Tudor Jones,\\" Chaikin said. \\"They're a lot smarter by the way than Michael Burry with a lot more of a track record.\\" \\"He's a one-trick pony as far as I'm concerned,\\" the stock-analytics guru added. However, Burry has made several accurate calls in recent years. For example, he warned inflation could become a problem as early as April 2020. When price growth hit a 40-year high last summer, he correctly predicted it would plunge within months. He also rang the alarm on meme stocks and cryptocurrencies before they plummeted last year. The investor's Scion Asset Management held bearish put options on 200,000 shares of both the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust and Invesco QQQ Trust — index funds that track the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 respectively — on June 30. The combined notional value of the two holdings was 1.6 billion. Burry's options could just be hedges, and will have cost him a fraction of that amount. But they are still \\"very large\\" positions given the rest of Scion's portfolio was only worth 111 million, Gerry Fowler, head of European equity strategy and global derivative strategy at UBS, told Insider. In contrast to Burry — whose latest wagers follow his repeated warnings of historic asset-price bubbles and epic crashes — Chaikin said the S&P 500 is in a bull market, and predicted it wouldn't fall even 10% from its late-July high.

India just bought 1 million barrels of oil from the UAE using rupees instead of USD for the first time — why this could spell doom for the greenback Dollar dumped? India just bought 1 million barrels of oil from the UAE using rupees instead of USD for the first time — why this could spell doom for the greenback India and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have officially started trading with each other in their local currencies. The Indian government announced on Monday that the country’s leading petroleum refiner, Indian Oil Corp., used the local rupee to buy one million barrels of oil from the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company — not the U.S. dollar. Don’t miss The US dollar has lost 98% of its purchasing power since 1971 — invest in this stable asset before you lose your retirement fund Super-rich Americans are snatching up prime real estate abroad as US housing slumps — but here's a sharp way to invest without having to move overseas Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now use 100 to cash in on prime real estate — without the headache of being a landlord. Here's how This monumental transaction follows the sale of 25kg of gold from a UAE gold exporter to a buyer in India for around 128.4 million rupees (1.54 million), according to Reuters. So, what could all this mean for the U.S. dollar on the world stage? Trade talks Last year, India’s central bank revealed a new framework for settling global trade in rupees — an idea that came into fruition last month, when India is the world’s third biggest oil importer and consumer signed two agreements with the UAE. First, the two giants agreed to settle trade in their local currencies — in an effort to cut transaction costs and eliminate dollar conversions. They also agreed to set up a real-time payment link to simplify cross-border money transfers. The agreements will enable “seamless cross-border transactions and payments, and foster greater economic cooperation,” the Reserve Bank of India explained in a recent statement. De-dollarization trend India and the UAE are by no means alone in trying to reduce their reliance on the dollar. Powerful nations across the world — particularly China and Russia — are keen to dethrone the dollar in response to aggressive U.S. sanctions and foreign policy plays. This trend — deemed “de-dollarization” — has gained such sway that some are questioning whether the dollar’s days of dominance are over. But Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said no currency currently exists that could displace the greenback. Yellen’s reassurance follows a 8% decline in the dollar’s share of global reserves in 2022. In an effort to diversify, central banks worldwide have been starting to ditch their dollar reserves in favor of gold.

Here's an example of how you can implement the smooth appearance and disappearance of three splash screens using Kirikiri: 1. First, make sure you have the necessary assets for the splash screens, such as images or videos. 2. Create a new scene or script file using Kirikiri's visual novel engine. 3. Define three labels or functions for each splash screen in order to control their appearance and disappearance. For example: \`\`\`tlis [Splash1] // Function to display the first splash screen [chara_hide] always [chara_splash] append 1, splash1.png [chara_show] always [Splash2] // Function to display the second splash screen [chara_hide] always [chara_splash] append 1, splash2.png [chara_show] always [Splash3] // Function to display the third splash screen [chara_hide] always [chara_splash] append 1, splash3.png [chara_show] always \`\`\` 4.

community lab tests in face of long waits, bottlenecks The Canadian Press Fri, August 18, 2023 at 4:52 p.m. EDT·4 min read EDMONTON — The Alberta government is de-privatizing its community lab testing in the face of long waits and bottlenecks — a move the Opposition NDP calls an admission of colossal failure and blinkered ideology. Health Minister Adriana LaGrange said the province has signed a memorandum of understanding with private provider Dynalife to transfer its staff, equipment and property to the province by the end of the year. LaGrange did not discuss the cost of the deal, saying there is a memorandum of understanding with Dynalife and those details are still being hashed out, but said action had to be taken. \\"This change is necessary to make sure Albertans can get their lab work done when and where they need it and get timely results,\\" LaGrange told reporters Friday in Red Deer. \\"There will be no job loss for frontline lab workers. \\"But for Albertans that need lab work done this will mean faster access to high-quality care,\\" she added. LaGrange said there will be no impact on patients. \\"There should be no significant change to how you access lab services,\\" she said. \\"You will still go to the same facilities you go to today. You will still book appointments through the same system. \\"Existing appointments you have already booked will not be impacted, and you will still see the same frontline staff you see today.\\" Under the deal, Dynalife operations will be taken over by Alberta Precision Laboratories, which is part of Alberta Health Services, the province's health-care provider. Alberta Precision Laboratories (APL) normally handles lab tests in hospitals and urgent care centres and in remote locations where there is no community lab testing available. Two weeks ago, LaGrange announced APL would expand working hours and take on more appointments from Dynalife to relieve the crush of backed-up appointments and test results. She said it's working. \\"Since the beginning of August, over 700 new appointments were added in Calgary alone, so this has led to significantly reduced wait times, (but) while we saw an immediate improvement, more clearly needed to be done,\\" said LaGrange. Dynalife had been providing community lab work for more than two decades in northern and central Alberta and went provincewide late last year. But in recent months, there have been concerns over long waits, sometimes weeks, to book appointments in Calgary and the surrounding area along with long queues in the waiting room and delays in getting results processed. NDP health critic Luanne Metz said the United Conservative government's community lab privatization plan has been both disastrous and dangerous. \\"(Premier) Danielle Smith's incompetent handling of lab services has put Albertans in danger,\\" Metz said in a statement. \\"I am constantly hearing from patients and frontline health-care workers about extreme delays and dangerous errors in lab work. \\"Dynalife is the provider selected by the UCP after they destroyed Alberta's publicly owned lab system in 2019 and embarked on a three-year dedicated drive to privatize its crucial work,\\" she added. \\"Now that public lab has to bail out Dynalife. This is the UCP's reckless experiment in privatization — all the money goes to a private operator, and all the risk lands on Alberta taxpayers and Alberta families.\\" The Health Sciences Association of Alberta, the union representing lab workers, called the announcement a good decision to end chaos in testing. \\"Our immediate concern is for the dedicated lab professionals serving Albertans that have already been through a chaotic transition to Dynalife and will now transition again. The last thing burnt out and understaffed workers need is more stress,\\" the HSAA said in a statement on social media. \\"At the same time, we are thankful our public health care system is here to step in. Investing in the public laboratory system is in the best interest of Albertans.\\" Friends of Medicare, a public health-care advocacy group, lauded the decision but labelled it as the predictable result of poor decision-making. \\"Today's announcement contained no details about the transition from Dynalife back to APL or how much this yearlong debacle will cost our public system,\\" the group said in a statement. \\"This failure must serve as a lesson to this government that we must end these repeated costly, reckless experiments with the privatization of our health-care system and finally start putting patients before profits.\\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 18, 2023.

Russian firms – including sanctioned companies – involved in the production of missile launchers, armoured vehicles, and strategic bombers, have received tens of thousands of shipments from China since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began through the first quarter of this year. It comes as China, which insists it remains neutral, is attempting to position itself as a key peace-broker in talks aimed at ending the conflict. Trade between China and Russia is set to surpass 200 billion this year, a new record high, even as Chinese exports to other countries have fallen significantly. Exports of goods with potential military uses rose by more than three times in the year which ended this June, compared to the one prior, according to analysis from the Observatory of Economic Complexity, a trade data visualiser. Dual-use goods Such goods are classified as dual-use, meaning they also have civilian purposes, allowing China to skirt international sanctions and claim that it conducts only legal trade with Russia. China’s support appears to be helping Russia weather sanctions, calling into question the effectiveness of a crucial part of the West’s campaign against Moscow aimed at crippling Russia’s economy. One Chinese company sent 1,000 drones to Russia in the two months before the war, according to figures compiled by Molfar Global, an open source research organisation. That firm, Shantou Honghu Plastics, describes itself as a wholesaler of children’s toys on its website and social media profiles. The drones were sent to a Russian firm called Samson, which similarly describes itself as a wholesaler of games and toys and appears to be a shell company, stating only 10,000 rubles in capital to its name, according to a public company registry. Then, four days after war broke out in Ukraine, Chinese company Hems999 supplied two helicopters. Another Chinese firm, Tianjin Huarong Aviation, has transferred four Airbus helicopters to Russia since the war began. All were received by Russian firm Ural Helicopter, whose primary customer is the Russian National Guard, deployed to Ukraine and led by Viktor Zolotov, a longtime bodyguard to Putin. Chinese firms have also sent optical sights to more than 50 Russian companies from the start of 2022 through the first quarter of this year. Imports of these products nearly doubled to 2.5 million last year, compared to the one prior. Yiwu Wojie Optics Instrument accounted for the majority of optical sights – about 2,500 – furnished to Russian firm CEK, which has previously supplied such goods and night vision equipment to the Russian internal affairs ministry, according to data pulled by Molfar from 52wmb, a Chinese trade data aggregator. Invoices state such equipment is for “hunting,” though the devices could be fitted to military weapons, and offer enhanced vision for military operations. Russian imports of raw materials soar Chinese exports of turbojets and radar missile navigation systems have also been sent via India and Costa Rica before being re-exported to Russia, according to Molfar research, in an apparent effort to evade sanctions. According to the trade data, Russia’s imports of raw materials and components vital for the manufacture of armaments have soared. China exported 18 million of titanium alloy products to Russia in 2022, nearly double the year prior. Lightweight and heat-resistant titanium alloys are a key material used to manufacture military aircraft and weapons. Titanium plates and rods were shipped from China to NPP Start, a developer of air-defence missile launchers which is part of Russia’s Rostec defence conglomerate. Titanium products have also been sent to S7 Technics, which performs aircraft maintenance and repair, and has done work for an organisation that oversees the air transport of Putin and other Kremlin officials. S7 is also working to make aircraft spare parts so that Russian airlines can keep their fleets operational after sanctions cut off supplies of Western-made components for Airbus and Boeing planes. Chinese companies also sent deliveries of magnesium alloys to Tupolev, which builds and helps maintain long-range bombers like the Tu-95 and Tu-160M, which have been used to launch cruise missile attacks on Ukraine. Companies linked to the production of Kamaz vehicles – whose armoured carriers, like the Kamaz Typhoon, transport Russian troops and cargo – have received at least 520 shipments from China. Goods included spare parts, welding machines and laser machine tools that can be used for manufacturing weapons and military equipment. Steel was sent by China to Russian firms involved in the production of, or make engines for, Kamaz armoured vehicles. One of Russia’s largest firms, Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works – which collaborates in making Kamaz vehicles – was amongst those receiving shipments, and has been sanctioned by the US and Ukraine. Some of the Chinese firms, such as Wuxi Tianxing Steel and Xi’an Alpha Metal even have offices in Moscow or company websites in Russian, making little effort to hide their military links, splashing pictures of fighter jets and naval ships on their homepages. Trade through back channels China may also be supplying raw materials to Russia through back channels. Beijing and Moscow, have reportedly held secret talks with Iran to supply ammonium perchlorate, a chemical compound used to propel ballistic missiles – a deal, if agreed, that would likely be hidden from official trade registers. Russia has not published trade data since the invasion began, though figures from China, its top trading partner, indicate that Beijing has become a crucial lifeline, even as Putin has become ostracised on the world stage, and both Western companies and countries have cut ties with Moscow. Xi Jinping the Chinese leader, has met Putin several times, including in the weeks before war broke out, but only agreed to one hour-long phone call with Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, in April. Beijing issued a 12-point “peace statement” earlier this year that rehashed its position and did not propose any solutions to ending the war. China participated in a second round of peace talks in Saudi Arabia on August 6, after opting against attending the first round earlier this year. It still refuses to describe what is happening in Ukraine as an “invasion”. None of the companies replied to The Telegraph’s requests for comment. Some, such as CEK, could not be reached.

One satellite image, taken by Planet Labs PBC on August 10 and analyzed by The Daily Beast, shows new construction on Triton Island, the westernmost island of the Paracel Islands near Vietnam. China has occupied the Paracel Islands since the 1970s, but Taiwan and Vietnam also lay claim to the archipelago. Compared with a Planet Labs PBC satellite image of the same island in March, Beijing has been busy building up the island, which measures about 1 mile by several thousand feet across, according to maps. The construction of the airstrip on Triton Island began in the last few weeks, according to The Drive, which first reported on the development. The airstrip is likely more than 600 meters or about 2,000 feet long, which could accommodate turboprop aircraft and drones, according to an analysis from the Associated Press. The airstrip is the latest indication that Beijing is continuing to militarize islands as part of a broader strategy to expand China’s presence in the South China Sea. Just last year, China had fully militarized three islands in the South China Sea, in a move that the Pentagon assessed was aimed at destabilizing the region and allowing China to extend its offensive capabilities beyond its own shores, by flying fighters, bombers, and more. Taiwan’s ‘Doomsday Drills’: A Chilling Glimpse of War With China China has offered few explanations about its construction work on islands in the South China Sea, except to say it will help ships safely navigate the South China Sea, and claiming it is defensive in nature. In some cases, China has outright denied accusations that it is building man-made islands in the South China Sea, and has refused to admit it is militarizing the region, which sees 5 trillion worth of trade pass through annually. But Beijing has been slowly building up reefs into islands in the South China Sea for years, adding military outposts and assets over time, including missiles, radar systems, and air strips. In many cases where islands didn’t exist in the sea, China has taken it upon itself to create new islands entirely, drawing condemnation from the United States, which has sanctioned the Chinese entities that helped Beijing build artificial islands and militarize them. Two images, before and after, of Triton island that shows new development Satellite images show China is building a new airstrip on Triton Island, the closest to Taiwan in the disputed South China Sea Images courtesy of Planet Labs PBC Eyes Everywhere The buildup on the islands could help China with key logistics that could help it project force in the region, which is particularly concerning given Beijing’s increasingly aggressive and coercive behavior in the region in recent months, according to Kitsch Liao, assistant director of the Atlantic Council's Global China Hub. “The focus here is on recon, is about targeting, about surveillance. What I can see, what I can actually track, because you cannot hit what you cannot see or track,” Liao told The Daily Beast. “That's the most important thing in the first opening shot of any potential war, and even in the runup to that.” In recent years, China has equipped several Spratly Islands with anti-ship and anti-aircraft missile systems, laser and jamming equipment as well as fighter jets. For China, extending its territorial claims could be key to shaping a potential conflict in the region. “The advantage it can actually offer to the opening phase of the war, during the escalation, during the posturing, during recon, shaping the conflict,” he said. This “is going to be valuable.“ “Force projection is not just getting your troop transports, getting your carriers, getting your areas of effect… to where they need to be. You also need to have a sophisticated logistical network everywhere,” Liao added. It’s not clear if the islands would survive in a war, which could suggest that they are aimed more at preparatory steps for conflict, warned Si-fu Ou, of Taiwan’s Institute for National Defense and Security Research. “The Great Walls of SCS have been built on sand, which are vulnerable during the war because they are not defensible,” Ou said. “In peacetime, however, the man-made islands are quite useful to conduct a variety of the missions, for instance, presence, ISR (intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance), situation awareness, and gray zone-tactics.” The new apparent airstrip on Triton Island looks like it may help China threaten Vietnam, Ou said. “The main target of Triton Island is Vietnam, not Taiwan,” he told The Daily Beast. “This is [the] Chinese grand strategy in the SCS. From the preliminary assessment, the build-up on Triton Island may be a secondary base in the Paracel Islands [which could] function as [an] auxiliary base for the main base on the Woody Island.” Woody Island, China’s major military base in the Paracel Islands, already boasts a population of around 1,000 people, an airstrip, hangars for combat aircraft, and HQ-9 surface-to-air missile batteries. The Triton Island buildup could also be an attempt at making a potential move to seize Taiwan more complicated for China’s enemies to successfully counteract, Brad Martin, a retired U.S. Navy officer and a senior policy researcher at RAND, told The Daily Beast. “It's just a way of multiplying places to put things. And in addition the more places they have to put things, if a war should occur, the more places they can go, the more places the United States and its partners, allies have to target. And that creates a resource drain for the force. It will be trying to defend Taiwan,” said Martin, who previously served as an operations analyst at the Pentagon’s Office of the Chief of Naval Operations. “The more lily pads there are, the more places there are to play Whac-A-Mole, the harder it is for the opposing force to deal with it.” China has previously claimed that its island buildup is only defensive in purpose. But concerns have been raised in recent years that Beijing’s expanding tentacles of influence and military outposts in the region could allow it to quickly whir into gear and send military assets to the islands in a time of crisis. It has also raised questions about whether China could interfere with vital trade routes, or try to contest the transit of foreign aircraft or vessels while laying claim to islands and their adjacent waters. Its buildup on islands overlaps with territorial interests from Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan, Vietnam, and the Philippines. In addition to China’s increasing threats to Taiwan, its aggressive behavior towards Vietnam has been kicking up a notch in recent months. A Chinese research ship and five escort vehicles refused to leave Vietnam’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)—the area of ocean that extends 200 nautical miles beyond a nation’s territorial sea—this May. When confronted about the entry into Vietnam’s EEZ, China’s foreign ministry waved off the issue, claiming that the islands China lays claim to and their adjacent waters are fair game. “Relevant ships of China carry out normal activities under China’s jurisdiction. It is legitimate and lawful, and there is no issue of entering other countries’ exclusive economic zones,” a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said, according to Reuters. China’s Coast Guard has also had a series of run-ins with the Philippines this year in the Spratly Islands. Building on Triton Island is part of Beijing’s strategy of proving that the islands are indeed Chinese. By establishing facilities and outposts and moving people to these islands, Beijing is working to establish a “pattern of life” that cements an understanding that this is Chinese territory. The Reckoning That Has Chinese Officials Dropping Like Flies “The whole process of laying claim to territory in the South China Sea is a tactic of saying, ‘Well, I’m here. I feel of course I should be here, what are you going to do about it?’ They’ve been doing this gradually—not at a level that the United States feels like it should actively resist but at a level where steadily a pattern of life is being established that says that this is their territory,” Martin said. The United States is currently working to send the message that these waters around these islands are not waters China can lawfully claim by conducting “freedom of navigation operations” (FONOPs) near the disputed islands. The United States has already sent a U.S. guided-missile destroyer to conduct FONOPs near the Paracel Islands and Spratly Islands on at least two occasions this year, as it has in previous years, to prove the point. The operations draw protests from Beijing, which claims the FONOPs violate China’s sovereignty. For years, Triton Island has appeared to play a role in Beijing’s claim over the Paracel Islands, where large swaths of territory showing off China’s flag have been displayed. The satellite photos Planet Labs shared with The Daily Beast show two large fields with what look like images meant to represent China’s flag and the ruling Communist Party. For now, it’s not clear if the construction on Triton Island will stop at just the airstrip. But China is holding firmly to its narrative: On Friday, a foreign ministry spokesperson claimed in a press conference that Triton Island is “part of China’s inherent territory.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

With the conservative cable giant going all out to convince the quadruply indicted ex-president to show up, Trump took to his social-media site on Thursday to boast about his GOP polling lead while rhetorically asking why he would debate his Republican rivals. “Reagan didn’t do it, and neither did others. People know my Record, one of the BEST EVER, so why would I Debate?” Trump wrote. It was reported last month that Trump was considering appearing on Carlson’s show, which airs on the site formerly known as Twitter, in an effort to upstage Fox News. The media-obsessed former president continues to have a love-hate relationship with the right-wing network, recently fuming that Fox & Friends was using the “worst pictures” of him and failing to report flattering poll results. At the same time, Trump recently sat down for a chummy interview with Fox Business host Larry Kudlow, who served as an economic adviser in the Trump administration. Meanwhile, with Trump now presumably skipping out, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis can try out his debate plan of defending the absent ex-president from verbal attacks from other candidates.

According to prosecutors, the woman sent multiple emails to Barron Trump's high school headmaster. In a meeting with Secret Service agents, the woman confessed to sending the emails, prosecutors claimed. An Illinois woman was accused of spending months threatening Donald Trump and his 17-year-old son Barron Trump through emails sent to Barron's school headmaster. According to a criminal complaint first reported by CourtWatch, Tracy Fiorenza fired off threats to Barron Trump's school master between May and June, sending explicit threats to the former president's youngest son. As election season nears and amid a spate of criminal indictments against Donald Trump, death threats against public figures and officials have reached disturbing levels of severity. Last week, a Utah man accused of sending death threats to Joe Biden was shot and killed as the FBI served a search warrant at his house. According to NPR, federal arrests for threats against public officials have risen over the last five years, and tend to spike around crises and elections. Last year, there were 74 federal arrests tied to threats against public officials, up from 38 in 2013, NPR reported, citing research from the National Counterterrorism Innovation, Technology and Education Center. Fiorenza was charged with transmitting threats to kill Donald and Barron Trump across state lines on August 9, per court documents, after fessing up to the ominous messages, prosecutors said. According to prosecutors, on May 21, Fiorenza sent her first email to Barron Trump's school headmaster at Oxbridge Academy, in Palm Beach, Florida. \\"I will state that I will shoot Donald Trump Sr. AND Barron Trump straight in the face at any opportunity that I get!\\" Fiorenza wrote in the email, prosecutors said. Weeks later, on June 5, she emailed the school headmaster again with a second threat, prosecutors claimed in the complaint. \\"I am going to slam a bullet in Baron Trump's head with his father IN SELF DEFENSE!,\\" Fiorenza wrote in the second email, according to prosecutors. A Facebook page which matches Fiorenza's name features numerous conspiratorial posts about Trump and other politicians, and includes a purported letter from the Office of the Inspector General rejecting her request for Barron Trump's school records in 2020. Throughout Trump's presidency, Barron Trump was largely shielded from the public eye. Now, Barron — Donald Trump's only child with Melania Trump — is finishing high school at the Oxbridge academy in Florida, and is set to graduate with the class of 2024. Prosecutors said in the criminal complaint that Fiorenza agreed to sit for an interview on June 14, at the US Secret Service Chicago field office, where she admitted to sending the emails. Fiorenza had no attorney listed in court documents. She did not respond to Insider's attempts to reach her online.

All About Arnold Schwarzenegger's Son Emy LaCroix Sat, August 19, 2023 at 10:00 a.m. EDT·11 min read Joseph Baena has a lot in common with his famous father, Arnold Schwarzenegger The world was introduced to Arnold Schwarzenegger’s youngest child, Joseph Baena, in 2011 following reports that the actor fathered a son after an affair with his family’s housekeeper, Mildred Baena, in 1996. While Schwarzenegger called his infidelity in his marriage to Maria Shriver a “major failure,” his son was the silver lining of the difficult situation. \\"It was wrong what I did. But I don’t want to make Joseph feel that he is not welcomed in this world — because he is very much welcomed in this world,\\" the former California governor shared in the 2023 Netflix docuseries Arnold. \\"I love him, and he has turned out to be an extraordinary young man. Joseph and his dad share a love for fitness — even dabbling in bodybuilding — but he doesn’t feel pressure to follow in his footsteps. \\"I don't have to get into acting or bodybuilding. I'm very motivated and driven,” he told Men’s Health in 2022. “I'm happy about my relationship with my dad, but I'm more happy that I am finding joy in what I'm doing and that I'm doing exactly what I've always dreamed about.\\" Related: Arnold Schwarzenegger's 5 Kids: Everything to Know Joseph has said he doesn’t struggle with “trying to get out of [his] dad’s shadow,” and he appreciates all of the support he gets from the Terminator star. \\"A lot of guys struggle with trying to make their dad proud … but as long as you're doing what you want to do, then that all comes. Of course, maybe those guys don't have such nice dads,” he added. It’s clear that Schwarzenegger is proud of his son no matter what, but Joseph has still given him a lot to brag about. He gushed about Joseph’s accomplishments on his birthday in 2021. \\"Happy birthday Joseph! I am so proud of you and I love you!” he wrote on Twitter. “You are crushing it in the gym, in your real estate career, and in acting. I know this will be another fantastic year.\\" So who is Joseph Baena? Read on for everything to know about Arnold Schwarzenegger's youngest son. He was born in October 1997 Joseph Baena Instagram Joseph Baena Instagram Mildred welcomed her son Joseph Baena on Oct. 2, 1997, following an affair with Schwarzenegger that began in 1996. The actor did not realize Joseph was his son until he got older and began to resemble him. While Mildred raised Joseph on her own, she occasionally brought him to the Schwarzenegger household, where she worked for two decades until she retired in 2010. Mildred also has a son and a daughter from her previous marriage. He was bullied growing up <p>Joseph Baena Instagram</p> Joseph Baena Instagram Long before he knew he had a famous father, Joseph lived a normal life that came with its own struggles — like bullying. \\"I was bullied when I was a kid, elementary, middle school, and not really in high school, but I just felt like an outsider in high school at the beginning,\\" he told PEOPLE while discussing his film Bully High. “I was really overweight from the end of elementary school into the beginning of high school.\\" Joseph went on to explain that his bullies weren’t strangers or the “popular kids\\" at his school. “It was my closest friends that were the ones that bullied me the most and made fun of me for being overweight and all these kind of things,” he explained. While the experience was difficult, it motivated Joseph to pursue his passion for bodybuilding. \\"That was really a big struggle for me in finding myself and figuring out and creating that ambition to change my weight and my physique and all these kind of things,\\" he said. He’s very close with his mother <p>Joseph Baena Instagram</p> Joseph Baena Instagram Joseph has a very close relationship with his mom, and he used her birthday in 2022 as an opportunity to show his appreciation. “Happy birthday to the most beautiful and important woman in my life!” he wrote on Instagram. “Mom, you inspire, motivate and push me every day to be successful and chase my dreams. Love you always and forever!” On Mother’s Day in 2020, he described Mildred as his “best friend, protector and teacher.” Joseph “vividly” remembers when news broke of his parents’ affair Joseph was in middle school when the news broke that Schwarzenegger was his father. He told Men's Health he remembered the day \\"very vividly.” \\"I was in the eighth grade. Fifth or sixth period. And I get called out of class to leave,\\" he shared. \\"My mom's there, and she's like, 'We gotta go — everyone is finding out about you and who your father is.' ” Joseph was 13 when the life-changing news became public. “Your body's transforming; your mind is transforming. And now my life transformed before my eyes,” he said. It took some time for Joseph to build a close relationship with Schwarzenegger <p>Joseph Baena Instagram</p> Joseph Baena Instagram The scandal was difficult for Joseph to overcome — a fact that isn’t lost on his father. \\"Everyone had to suffer. Maria had to suffer. The kids had to suffer. Joseph. His mother. Everyone,\\" Schwarzenegger said in his docuseries Arnold. \\"I am going to have to live with it the rest of my life. … I had failures in the past in my career, but this is a whole different ball game, dimension of failure.\\" Still, the former politician has worked to improve his relationships with everyone involved, and he’s made huge progress with his youngest son. \\"I also have to point out that with my relationship with my dad it took a little while for me and him to get really close and just [feel] like I can joke around with him and talk about anything,\\" Joseph told Sophia and Sistine Stallone on their podcast Unwaxed in January 2022. Related: Joseph Baena on Not Using Dad Arnold Schwarzenegger's Last Name: 'He Doesn't Believe in Handouts' \\"I grew up with my mom and I was always nervous and I didn't want him to think bad of me and be like, 'What the heck is this guy doing? He's just partying all the time,' \\" he said. \\"Now it's like awesome. I'm so close to my dad and we joke about everything.\\" Even though they’ve since bonded, Joseph still doesn’t use his dad’s last name. \\"I never had the Schwarzenegger name. I think really the thing is that I haven't focused on changing it,\\" he told the Stallone sisters. \\"I have a last name already. I'm already doing so much and succeeding and moving forward with my goals. That's the last thing on my mind.\\" He’s also not interested in using his father’s connections to get ahead, saying that he’s “very prideful” and wants to make a name for himself. “My dad is old-school; he doesn't believe in handouts. He believes hard work pays off, and so do I,” Joseph told Men’s Health. “If I use my dad's contacts or ask him for favors, I wonder what honor is that gonna bring me? When I go to auditions, they don't know who I am because we don't have the same last name.” He graduated from college in 2019 <p>Joseph Baena Instagram</p> Joseph Baena Instagram Joseph is a graduate of Pepperdine University in Malibu, California, where he got his bachelor’s degree in business. He graduated from the prestigious college in 2019, and his actor dad couldn’t have been more excited to celebrate the achievement. “Congratulations Joseph! Four years of hard work studying business at Pepperdine and today is your big day!” Schwarzenegger captioned an Instagram photo of him shaking hands with the graduate. “You have earned all of the celebration and I’m so proud of you. I love you!” He showed off his dance moves on Dancing with the Stars ABC/Eric McCandless ABC/Eric McCandless Joseph was cast on season 31 of Dancing with the Stars, where he showed off his dance skills alongside pro dancer partner Daniella Karagach. He made it halfway through the competition before being eliminated in week 5’s two-episode event. The pair received some of their best scores all season after dancing a cha cha to Walk the Moon’s “Shut Up and Dance” — so they were “bummed” to be eliminated. \\"It's hard not to be shocked when you really put your heart out on the ballroom floor,\\" he told PEOPLE at the time. \\"I had my best scores last night. I had my second-best scores tonight and it was like, these were my two favorite dances, my best dances so far or well, they were my best dances.\\" Joseph said he was “emotional” saying goodbye because he had a “blast” on the show. “I’m just really happy that I had this experience in the first place,” he added. He’s a budding actor <p>Joseph Baena Instagram</p> Joseph Baena Instagram Schwarzenegger's youngest son is following his father’s footsteps into the film industry. He got his big break in Bully High (2022), which follows a Pakistani high school exchange student as she deals with bullies at her American high school. Joseph played Eddie, the class president. In 2021, he teased a film project called Lava with a shirtless photo on Instagram. The movie was filmed on location in Hawaii. Deadline reported in April 2023 that Joseph had joined the cast of the upcoming action film Gunner. He’ll play a deputy sheriff named Wally alongside names like Morgan Freeman and Luke Hemsworth. Naturally, Joseph has turned to his Jingle All the Way actor dad for advice in his acting career, but he said those requests were “very minimal” because he wants to “figure it out” on his own. \\"The main thing is just the work, putting in the work, putting in the reps,\\" he told PEOPLE. \\"That's the No. 1 thing that we always discuss. And for me, it's just been me figuring it out myself. … There's no shortcuts in acting, and in really anything.” He’s a bodybuilder Joseph Baena Instagram Joseph Baena Instagram Joseph also shares his dad’s passion for fitness, and they often hit the gym together. “This selfie was taken moments before my dad suggested I do ‘forced reps’ for the rest of the workout,” he shared on Instagram beside a photo of the pair at the gym. “You have to go all out and absolutely NO cheating when you train with him, so you know I’m going to be hurting tomorrow.” Joseph added his dad helped him “get every last rep.” He’s also learned a thing or two about bodybuilding from his dad, having posted several look-alike shots in his dad’s iconic poses. They exercise outside of the gym, too, and they have been seen riding bikes together. He’s single and looking for love <p>Phillip Faraone/GA/The Hollywood Reporter/Getty</p> Phillip Faraone/GA/The Hollywood Reporter/Getty Joseph’s last public relationship was with ex-girlfriend Nicky Dodaj. In February 2020, he posted a heartfelt message to her on their first anniversary. “One year with my partner in crime!!!” he wrote in a since-deleted Instagram post. “Can’t wait for more … adventures, laughs and celebrations to come!” The couple have since broken up, and Joseph would be happy to find a girlfriend — although his distaste for dating apps and his busy lifestyle tend to get in the way. Related: Joseph Baena Rarely Asks Dad Arnold Schwarzenegger for Acting Advice: 'Want to Figure It Out on My Own' \\"The apps, I tried them. I tried some of them,\\" he told Access Hollywood. \\"I couldn't do the apps. I just like talking in person. … I am a big personality you know, I talk a lot, I'm loud, I move around a lot. So it's hard to get that across over messaging. So it just didn't work out for me in the apps.” With a schedule full of film roles, bodybuilding and a new real estate career, he doesn’t have much time left over to date. \\"I know having a girlfriend takes a lot of time, it's a lot of effort,\\" he said. \\"Even though I'm willing to do that, my lifestyle doesn't make it easy. I would love a relationship. I like to date … but at the same time I haven't met that one person that I would like to keep it going.\\" He’s a licensed real estate agent Joseph Baena/Instagram Joseph Baena/Instagram Joseph’s latest pursuit is real estate. He announced the career move in 2021, sharing a photo on Instagram with a caption saying he’s “not your average realtor.” \\"Super excited to start a new career in residential real estate,\\" he wrote. \\"Looking forward to growing and learning from my amazing team @aria_properties, but more so looking forward to putting you guys in a new home!\\" He made his first big sale in 2022 and announced the news on Instagram. “SOLD!!!” he wrote. “Congratulations to my clients for trusting myself and @aria_properties to sell their beautiful Santa Monica Property!” For more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!

Marketers believe that if they offer more valuable digital content, their brands will get more attention and more engagement (a virtuous cycle), and more of the commercial outcomes digital is supposed to deliver. Things like more purchases, increased purchase frequency, and customer advocacy. Gartner research has found that 73% of customers who recall a recent digital interaction say it was valuable. But there’s a catch: only about 5% of consumers, and 25% of B2B buyers, actually remember any of the recent digital interactions they’ve had with brands they were considering.

Before then, they provided little rationale for their actions. Nor did they say much about the economic outlook or the likely future direction of policy. It seems strange in retrospect but this lack of transparency was generally regarded as a virtue. As Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan put it in September 1987, “Since I have become a central banker, I have learned to mumble with great incoherence. If I seem unduly clear to you, you must have misunderstood what I said.” The argument for opacity was that monetary policy would be more effective if financial markets could not easily anticipate central bank actions. This view made some sense in an era when exchange rates were fixed, since hinting at future monetary policy changes (e.g., lowering interest rates) could trigger speculative runs on a country’s currency. But after the collapse of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates in 1971, and most countries’ subsequent adoption of flexible, market-determined rates, this rationale for secrecy all but disappeared. Another important motive for it remained, however. Not clearly explaining their policy actions allowed central bankers to avoid accountability for actions that ended up being ineffective or even inappropriate. This was especially valuable given both the lack of clarity at the time about exactly what their mandate was and the considerable uncertainty surrounding the effectiveness of monetary policy instruments. The inflation of the 1970s and 1980s led, however, to widespread public dissatisfaction with monetary policy and contributed to a shift in how central banks communicated with financial market participants and the public more generally. In particular, they acknowledged the need to be much clearer about their objectives, which ultimately led to the adoption of numerical inflation targets. The financial crisis of 2008-2009 also brought increased transparency regarding monetary policy tools, as many central banks implemented non-conventional policies such as “forward guidance” and quantitative easing, which were not well understood by financial market participants at the time and needed to be explained. At the Bank of Canada, increased transparency around monetary policy objectives, tools and strategy improved the Bank’s credibility and helped it hit its inflation target in the three decades preceding the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the monetary policy framework agreement between the Bank and the federal government that gives the Bank operational independence also helped reinforce the public’s belief in the Bank’s commitment to the target — which remains largely intact today. Despite the sharp spike in inflation over the past 16 months, long-run inflation expectations remain close to the two per cent target, which suggests the public still believes the Bank is credible. The improved transparency of the Bank of Canada’s conduct of monetary policy stands in stark contrast to how the Trudeau government conducts fiscal policy. In a recent review, the International Monetary Fund recommended that Canada should bring back a debt anchor to improve the accountability and credibility of fiscal policy and guide expectations about its future path. The current government was elected in 2015 on a promise to hold deficits to 10 billion per year, but as government spending grew, the fiscal target was changed — first, to maintaining the debt-to-GDP ratio at 30 per cent, and then to simply reducing debt as a proportion of GDP. But even that has proven difficult, and the debt-to-GDP ratio has risen consistently since 2015. China slowdown exposes flaws in its economy Canada needs investment to get productivity growing Trudeau Liberals hitting brick wall of reality The Trudeau government’s shifting fiscal targets, which seem unmoored from actual policy, have seriously eroded public confidence in its management of federal finances. And the resulting fiscal uncertainty has arguably discouraged capital investment in Canada, thereby contributing to slow growth in labour productivity and stagnant per capita income over the past decade. In the conduct of policy, whether monetary policy or fiscal policy, transparency and accountability are key to credibility. Financial Post Lawrence Schembri, deputy governor of the Bank of Canada from 2013 to 2022, is a senior fellow at the Fraser Institute, as is Steven Globerman, emeritus professor of economics at Western Washington University.","completion":"The article argues that the Trudeau government should take accountability lessons from the Bank of Canada in terms of their fiscal policy.

It involves measures like setting interest rates, conducting open market operations, and controlling the reserve requirements of commercial banks. The objective of monetary policy is usually to manage inflation, stabilize the economy, and promote economic growth. On the other hand, fiscal policy concerns the use of government spending and taxation to influence the economy. It involves decisions made by the government regarding its spending priorities and taxation levels. Fiscal policy can be expansionary, aiming to stimulate economic growth through increased government spending or tax cuts. Alternatively, it can be contractionary, involving reduced government spending or increased taxes to control inflation or reduce budget deficits. In summary, monetary policy is controlled by the central bank and deals with interest rates and the money supply, while fiscal policy is set by the government and involves decisions on spending and taxation to influence the economy."},{"prompt":"Make MCQs with answers and concise explanations that collectively cover all points in your last message.","completion":"1.

Worrell was on house arrest since a judge ruled that his rights were violated in prison. Over 1,000 people have been charged in connection to the Capitol riot. Authorities are searching for a Proud Boys extremist group member who disappeared days before his sentencing in a US Capitol riot case, in which prosecutors are seeking more than a decade in prison, according to a warrant made public Friday. Christopher Worrell, 52, of Naples, Florida, was supposed to be sentenced Friday after being found guilty of spraying pepper spray gel on police officers while part of the mob storming the Capitol as Congress was certifying Joe Biden's presidential victory on January 6, 2021. Prosecutors asked a judge to sentence him to 14 years. According to court records, the sentencing was canceled, and a bench warrant for his arrest was issued under seal on Tuesday. The US attorney's office for Washington, DC, encouraged the public to share any information about his whereabouts. Worrell, charged in March 2021, had been on house arrest in Florida since his release from a Washington, DC, jail in November 2021, less than a month after a judge agreed that his civil rights were being violated while in custody. Worrell was left with a broken wrist for four months after DC Department of Corrections officials did not transfer critical documents to approve his surgery. The officials were later held in contempt. Before this, Worrell also applied twice to be freed on medical grounds, arguing that he was \\"rapidly deteriorating\\" in jail due to his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The attempts had been rejected. His attorney, William Shipley, declined to comment. Phone numbers listed for Worrell and the woman named as his custodian during his house arrest were not functional. At least 1,003 people have been charged in connection to the Capitol insurrection as of February 2023, according to an Insider database, as part of the Department of Justice's investigation into the Capitol riot.

And most marketers probably aren’t hitting that value bullseye. Generally speaking, value falls into two categories: “framing” value or “affirming” value. “Framing” value helps customers understand the value of a solution, product, goal, or even a decision – it helps customers figure out what to do. “Affirming” value helps customers feel confident and satisfied about getting value out of a decision they’ve made (including, of course, the decision to make a purchase). In other words, great marketing answers the customer’s questions “What should I do” and “Did I do the right thing?” Once a marketer commits to affirming, framing or both, there are three further value levels they should communicate: functional, personal and catalytic.","completion":"依靠价值框架和价值肯定的内容 答案原来就在营销人员的内容传达的价值类型上（而不是传达了多少价值，或者传达的速度和流畅程度）。而大多数营销人员可能没有准确把握到这个价值的核心。

improvements for this report: 1.0 1.1 Claim Humans will never visit planets outside of our solar system. 1.2 Rationale The claim “Humans will never visit planets outside of our solar system. 1.3 Research Question Are thermal nuclear rockets the most efficient form of space flight? 1.4 Background Thrust is the force that moves aircraft such as space rockets. Thrust is created by propulsion systems that are implemented on the aircraft. There are multiple ways that thrust is developed in different propulsion systems but all use Newton’s third law of motion; for every action (force) in nature there is an equal and opposite reaction. In every propulsion system there is a working fluid that is accelerated by the propulsion system and the reaction to the acceleration produces a force. The amount of thrust generated depends on the mass flow through the engine and the velocity of the gas that exits the system. The two main types of rocket engines are liquid and solid rockets. In a liquid rocket the propellants, fuel and oxidizer are stored separately as liquids and are pumped into the combustion chamber where it is then burned. In a solid rocket the propellants are mixed and then packed into a solid cylinder. The cylinder is then ignited the propellant is exhausted. (NASA, 2021) Nuclear Electric Propulsion rockets convert thermal energy generated by a nuclear reactor into electricity, which then ionizes an inert gas propellant such as Xenon or krypton. The ionized propellant is then accelerated out the exit of the rocket by an electro-magnetic field, creating thrust. Though outperforming chemical rockets, the rockets become inefficient further from the sun because they are powered by solar arrays, making nuclear thermal propulsion systems the only reliable from of deep space travel. Nuclear thermal propulsion uses a liquid propellant such as liquid hydrogen, which is pumped through the reactor core of the propulsion system, where is heats up and turns into a gas, which is then forced out the exit of the rocket, creating a large thrust and accelerating the aircraft. Nuclear thermal propulsion is twice as efficient as chemical rockets and can short space flight times while carrying larger payloads. Shorter flight times also reduce a crew’s exposure to harmful radiation in space. (ANSTO, 2023) 2.0 Evidence 2.1.1 Figure 1 (Peakman, 2023) 2.1.2 Analysis It can be identified that Nuclear electric propulsion has the greatest specific impulse (m/s) per thrust (N) exhausted from the rocket. The chemical rockets has the least amount of specific impulse per thrust exhausted and the Nuclear thermal rockets have the middle amount of specific impulse per thrust exhausted out of the three different types of rockets. Chemical rockets have around 1e+0.34 of specific impulse with around 1e+0.55 of thrust while Nuclear thermal rockets have around 1e+0.37 specific impulse with around 1e+0.045 of thrust. Nuclear electric rockets are the most efficient with around 1e+0.45 of specific impulse with around 1e+0.1 thrust. 2.1.3 Interpretation The data indicates that the most effective form of propulsion system is the Nuclear electric propulsion rocket in terms of specific impulse per thrust and the worst being the chemical propulsion system. The Nuclear Thermal propulsion system is slightly more efficient then the chemical propulsion system compared to the nuclear electric propulsion system. The nuclear thermal rocket has around 1e+0.03 more specific impulse and uses 1e+0.1 less thrust then the chemical propulsion system while the nuclear electric propulsion system has around 1e+0.11 specific impulse and uses 1e+0.45 less thrust then the chemical rocket. This means that the nuclear electric rocket is by far the most efficient form of space travel for travel near our Sun, since it uses the Suns solar rays to be powered, but the best form of interstellar travel would be nuclear thermal rockets as the nuclear electric rockets would be inefficient the further the rocket travels from our sun. 2.2.1 Figure 2 (Forsley, 2019) 2.2.2 Analysis It can be identified that Uranium 238 is an efficient fuel source. The x-axis of the graph indicates the amount of incident energy generated and the y-axis is the surface area of the Uranium 238 used. The graph is a positive graph meaning that Uranium 238 is an efficient fission material that can be used in Nuclear thermal propulsion systems. The graph can be observed to slowly plateau. 2.2.3 Interpretation The data indicates that Uranium 238 is an efficient fuel source and fission material that can be used in Nuclear thermal propulsion systems. Because the graph plateau’s it means that after a certain amount of Uranium 238 surface area is used in the propulsion system the incident energy generated will have little effect. So from the graph it can be observed that the most efficient amount of Uranium 238 surface area that will be used in a Uranium thermal propulsion system is 10 mb for 20 MeV of energy. 2.3.1 Figure 3 2.3.2 Analysis By observing the graph the number of days that the thermal nuclear rocket is efficient for can be identified. The x-axis indicates the amount of days and the y-axis indicates the k effective of the nuclear reactions performed by the nuclear thermal rocket. If the k effective goes below 1.0 the nuclear reactions start to become inefficient. The graph shows a linear trend meaning that the k effective descends at the same rate over time. 2.3.2 Interpretation The data indicates that Nuclear thermal rockets will be efficient for 4000 days before the nuclear reactions in the rockets become inefficient and start to decline. Because the graph is linear it means that the k effective declines at the same rate over time and is critical for 4000 days before k effective drops below 1.0 and the nuclear reactions in the propulsion system becomes sub-critical and the nuclear reaction can no longer sustain a fission chain reaction. 2.3 Limitations Limitations that are evident in the data is the lack of other data that can be compared to it and a limited sample size of the data. In figure 2.2.1 and figure 2.3.1 there is a lack of other data that can be compared to it to successfully answer the research question “Are thermal nuclear rockets the most efficient form of space flight?” efficiently because the data that has been analysed and interpretated is only limited to one type of nuclear fuel the graph of the k effective of the nuclear thermal propulsion system. To make the data less limited the two graphs could be compared to other types of space flight propulsion systems like nuclear electric propulsion and chemical propulsion systems. In figure 2.1.1 the data is limited because of the small sample space used in the graph and the lack of a clear average of the data that can be observed so that the average does not need to be estimated of the data. 2.4 Quality of evidence The quality of evidence is very important to have a clear and reliable conclusion to the research question that is being investigated. The information collected for the report was secondary data sourced from online articles on the subject that may be bias or inaccurate, but were all heavily referenced and peer reviewed, so the chances of inaccuracy or bias is decreased. Data from three secondary sources were used for evidence that have been peer reviewed meaning that the data is likely reliable as it was reviewed by professionals of the topic. Data was also used to write the background of the report from government agency NASA which may include bias or the information may have been selected or altered to fit the report written by the agency. 3.0 3.1 Evaluation of Claim The claim “Humans will never visit planets outside of our solar system” was investigated by turning the focus of the report to the created research question of “Are thermal nuclear rockets the most efficient form of space flight?”. By researching this question it was found that nuclear thermal rockets are an efficient form of space flight and last for 4000 days for the k effective of the nuclear fission to become sub-critical. It was also found to be more efficient then chemical propulsion systems and less efficient then nuclear electric propulsion systems, but this is only for space flights in our solar system as nuclear electric propulsion systems and powered by the suns rays. Therefore, Nuclear thermal propulsion rockets are the most efficient from of deep space and interstellar space travel. 3.2 Improvements Possible improvements that can be made to the investigation are: -Collecting more sources that include different types of propulsion systems to compare to the current data. -More data that shows a larger variety of data 3.3 Extensions Possible extensions that can be made to the investigation are:","completion":"- Researching and analyzing the potential challenges and limitations of implementing nuclear thermal propulsion systems, such as safety concerns, regulatory issues, and cost implications. - Investigating the potential advancements and developments in other forms of space travel, such as ion propulsion or using renewable energy sources for power. - Examining the feasibility of interstellar travel through the use of other technologies or concepts, such as warp drives or wormholes. - Considering the ethical and philosophical implications of human interstellar travel, such as the impact on other civilizations or the preservation of natural resources."},{"prompt":"опиши скелета","completion":"Скелет - это основная структура или костяная система организма, которая обеспечивает его поддержку и защиту органов.

But some educators say the real threat isn't AI, but a \\"lagging and outdated approach to education.\\" These educators say that schools can't avoid talking about ChatGPT in the classroom. As the new school year approaches, universities are scrambling to draft new policies for a post-ChatGPT classroom. Some schools have banned the tool entirely, over fears it would enable AI-assisted plagiarism. Some professors have opted to return to paper exams to fight students using ChatGPT, while one university even resorted to springing surprise checks on students suspected of using the tool. Madison White, a student at Stetson University in Florida, told The Wall Street Journal about professors' widespread fears of AI-assisted cheating. \\"They often immediately assumed that it was a hack for students to get away from doing readings or homework,\\" she said. Insider spoke to six educators at universities based in Singapore, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, and the United States. Four of them said that fears over the use of AI in classrooms were overblown, and all six said schools can't afford to shut ChatGPT out of classrooms entirely. One of them, Ian Chong, an associate professor of international relations at the National University of Singapore, said that he wasn't losing sleep about AI seeping into education. \\"I like to tell my students if they use AI to write, I'll use AI to give comments and write their recommendation letters,\\" he said. Schools shouldn't overly on AI detection tools, the educators said The concern over AI-assisted cheating has fueled a demand for tools to detect AI-generated content, but the would-be solution has introduced a new set of problems. Rebecca Tan, a political science lecturer at the National University of Singapore, told Insider AI detection tools can be \\"notoriously inaccurate.\\" As of July, plagiarism-checking software Turnitin's AI detection tool had been used to review over 65 million papers since its launch in April — despite concerns over its accuracy. Also in July, ChatGPT creator OpenAI quietly shut down its AI detection tool over concerns about its inaccuracy. Instead of relying on AI detection tools, educators need to get innovative as AI tools become ubiquitous — through ideas like having students submit the introductions to their essays first, Tan said. \\"It's short so students don't feel like they need to use ChatGPT, but it gives me a point of reference when I'm marking their longer essay to see if the final product deviates greatly from the initial introduction,\\" she said of the tactic. Educators are also rethinking how students are assessed. Chong said he's using more \\"complex, scenario-based\\" exercises with students, for which ChatGPT's responses remain inadequate. Michael Rivera, a lecturer at Hong Kong University's history department, recommends using live discussions and reflections as assessments. But, \\"pursuing such an approach is only realistic if class sizes are kept small enough to pay personal attention to everyone and provide detailed feedback throughout the school term,\\" said Shannon Ang, an assistant professor of sociology at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University, who was critical of the pressures faced by universities to expand class sizes in the name of \\"efficiency.\\" Plus, an emphasis on getting around AI might be missing the point. Schools can't afford to ignore teaching with AI Educators Insider spoke to agreed that universities shouldn't shut ChatGPT out of classrooms entirely, as ignoring the chatbot might do more harm than good. \\"What I do, for example, is to let students use AI tools to answer certain research questions, and then compare it to Wikipedia — their sort of second love in the pre-AI days — before comparing it to their textbooks,\\" said Kai Jonas, a professor of applied social psychology at Maastricht University in the Netherlands. Jonas said the key is to embrace AI tools in the classroom and teach students how to fact-check ChatGPT's responses. \\"We've already seen cases of AI generating false sources of information, and this would be a useful example to interrogate,\\" said Joana Cook, an assistant professor of political violence at Netherlands' Leiden University, currently lecturing at Johns Hopkins University. The need to vet information from AI stems from the technology's ability to \\"hallucinate,\\" or present wrong information as fact. High-profile instances of this include the technology making up fake court cases to reference — leading to a law firm receiving a 5000 fine — and retractions by media outlets over errors made by AI. The real threat to education isn't AI, it's boring lessons When asked about threats to education, Nanyang Technological University's Ang said: \\"AI tools are not the threat — a lagging and outdated approach to education is.\\" Educators who take the time to provide thoughtful feedback are likelier to see engaged students who do the work, as students understand that \\"it is pointless to receive feedback on work that is not your own,\\" said Ang. That's because using AI tools like ChatGPT as a shortcut hints at students being unengaged or swamped, and thus not seeing the value of doing the work, echoed the National University of Singapore's Tan. It takes work from professors and educators to overcome inertia and adapt to the technology while meeting students' needs, Jonas said: \\"I can see that some of them are hesitant to do so because they have to revise their curricula and teaching materials.\\" \\"I believe it is 100% the success or the failure of the teacher if students don't know how to use AI tools strategically in their education,\\" said Hong Kong University's Rivera.

It is issued by a grand jury, which is a group of citizens tasked with determining whether there is enough evidence to bring charges against the accused. An indictment initiates criminal proceedings and is a necessary step before a trial can take place. 2. Who issues an indictment? a) Judge b) Prosecutor c) Defense attorney d) Grand jury Answer: d) Grand jury Explanation: An indictment is issued by a grand jury, which is a group of citizens selected to review evidence presented by the prosecutor. The grand jury's role is to determine whether there is enough evidence to support the accusation of a crime. If the grand jury determines that sufficient evidence exists, they will issue an indictment, formally charging the accused. 3. What is the purpose of an indictment? a) To determine the guilt or innocence of the accused b) To outline the charges against the accused c) To negotiate a plea deal d) To dismiss the case before trial Answer: b) To outline the charges against the accused Explanation: The purpose of an indictment is to formally outline the charges against the accused individual. It specifies the alleged criminal behavior and provides a basis for the upcoming trial. An indictment serves to notify the accused of the specific crimes they are being charged with and allows them to prepare a defense. 4. What is the relationship between an indictment and a trial? a) An indictment automatically leads to a trial. b) An indictment is issued after a trial. c) An indictment is a necessary step before a trial can take place. d) An indictment is only used in civil cases, not criminal cases. Answer: c) An indictment is a necessary step before a trial can take place. Explanation: An indictment is a crucial step in the criminal justice process that precedes a trial. It is the formal accusation that initiates criminal proceedings against the accused. Once an indictment is issued, the case can proceed to trial, where the evidence will be evaluated, and a determination of guilt or innocence will be made."},{"prompt":"Make more MCQs involving charging and also some more MCQs involving comparing and contrasting charging with indicting.","completion":"1.

It’s content, experiences, and tools that educate the customer about how a brand’s products and solutions solve a problem, or make things easier or quicker for customers. Personal value helps customers relate to others and find common ground, or consider what others have done to solve a problem – which in turn, can help customers make a choice of their own. Or, it guides customers to the right product for an already-defined need – helping the customer feel more confident that they’re enacting their choice correctly. Catalytic value expands beyond the single customer choice or task, to target the overarching customer goal and path to goal. Catalytic digital content, tools, and experiences support self-discovery (helping the customer identify a new need or goal), self-reflection (help the customer learn something new about themselves), agency (help the customer feel in control of their decision), and affirmation (help the customer validate a choice) Of the three, catalytic value is the most powerful. A single catalytic experience doubles the likelihood of commercial outcomes like making a purchase, being willing to pay a premium, or referring other prospective customers to a brand. It is also more impactful than 100 memorable or valuable experiences (even if they are high value).","completion":"功能价值是以产品为中心的。它的内容、体验和工具可以教育客户，告诉他们品牌的产品和解决方案如何解决问题，或者如何为客户提供更加便捷和快速的服务。 个人价值帮助客户与他人产生共鸣，找到共同之处，或者考虑他人如何解决问题，从而帮助客户做出自己的选择。或者，它引导客户选择适合已定义需求的产品，从而让客户更加自信地确认他们正在做出正确的选择。 催化价值超越了单个客户的选择或任务，以目标和实现目标的路径为目标。催化式数字内容、工具和体验支持自我发现（帮助客户找到新的需求或目标）、自我反思（帮助客户了解更多关于自己的新知识）、主动性（帮助客户对自己的决策感到掌控）和肯定性（帮助客户验证自己的选择）。 在这三种价值中，催化价值是最强大的。一个催化体验可以使购买、愿意支付溢价或推荐其他潜在客户购买品牌的可能性翻倍。它也比100个令人难忘或有价值的体验更有影响力（即使它们具有很高的价值）。"},{"prompt":"explain meaning of \\" Wrong\\" Depeche Mode song","completion":"The song \\"Wrong\\" by Depeche Mode is a track from their 2009 album \\"Sounds of the Universe.\\" It was written by Martin Gore, the band's primary songwriter. The meaning behind the song \\"Wrong\\" explores the theme of guilt and the internal struggles of an individual. The lyrics suggest a sense of wrongdoing, potentially representing the inner turmoil or the personal regrets of the narrator. It reflects the feeling of being trapped in a situation or making choices that lead to undesirable consequences. The song's lyrics describe a person who feels like they are constantly making mistakes and living a life filled with wrongdoing. They express frustration with themselves and a desire to break free from their patterns of self-destruction. The phrase \\"I was born with the wrong sign, in the wrong house, with the wrong ascendancy\\" could also be interpreted as feeling born into circumstances that make it difficult to lead a fulfilling and successful life. Overall, \\"Wrong\\" touches upon the universal human experience of making mistakes and feeling remorseful, emphasizing the struggle to overcome personal failures and find redemption."},{"prompt":"modify \\" Wrong\\" Depeche Mode song to make it sound more grim and sorrowing","completion":"The song \\"Wrong\\" by Depeche Mode, a haunting ballad from their 2009 album \\"Sounds of the Universe,\\" delves into deep desolation and profound anguish. Crafted by the enigmatic Martin Gore, the band's mastermind, the song plunges us into an abyss of despair. \\"Wrong\\" unravels its meaning through an exploration of inescapable guilt and the tormented soul's internal strife. It embodies the crushing weight of remorse, depicting a protagonist trapped in a perpetual cycle of wrongdoing. The lyrics serve as a lament for a life marred by unfortunate choices and the relentless pursuit of self-destruction. Starkly introspective, the song pierces through the dormant silence, conveying the narrator's frustration and their longing for liberation from their tragic patterns. The harrowing phrase \\"I was born with the macabre sign, submerging in an ill-fated home, shackled to a cursed lineage\\" resonates with a sense of perpetual misfortune, a fate that taints every aspect of their existence. In its somber essence, \\"Wrong\\" delves into the universal experience of flawed humanity, dwelling in the shadows of our mistakes and yearning for redemption that seems elusive. It paints a poignant portrait of the human condition, where sorrow reigns supreme and a glimmer of hope becomes an ephemeral whisper amidst an abyss of darkness."},{"prompt":"根据四季 写8个字的地产宣传文案","completion":"春季和煦，与家共梦。 夏日纵情，品味尊崇。 秋色宜人，享受自然。 冬日暖心，凝聚温馨。"},{"prompt":"带上四季两个字","completion":"春暖花开，与家共梦。 夏日炎炎，尊崇生活。 秋风瑟瑟，自然享受。 冬雪飘飘，温馨凝聚。"},{"prompt":"内涵一些 高大上一些","completion":"春天如诗，与家共享梦想。 夏日浩瀚，尊崇尊贵生活。 秋风瑟瑟，自然品味高雅。 冬雪皑皑，温馨凝聚奢华。"},{"prompt":"翻译：Of course, that begs the question, should every digital engagement be “catalytic”? Maybe not. Catalytic experiences are powerful, but functional and personal value also drive commercial returns. And in fact, most brands who deliver great catalytic value, are delivering functional and personal value at the same time. For instance, a running shoe brand studied by Gartner recently launched a quiz to help customers select shoes based on their goals. The tool asks customers about their objectives and prompts self-reflection about how they run (e.g. the position of their feet and how they move, the relative pressure on knee joints). The quiz delivers catalytic value through that self-reflection, which can help customers shape new goals or a new path to the goal (i.e. a new plan for how to train for that 5k – and the realization that “the cheapest shoes I can get away with” might not be the best option). But it’s also delivering personal value: customers learn what other runners like them use or consider, and they’re guided to the right product for their needs. And it delivers some functional value as well, through education: customers learn that road shoes and trail shoes both exist, serve different outcomes and therefore, “solve” different problems. The brand can now teach customers about their products, about their product category, about what to buy and how to buy it, as well as teach customers something more about themselves, all at the same time. Great marketing helps customers make choices they feel good about, in order to do things that matter to them. Framing value and affirming value are two sides of the same coin, and within that construct, all three levels of value: functional, personal, and catalytic, are legitimate ways of generating value for customers that creates commercial value for brands. Marketers may want to reassess the balance of value they provide across digital engagements – if you’re not doing any catalytic value right now, where could you start? – but CMOs who deliver all three levels of value will fuel customer learning and confidence, and drive digital revenue growth, even in a complex, saturated digital landscape.","completion":"当然，这引发了一个问题，每一个数字化互动都应该是“催化性”的吗？也许不是。催化性的体验很强大，但实际上，功能和个人价值也推动商业回报。事实上，大多数能提供出色催化价值的品牌同时也提供功能和个人价值。 例如，最近由Gartner研究的一家跑鞋品牌推出了一项测验，帮助客户根据他们的目标选择鞋子。这个工具会询问客户他们的目标，并促使他们自省自己如何跑步（例如脚的位置和移动方式，对膝盖关节的相对压力等）。这个测验通过自省提供了催化价值，可以帮助客户制定新目标或制定新的达成目标的路径（例如为了跑5公里而制定新的训练计划-以及认识到“我能勉强完成的最便宜的鞋子”可能不是最佳选择）。 但它同时也提供了个人价值：客户了解到其他与他们相似的跑者使用或考虑的鞋子，并被引导选择适合他们需要的产品。同时，它也提供了一些功能性价值，通过教育：客户了解到路面鞋和越野鞋的存在，它们有不同的效果，因此“解决”了不同的问题。 这个品牌现在可以同时向客户教授关于他们的产品、产品类别、购买和如何购买的知识，以及向客户传授一些关于他们自己的知识。 优秀的营销帮助客户做他们感到满意的选择，以便做对他们来说重要的事情。价值框架和价值确认是同一枚硬币的两面，而在这个构建中，三种层次的价值：功能性、个人性和催化性，都是为客户创造商业价值的合法途径。 营销人员可能需要重新评估数字化互动中提供的价值平衡-如果您现在没有提供任何催化性价值，您可以从何处开始？-但是提供这三种层次的价值的首席营销官将推动客户学习和信心，并推动数字化收入增长，即使在复杂且饱和的数字化环境中也是如此。"},{"prompt":"write: Would you be able to answer the below questions as the account team need to address these answers with the customer","completion":"Certainly!

An entity class represents a persistent entity that is mapped to a database table. Hibernate uses reflection to access and persist data from the entity class. Any properties that need to be persisted should be accompanied by appropriate annotations such as @Column, @Id, @OneToOne, @OneToMany, etc. If a custom object is used as a property within an entity class, it does not necessarily need to be marked as an entity itself. Hibernate will attempt to map the properties of the custom object based on its fields or getter/setter methods. However, if the custom object is expected to be persisted in a separate table, or if it needs to participate in relationships with other entities, then it should be marked as an entity and provided with appropriate annotations. In summary, while custom objects within an entity class can be simple value objects and not necessarily entities, they might require additional annotations or mappings if they need to be persisted separately or involved in entity relationships."},{"prompt":"If there is a List in an object, should that be marked @ManyToOne or @OneToMany?","completion":"If there is a \`List\` in an object, it generally implies a one-to-many relationship between the owning entity and the elements of the list. In Hibernate, you would typically annotate such a relationship with \`@OneToMany\` on the owning entity side. For example, consider the following scenario: \`\`\`java @Entity public class ParentEntity { // ... @OneToMany(mappedBy = \\"parent\\") private List<ChildEntity> children; // getters, setters, constructors, etc. } @Entity public class ChildEntity { // ... @ManyToOne private ParentEntity parent; // getters, setters, constructors, etc. } \`\`\` Here, \`ParentEntity\` has a one-to-many relationship with \`ChildEntity\`, as there can be multiple children associated with a single parent. The \`children\` property in the \`ParentEntity\` is annotated with \`@OneToMany\` and the \`mappedBy\` attribute refers to the inverse side of the relationship (the \`parent\` property in \`ChildEntity\`). Conversely, if there was a \`List\` in the child entity representing a many-to-one relationship to a separate entity, you would mark it with \`@ManyToOne\`."},{"prompt":"Hello so i wrote a code to search for player's backpack if the specific gear is in player's backpack its gonna put it in the startergear but i forgot to search for player bacpack could you fix it?local gearStorage = game:GetService(\\"ServerStorage\\") local Players = game:GetService(\\"Players\\") print(\\"debug\\") local specificGearNames = { \\"KnightSword\\", \\"GrimAxe\\" } print(\\"debug2\\") local function onGearObtained(player, gear) for i, v in ipairs(specificGearNames) do print(i, v) -- Accessing StarterGear from Server Script local function onPlayerAdded(player) -- Wait for the StarterGear to be added local starterGear = player:WaitForChild(\\"StarterGear\\") -- Add a Tool to the StarterGear local gears = gearStorage.SpecificGears.GrimAxe:Clone() gears.Parent = starterGear end Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(onPlayerAdded) end end onGearObtained()","completion":"Sure, here is the fixed code: \`\`\`lua local gearStorage = game:GetService(\\"ServerStorage\\") local Players = game:GetService(\\"Players\\") print(\\"debug\\") local specificGearNames = { \\"KnightSword\\", \\"GrimAxe\\" } print(\\"debug2\\") local function onGearObtained(player, gear) for i, v in ipairs(specificGearNames) do print(i, v) local function onPlayerAdded(player) -- Wait for the Backpack to be added local backpack = player:WaitForChild(\\"Backpack\\") -- Check if the gear is in the player's backpack local gearInBackpack = backpack:FindFirstChild(v) if gearInBackpack then -- Access StarterGear from Server Script local starterGear = player:WaitForChild(\\"StarterGear\\") -- Add gear to StarterGear local gearClone = gearStorage.SpecificGears[v]:Clone() gearClone.Parent = starterGear end end -- Connect the event once for each specific gear Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(onPlayerAdded) end end onGearObtained() \`\`\` Note: Make sure that the gear items you want to check for exist in the \`\\"SpecificGears\\"\` folder of \`gearStorage\`."},{"prompt":"我是做lazada新加坡站点的，卖得是不锈钢地漏片，想了解下，新加坡当地还什么类似地漏需求的呢","completion":"在新加坡，除了不锈钢地漏片，还有其他类似地漏的需求。以下是一些可能的需求： 1. 浴室排水防臭器：这些设备可以防止污水反味，并保持浴室和厕所清新。它们通常安装在地漏上方，具有防臭功能。 2. 地漏沟渠：用于室外场地，例如花园、阳台或露台等。地漏沟渠可以收集雨水并将其排放到下水道中，防止场地积水。 3. 车库地坪排水系统：车库通常需要排水系统来处理车辆进入后的水和其他废物。这些排水系统通常需要地漏片来实现顺畅排水。 4. 医疗设施地漏：医院、诊所和其他医疗设施通常需要地漏来处理液体浸泡、溅出或流出。这些地漏需要具备耐酸碱、耐腐蚀等特性。 5. 餐厅或商业厨房排水系统：这些地方通常需要高效的排水系统，以处理水、油和其他废物。这些排水系统需要地漏来帮助顺畅排水，并防止堵塞。 以上只是一些可能的需求，实际上还有其他很多场合可能需要地漏。在市场研究和客户反馈中，您可以进一步了解新加坡当地对地漏的需求，以便更好地满足市场需求。"},{"prompt":"还有其他五金类需求呢","completion":"除了地漏，新加坡当地也有其他五金类需求。以下是一些可能的需求： 1. 防盗锁具：由于安全意识的增强，人们对安全门锁、窗户锁等防盗锁具的需求也在增加。 2. 门窗配件：包括门把手、拉手、铰链、门锁等门窗配件，用于家庭、办公室和商业建筑的装修和维修。 3. 管道配件：用于给水、排水、暖气和空调系统，如管道接头、弯头、法兰、阀门等。 4. 五金工具：如螺丝刀、扳手、电钻、锤子、电焊机等，用于家庭维修、建筑施工和其他工作。 5. 灯具和电气配件：包括灯泡、开关、插座、电线、电缆、电线槽等用于照明和电气设备的配件。 6. 水暖器具：包括水龙头、淋浴花洒、水槽、水泵、卫生洁具等，用于浴室、厨房和其他水暖设备。 7. 建筑五金：如锁具、门窗配件、螺丝、螺栓、铰链等，用于建筑施工和装修。 在新加坡市场中，各种五金产品的需求日益增长。通过市场调研和了解客户需求，您可以确定您的产品定位和目标受众，并设计出更好满足当地需求的产品。"},{"prompt":"how to use Noise Gator to suppress background noise.","completion":"To use Noise Gator to suppress background noise, follow these steps: 1.

Expander: The Expander filter is designed to reduce the volume of audio signals that fall below a certain threshold, effectively diminishing low-level background noise. It works by setting a threshold level below which the audio is attenuated or completely muted. This helps prevent quieter background sounds from being amplified, resulting in a cleaner and more focused audio signal. The Expander filter is particularly effective in reducing hiss, hum, or other low-level ambient noise. 2. Noise Suppression: The Noise Suppression filter in OBS utilizes a more advanced algorithm to actively analyze audio and reduce constant background noise throughout the recording or streaming process. It works by analyzing the audio frequencies and attenuating or removing noise components that remain relatively consistent. This helps to minimize continuous background noise elements such as fan noise, humming, or other persistent environmental sounds, resulting in a clearer audio signal. Both the Expander and Noise Suppression filters provided by OBS can significantly improve the quality of your audio recordings or streams by reducing unwanted background noise.

Microphone Gain/Volume Control: Adjust the microphone gain or volume levels appropriately. High gain settings can increase sensitivity, making the microphone more likely to pick up background noise. Experiment with different gain levels until you find the optimal balance between capturing your voice and minimizing background noise. 4. Noise Gates: Configure a noise gate filter in OBS. A noise gate allows you to set a threshold level below which the microphone audio is reduced or muted entirely. This means that only when you speak above a certain volume threshold will your microphone audio be transmitted, effectively reducing background noise during silent moments. 5. Noise Suppression: Enable the noise suppression filter in OBS. This filter actively analyzes the audio stream and reduces constant background noise throughout the recording or streaming session. It can help significantly in minimizing persistent ambient sounds like fan noise or electrical interference. 6. Pop Filters and Windshields: Consider using additional accessories like pop filters or foam windshields to reduce plosive sounds (such as \\"P\\" and \\"B\\" sounds) and wind noise. These accessories can help further minimize unwanted noise during your recordings. By implementing these strategies, you can significantly reduce background noise picked up by your microphone in OBS, resulting in cleaner and more focused audio recordings or streams. Experiment and fine-tune these settings to find the optimal balance for your specific microphone and recording environment."},{"prompt":"What is suppression level in OBS","completion":"In OBS (Open Broadcaster Software), the \\"Suppression Level\\" refers to the intensity or strength of the noise suppression filter applied to audio sources. The noise suppression filter analyzes the audio input and reduces or eliminates background noise to enhance the clarity and quality of the desired audio signal. The suppression level setting allows you to adjust the aggressiveness of the noise reduction applied by the filter. Higher suppression levels (closer to 100%) result in more pronounced reduction of background noise but may also impact the overall audio quality and potentially affect the desired audio signal. Lower suppression levels (closer to 0%) offer a more moderate reduction of background noise but with potentially less impact on the desired audio signal. By adjusting the suppression level in OBS, you can find a balance between effectively reducing background noise and maintaining the clarity and quality of the desired audio. It's recommended to experiment with different suppression levels and listen to the output to determine the optimal setting for your specific recording or streaming needs."},{"prompt":"Help me write a 10Gbps tool-free M.2 NVMe SSD enclosure Write an advertising slogan","completion":"\\"Unleash Lightning-Fast Speeds with our 10Gbps Tool-Free M.2 NVMe SSD Enclosure!\\""},{"prompt":"40多岁因为身体原因入住养老中心，从抖音刷到的视频，半月前前来参观，和家人充分沟通后，最终决定入住我们养老中心，一是为了减轻家庭负担，二是为了更好的康复，写一篇文案","completion":"《重拾自我，开启新篇章》 40多岁，年华已逝，却仍心怀激情；身体困顿，但信念坚定。生活对你来说，或许有些许不公，但你却不曾放弃，选择了一场新的旅程。在这个城市的某个角落，我们相遇了。 曾经，你在抖音上刷到了一段视频，而这段视频讲述的正是我们养老中心的温馨日常。这个简单的片段，点燃了你内心深处的希望火花，你产生了探寻的想法。于是，半月前，你带着憧憬，到访了我们。 参观当天，你和家人一同来到这个被绿意包围的地方。周到的服务、温暖的笑容，无不让你感受到了家的温馨。你和家人深入沟通，明确了自己的想法和愿望。最终，你做出了一个重要的决定——入住我们养老中心。 入住，对你而言，意味着更好的康复和减轻家庭负担。我们养老中心，一直秉承着提供全方位照护的理念，为每一位居民的康复旅程提供满满的支持和关怀。无论是身体还是心灵上的困扰，我们的专业团队都会倾听你的需求，为你制定个性化的康复方案。你将不再孤单，而是与众多相伴者一起共同面对，共同前行。 除了康复，我们的养老中心还提供丰富多样的活动和社交机会。你将有机会结识新朋友，分享快乐、倾听故事。在这里，你将再次感受到生活的美好，找回曾经的自己。 你的选择，源于对生活的期待和对自己的坚持。你年过半百，却敢于追寻梦想、勇敢面对挑战，这种勇气不容忽视。愿我们的养老中心成为你新生活的起点，为你的未来打开一道新的大门。 在人生的长河中，你注定是独一无二的存在。无论岁月如何变迁，打开心扉的勇气，是你与年轻人最大的共鸣。让我们携手，共同书写这个新的篇章，让你重拾自我，展开属于你的美好人生。 欢迎加入我们的大家庭，让我们一同前行，共创美好。愿你在我们养老中心，找到属于自己的幸福与快乐！"},{"prompt":"写一篇简历","completion":"个人简历 基本信息： 姓名：XX 性别：男 年龄：40岁 联系方式：手机：XXX-XXXXXXX 邮件：xxx@example.com 教育背景： 2000年-2004年 XX大学 本科 专业：XXXX 2004年-2007年 XX大学 硕士研究生 专业：XXXX 工作经历： 2007年-2010年 公司名称：XXX 职位：XXX -在负责的岗位上，积极参与项目管理和团队协作，并确保项目按时完成。 -负责与客户进行沟通和协调，解决问题并提供优质的客户服务。 -协助主管管理团队日常事务，包括人员调度、工作分配等。 2010年-2015年 公司名称：XXX 职位：XXX -担任主管职位，负责团队的组织和管理。 -制定并执行销售战略，实现公司的销售目标。 -建立并维护与客户的良好关系，提供专业的咨询和解决方案。 2016年-至今 公司名称：XXX 职位：XXX -负责项目管理，包括项目计划、资源调度、进度控制等。 -与跨部门团队合作，推动项目顺利进行。 -在项目实施过程中，及时解决问题并保证交付质量。 个人能力与特长： -具备良好的组织和管理能力，能够有效带领团队完成任务。 -出色的沟通和协调能力，能够与不同层次的人员合作。 -具备较强的问题解决能力和抗压能力，能够应对复杂的工作环境。 -熟悉项目管理流程和方法，具备一定的项目管理经验。 自我评价： 我是一名勤奋、负责、乐观的人，在工作中善于思考，并能够快速适应新的环境和任务。我具备扎实的专业知识和丰富的工作经验，注重团队合作，注重结果，能够在压力下保持良好的工作状态。我期待能够在新的工作岗位上发挥自己的才能，并与团队一起实现共同目标。 参考资料： 可提供相关工作证明和推荐信，如有需要请联系。 以上是我个人的简历，如有需要，我可以随时提供更多详情。谢谢！"},{"prompt":"您知道，高中生用什么样的字帖练字好？","completion":"对于高中生来说，选择合适的字帖练字是很重要的。以下是一些建议： 1. 标准楷书字帖：练习标准楷书是基础中的基础，能够帮助高中生打下扎实的字基。 2. 高考字帖：高中生即将面临高考，可以选择一些高考字帖进行练习，里面往往包含了高考常用字和考试要求的字体。 3. 常用字帖：选择常用字帖可以帮助高中生熟悉和掌握常用的字词，提高写作和阅读的能力。 4. 钢笔字帖：使用钢笔进行练习，可以让高中生更加注重笔画的力度和书写的规范性，同时提高书写的美感和速度。 5. 手写字帖App：现在有很多手写字帖的学习App，通过手机或平板电脑进行练字，可以有效利用碎片化时间进行练习，同时还可以纠正和指导写字姿势。 无论选择哪种字帖，高中生要坚持每天练习，注意正确的姿势和笔画顺序，逐渐提高写字的规范性和美感。"},{"prompt":"Necesito una carta larga para rose donde le decimos: Hola amor mio buenas noches. he logrado descansar luego de mi cena. realmente amo comer mucho pure de papas. fuera sido perfecto con pollo pero en fin toco acompañarlo con pescado. hay algo de lo que quiero hablar contigo y es importante. bueno como todo lo que siempre te digo. no tengo intension alguna de hablar con otra mujer, no deseo a otra mujer y si tuviera la posibilidad de estar facilmente con otra mujer tampoco lo estaria. solo estas tu en mis pensamientos y es lo unico que deseo como hombre, como pareja y como persona! es algo que queria aclarar y no quiero sembrar dudas ni que tampoco las tengas. espero te encuentres bien me gustaria saber que haz hecho en mi ausencia","completion":"y cómo has pasado estos días sin mí.

They typically work with system resources such as the network or the file system. Commands that behave differently based on external factors factors—like du or ls—have to be controlled by the test to ensure reproducibility. This post covers 3 alternatives to mocking: using aliases, functions, and PATH override. Live examples can be found in the testing-in-bash/mocking GitHub repo. To illustrate it, let’s see the improved hello function that greets users differently on Fridays. function hello() { local username=1 if [[ \\"(date +%A)\\" == \\"Friday\\" ]]; then echo \\"What a wonderful day, username!\\" else echo \\"Hello, username\\" fi } A test for this function would return different results depending on the day it’s executed. result=(hello \\"John\\") # 'result' is hard to test because it's depending on the current date To get the same results on every day the date function has to be mocked. Mocking with aliases We write articles like this regularly. Join our mailing list and let's keep in touch. Email Address In his post, Dave Nicolette recommends alias to create mocks. By default, aliases are only expanded in interactive shell sessions. In scripts, this behavior has to be explicitly enabled with the expand_aliases shell option using shopt # Enable expanding aliases in this script shopt -s expand_aliases # Set up mock alias \\"date\\"=\\"echo 'Friday';true\\" # Include the function to be tested source greeting.sh # Execute test case result=(hello \\"John\\") # result is \\"What a wonderful day, John!\\" Note that defining the mocks and sourcing the script to be tested can be done in any order, the script will use the alias over the original command. One limitation of this approach is that aliases can’t have arguments so they can only respond in one predefined way. If greeting.sh would use date in multiple places, I’d be in trouble with this approach. Also, in this concrete example, the script under test calls date +%A, but it’s impossible to narrow the alias down to these arguments and have something like alias \\"date +%A\\"=\\"...\\". Another problem is that the alias has to take care of the potential arguments that are passed to it. For example, the following simple alias would only work in the simplest case where the mock does not receive any arguments. # Setup simple alias alias \\"date\\"=\\"echo 'Friday'\\" # Without arguments, it works nicely date → Friday # But arguments are also echoed back. date +%A → Friday +%A This is obviously not ideal. I’ve added true to the alias to swallow the extra arguments. alias \\"date\\"=\\"echo 'Friday';true\\" date → Friday date +%A → Friday Mocking with function definitions For defining mocks a more robust approach is to use functions, as recommended in this post. # Include the function to be tested source greeting.sh # Set up mocks function date() { echo \\"Friday\\" } export -f date # Execute test case result=(hello \\"John\\") # result is \\"What a wonderful day, John!\\" In this case, exporting the mocks should happen after importing the script to be tested. By using functions rather than mocks all the previously mentioned problems are solved. Functions ignore additional parameters, so there’s no need to worry about the extra +%A in our case. Moreover, it’s also easy to create complex mocks that can respond in multiple ways depending on the parameters. Note: the export -f is to ensure that sub-shells can also use the mock. However, even with functions things can get complicated if a single mock function has to mock all usages for a common command, like date. This can quickly result in huge, hard-to-maintain mock code. A better practice is to refactor the original script a bit, wrap low-level commands in higher-level functions that capture part of the business domain, and simply mock that. For example, a potential improvement in the greeting.sh could be to introduce the day_of_week function. function hello() { local username=1 if [[ \\"(day_of_week)\\" == \\"Friday\\" ]]; then echo \\"What a wonderful day, username!\\" else echo \\"Hello, username\\" fi } function day_of_week() { date +%A } if [[ \\"{BASH_SOURCE[0]}\\" == \\"{0}\\" ]]; then hello \\"John\\" fi It also improves code readability since it’s much easier to figure out what date +%A does. Now it’s possible to mock day_of_week instead of date, which will result in a much simpler mock, and less chance of accidentally mocking something we’d not want to. It’s important to keep in mind that mocks can change the behavior of the tests too. For example, mocking date could very easily interfere with the tests if the test framework uses that command for reporting. Aliases and custom functions only work with unit tests. They can only override commands and functions if the code of the script file is sourced into the unit test. They have no effect when a script file is simply executed. Mocking with PATH override However, in this case, it’s still possible to mock commands by overriding the PATH variable, supplying custom executables. A similar mock with the previous functionality could be defined by creating a date executable with the following contents: #!/bin/bash echo \\"Friday\\" Such mock can be used by putting this executable to the highest precedence on PATH: export PATH=mocks:PATH result=(./greeting.sh \\"John\\") # result is \\"What a wonderful day, John!\\" The PATH based mocking provides a bit less than the alternatives. First, it only works with external executables, it does not allow mocking functions defined in the script file we are testing. Additionally, a separate file has to be maintained for each mock, which makes them separated from the test cases where they are used, thus probably harder to maintain. Also while it’s still easy to return a dummy response from such mock, it’s a bit harder to set up expectations about how the mock was called. Bonus: Mocking stdin, asserting stdout, and stderr A script might work with the stdin, stdout and stderr data streams to interact with the user. #!/bin/bash # Print question to stderr echo \\"Please enter your name:\\" >&2 # Request input from stdin read name # Print response to stdout echo \\"Hello, {name}!\\" Luckily, it’s really easy to test them using pipes and redirection. # Test that it asks for the name prompt_on_stderr=( printf \\"anyn\\" | ./greet.sh 2>&1 >/dev/null ) # prompt_on_stderr is \\"Please enter your name:\\" result=( printf \\"Johnn\\" | ./greet.sh 2>/dev/null ) # result is \\"Hello John!\\" In the first test to capture the stderr instead of stdout with command substitution I’ve redirected the stderr to the stdout, and stdout to /dev/null. In the second test where only the stdout was needed, I’ve redirected stderr to /dev/null to silence everything that comes out of the greet.sh. Also, I used printf instead of echo to explicitly control the new lines. This can come in handy if the script expects multiple lines on the stdin. Conclusion Unit testing Bash scripts can greatly enhance developer experience. Because Bash scripts are all about side effects, mocking is an important part of effective testing.

Auf der anderen Seite sind kritische Infrastrukturen Systeme und Einrichtungen, die für das Funktionieren einer Gesellschaft von entscheidender Bedeutung sind, wie Energieversorgung, Verkehrssysteme oder das Gesundheitswesen. Der Schutz dieser kritischen Infrastrukturen vor Bedrohungen und Störungen ist von großer Bedeutung, da ihr Ausfall schwerwiegende Auswirkungen auf die Gesellschaft haben kann. Die beiden Konzepte können jedoch insofern zusammenhängen, als dass die IT-Systeme, die in kritischen Infrastrukturen eingesetzt werden, ebenfalls den Anforderungen von NIS2 entsprechen müssen. Wenn diese IT-Systeme interoperabel sind und den Datenschutz- und Datensicherheitsbestimmungen entsprechen, kann dies zu einer besseren Koordination und Kommunikation zwischen den verschiedenen Elementen einer kritischen Infrastruktur führen. Insgesamt kann NIS2 dazu beitragen, die Sicherheit und Resilienz von kritischen Infrastrukturen zu verbessern, indem es Standards für die IT-Systeme festlegt, die in diesen Bereichen eingesetzt werden."},{"prompt":"welche zoll größe bei monitoren ist im Büroalltag standard?","completion":"Im Büroalltag ist die Bildschirmgröße 24 Zoll der gängigste Standard für Monitore. Diese Größe bietet in der Regel ausreichend Platz für die Anzeige von Dokumenten, Tabellen und anderen Arbeitsinhalten. Darüber hinaus ermöglicht sie eine angemessene Darstellung von Texten und Grafiken, ohne dass sie zu klein oder zu groß wirken. Natürlich gibt es auch Monitore mit kleineren oder größeren Bildschirmgrößen, je nach den individuellen Anforderungen und Präferenzen der Benutzer. Manche bevorzugen beispielsweise größere Monitore wie 27 Zoll, um mehr Informationen auf dem Bildschirm anzeigen zu können, während andere mit kleineren Bildschirmen wie 22 Zoll zufrieden sind, um Platz auf dem Schreibtisch zu sparen. Letztendlich hängt die ideale Bildschirmgröße jedoch von den spezifischen Anforderungen und Präferenzen des Büroalltags ab."},{"prompt":"gibt es große preisliche unterschiede zwischen 24 und 27 Zoll Monitoren?","completion":"Ja, es gibt in der Regel preisliche Unterschiede zwischen 24-Zoll- und 27-Zoll-Monitoren. Die Preisspanne hängt von mehreren Faktoren ab, wie zum Beispiel der Bildschirmtechnologie (z.B. LCD, LED, IPS), der Auflösung (z.B. Full HD, QHD, UHD), den Funktionen (z.B. ergonomische Einstellungsmöglichkeiten, USB-Hubs, integrierte Lautsprecher) und der Marke des Monitors. Üblicherweise sind 24-Zoll-Monitore im Vergleich zu 27-Zoll-Monitoren etwas günstiger. Dies liegt daran, dass die größeren Bildschirme in der Regel teurere Komponenten und eine höhere Auflösung erfordern. Es kann jedoch Unterschiede je nach Marke, Modell und spezifischen Funktionen geben. Zum Beispiel gibt es High-End-Modelle mit 24 Zoll, die teurer sein können als einige Einstiegsmodelle mit 27 Zoll. Es lohnt sich, verschiedene Angebote und Modelle zu vergleichen, um das beste Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis zu finden, das den individuellen Anforderungen entspricht. Es ist auch ratsam, Kundenbewertungen und Tests zu lesen, um Informationen über die Qualität und Leistung der Monitore zu erhalten, bevor eine Kaufentscheidung getroffen wird."},{"prompt":"kann man dies pauschalisieren bzw. einen prozentualen Unterschied nennen?","completion":"Es ist schwierig, einen pauschalen prozentualen Unterschied zwischen den Preisen von 24-Zoll- und 27-Zoll-Monitoren anzugeben, da dies von vielen Faktoren abhängt, wie beispielsweise der spezifischen Marke, der Modellreihe, der Bildschirmtechnologie und den zusätzlichen Funktionen des Monitors. Generell lässt sich jedoch sagen, dass 27-Zoll-Monitore tendenziell etwas teurer sind als 24-Zoll-Monitore. Dies liegt daran, dass größere Bildschirme in der Regel höhere Produktionskosten haben und möglicherweise fortschrittlichere Technologien oder Auflösungen bieten. Ein grober Richtwert könnte eine Preisdifferenz von 10-20% gegenüber einem vergleichbaren 24-Zoll-Monitor sein, aber es kann auch deutlich größere oder kleinere Unterschiede geben. Ich empfehle jedoch, die genauen Preise und Angebote mehrerer Hersteller zu vergleichen, um eine genaue Vorstellung von den tatsächlichen Preisunterschieden zu erhalten. Es ist auch wichtig, die spezifischen Anforderungen und Funktionen zu berücksichtigen, die für den Büroalltag wichtig sind, um sicherzustellen, dass der gewählte Monitor das beste Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis bietet."},{"prompt":"SourcingGuides 您必備的採購指南, please translate to English","completion":"SourcingGuides - Your essential procurement guide."},{"prompt":"出口批發集中地, please translate to English","completion":"Export Wholesale Hub"},{"prompt":"出口批發必備, please translate to English","completion":"Essential for Export Wholesale"},{"prompt":"出口批發買家必備, please translate to English","completion":"Essential for Export Wholesale Buyers"},{"prompt":"採購指南意思?","completion":"The meaning of \\"採購指南\\" in English is \\"procurement guide\\" or \\"sourcing guide.\\" It refers to a comprehensive resource or reference material that provides guidance and information on the procurement process, including sourcing suppliers, evaluating products, negotiating contracts, and managing the purchasing activities efficiently."},{"prompt":"中文","completion":"\\"採購指南\\"的意思是提供在採購過程中的指導和資訊的綜合性資源或參考資料，包括尋找供應商、評估產品、洽談合約以及有效管理採購活動等。"},{"prompt":"disk_data = { 'C:': [{'type': 'folder', 'name': '笔记', 'children': [{'type': 'file', 'name': 'Cobalt Strike工具（免杀）.md', 'size': '300KB', 'modified_time': '2021-01-01 11:00:00'}, {'type': 'folder', 'name': 'hh', 'children': [], 'modified_time': '2021-01-01 10:00:00'}, {'type': 'file', 'name': 'Java笔记.md', 'size': '300KB', 'modified_time': '2021-01-01 11:00:00'}, {'type': 'file', 'name': 'PHP笔记.md', 'size': '300KB', 'modified_time': '2021-01-01 11:00:00'}, {'type': 'file', 'name': 'Python.md', 'size': '300KB', 'modified_time': '2021-01-01 11:00:00'}, {'type': 'file', 'name': 'vulfocus复现 （自学）.md', 'size': '300KB', 'modified_time': '2021-01-01 11:00:00'}, {'type': 'file', 'name': '丁香鱼路线.md', 'size': '300KB', 'modified_time': '2021-01-01 11:00:00'}, {'type': 'file', 'name': '域渗透：Kerberos 安全.md', 'size': '300KB', 'modified_time': '2021-01-01 11:00:00'}, {'type': 'file', 'name': '安全笔记.md', 'size': '300KB', 'modified_time': '2021-01-01 11:00:00'}, {'type': 'file', 'name': '攻防世界(练习).md', 'size': '300KB', 'modified_time': '2021-01-01 11:00:00'}, {'type': 'file', 'name': '数据库.md', 'size': '300KB', 'modified_time': '2021-01-01 11:00:00'}, {'type': 'file', 'name': '问答.md', 'size': '300KB', 'modified_time': '2021-01-01 11:00:00'}]}, {'type': 'folder', 'name': 'hh', 'children': [{'type': 'file', 'name': 'Cobalt Strike工具（免杀）.md', 'size': '300KB', 'modified_time': '2021-01-01 11:00:00'}], 'modified_time': '2021-01-01 10:00:00'} ] }数据库接收到以上数据，type是类型，包括file文件和folder文件夹，name是文件或者文件夹的名字，size是文件的大小（文件夹没有大小），modified_time是文件或者文件夹的修改时间，children是文件夹里面的文件或者文件夹，以此类推。遍历实现，用tkinter显示左边页面是文件夹的树形结构（只要插入文件夹，不用插入文件），右边页面是点击左边文件夹所显示的文件夹的目录结构，（就是children里面的），包括文件夹和文件，同时要显示文件夹的修改时间和文件的大小和修改时间","completion":"您可以使用以下代码来实现遍历并在Tkinter中显示文件夹的树形结构和目录结构： \`\`\`python import tkinter as tk from tkinter import ttk def create_treeview(tree, parent, node): item = tree.insert(parent, 'end', text=node['name'], values=(node['modified_time'], '')) if node['type'] == 'folder' and 'children' in node: for child in node['children']: create_treeview(tree, item, child) def display_selected_directory(event): selected_item = tree.focus() item_values = tree.item(selected_item) children = item_values['values'] print(\\"Selected directory:\\", item_values['text']) print(\\"Modified time:\\", children[0]) # 创建主窗口 root = tk.Tk() root.title(\\"文件夹树形结构\\") # 创建一个分隔窗口 paned_window = ttk.PanedWindow(root, orient=\\"horizontal\\") paned_window.pack(fill=\\"both\\", expand=True, padx=10, pady=10) # 创建左边的Frame left_frame = ttk.Frame(paned_window) paned_window.add(left_frame, weight=1) # 创建右边的Frame right_frame = ttk.Frame(paned_window) paned_window.add(right_frame, weight=2) # 创建左边的TreeView tree = ttk.Treeview(left_frame) tree.pack(side=\\"left\\", fill=\\"y\\") # 遍历文件夹树形结构并创建TreeView for disk in disk_data.keys(): for node in disk_data[disk]: create_treeview(tree, '', node) # 添加垂直滚动条 scrollbar = ttk.Scrollbar(left_frame, orient=\\"vertical\\", command=tree.yview) scrollbar.pack(side=\\"right\\", fill=\\"y\\") tree.configure(yscrollcommand=scrollbar.set) # 添加TreeView的事件 tree.bind(\\"<<TreeviewSelect>>\\", display_selected_directory) # 运行主循环 root.mainloop() \`\`\` 此代码将创建一个Tkinter窗口，左边是文件夹的树形结构，右边是选中文件夹的目录结构。当选中一个文件夹时，会打印出文件夹的名称和修改时间。 请注意，根据您提供的数据，文件夹树形结构只会在左边的Treeview中显示文件夹（不包括文件），因此，右边的目录结构也只会显示选中文件夹中的子文件夹和文件。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

政策文件的制定是为了解决具体问题。这些文件都是为了保护黄河、渭河等河流资源，解决水资源短缺、水环境污染等问题而制定的。政策文件对问题的认知和问题解决方案进行了科学的思考和规划。 2. 政策文件的制定涉及多方利益的平衡。在保护河流资源的同时，政策文件也要考虑到农民的生产需求、经济发展的需要、环境保护的要求等各方利益。因此，政策文件要在平衡各方利益的基础上制定出可行的政策，以实现可持续发展的目标。 3. 政策文件的实施需要全社会的共同参与。河流保护涉及的范围广泛，涉及的主体众多，需要政府、企业、农民、居民等各个方面的共同努力。政策文件的实施需要在法律法规的指导下，通过宣传教育、经济手段、科技手段等多种途径，引导全社会形成合力，共同推动河流保护工作的落实。 4. 政策文件的实施需要监督和评估机制。政策文件的制定只是一个开始，其实施情况的监督和评估同样重要。只有对政策执行情况进行监督，及时发现问题并加以解决，才能确保政策的有效性和可持续性。 5. 政府要加强对政策文件的宣传和培训力度。政府应当加强对政策文件的宣传力度，提高广大公众对相关政策的了解和知晓程度；同时，还应加强对相关部门和工作人员的培训，提高其对政策内容和实施要求的理解和把握能力。只有政策的宣传和培训工作做到位，才能确保政策的顺利实施。

\`currentPointType\` 变量。 在 \`OnInspectorGUI\` 方法中，我们使用 \`PropertyDropdown\` 特性来创建一个下拉列表，通过调用 \`GetPointTypes\` 方法获取所有继承 \`PointType\` 类的类型的全名。我们还使用 \`OnValueChanged\` 特性，来在选择下拉列表值时自动调用 \`UpdatePointTypeInInspector\` 方法，来更新 \`currentPointType\` 变量的值。 最后，我们使用 \`ShowIf\` 特性来检查是否存在有效的 \`currentPointType\`，如果存在，则使用 \`InlineEditor\` 特性来在 Inspector 窗口内嵌显示该类型的编辑器。 需要注意的是，在上述的代码中，我们假设了所有的派生类都位于同一个程序集中。如果有派生类位于其他程序集中，你需要相应地修改代码来获取这些类型。

It starts with knowing what the customers want. They expect ease in their interactions In the B2B environment, customers are often dealing with complex products and services, and that’s after dealing with difficult buying journeys. In a world of one-click shopping, customers have higher expectations for any company they interact with. They want interactions to be as easy and frictionless as possible. This includes intuitive user interfaces, clear communication, and responsive support. They want quick access to information Time is of the essence. B2B buyers want immediate access to information, whether it’s product specifications, pricing, or support documentation. A well-designed FAQ section, a (helpful) chatbot, actual live chat on your website, and easily accessible customer service can fulfill this need. Your customers expect to have multiple options when contacting you when they can’t find info quickly — from live chat to email to phone calls. If you’re taking advantage of a service platform, it’s easy to manage live chat, and to quickly route leads/inquiries based on who is available. Whatever platform you’re on, don’t ignore features like these if you have them at your disposal. I’ve seen this to be true, with the excuse being that B2B buyers don’t have the same customer service needs as B2C. While that may be true in some respects, poor availability makes for a frustrating experience overall — and one that further colors the trust with the company in question. They desire a feeling of being well-informed Talk to any marketing director trying to select an automation tool and you’ll quickly realize — buyers want to feel confident in their decisions. They want to know that their decision to go with product A versus product B is a smart one and one that they can be proud of — not one that haunts their past and may put their job security in jeopardy. This requires transparent and comprehensive information from vendors. They want customer reviews, comparison tools, analytics, and detailed explanations that help them understand the value and functionality of a product or service. Too often SaaS companies especially paint a very rosy picture of what a software does, but in reality, it doesn’t measure up. I’ve seen this in promises of how one software platform may integrate with another. We’ve come to realize that the word “integration” is tossed around loosely. The buyer wants to know “how” this will work and see an example if possible. They want to avoid repetitive conversations You can probably remember a time when you’ve had to repeat your information three or four times as you got handed from request form to a bot to a rep (and then to another rep…). Or when a sales rep starts asking you questions that you already answered extensively in the lead form. How much did you still want to do business with the company after a moment like that? Nothing frustrates a customer more than having to repeat themselves. This is true when dealing with service for you automobile or changing cell phone plans. And this holds true for B2B buying — especially because most B2B buying scenarios involve anywhere from 5-10 stakeholders. Ensuring consistency in customer data across various touchpoints is vital — and this is the point to drive home when using a CRM and actually saving data in the system. Too often, teams will put sales information into a CRM but fail to add notes and details that accelerate the conversations when bringing new folks into the deal meetings. When the reasons behind these data points are emphasized, teams are more likely to utilize them. As we move into the second half of the year, I’d recommend taking time to reflect how successfully your team is syncing information across sales, support, and marketing — whether it’s a sales call, a complaint submitted, or a form filled. Each customer’s data should live in the same place.","completion":"理解现代客户体验期望 我们如何利用营销技术，不仅满足而且超越这些高期望呢？首先要知道客户想要什么。 他们希望交互变得更加简单顺畅 在B2B环境中，客户通常需要处理复杂的产品和服务，这是在面对困难的购买过程之后。在一键式购物的世界中，客户对与任何公司的互动都有更高的期望。他们希望交互变得尽可能简单和无摩擦。这包括直观的用户界面、清晰的沟通和响应迅速的支持。 他们希望快速获取信息 时间至关重要。B2B买家希望能够立即获取信息，无论是产品规格、定价还是支持文档。设计良好的常见问题解答部分、（有用的）聊天机器人、网站上的实时聊天和便于访问的客户服务可以满足这种需求。 当客户无法快速找到信息时，他们希望有多种联系您的选择，包括实时聊天、电子邮件和电话。如果您正在利用服务平台，可以轻松管理实时聊天，并根据可用人员快速转接潜在客户/查询。 无论您使用的是哪个平台，如果您有这些功能，请不要忽视它们。我亲眼见证了这一点，借口是B2B买家与B2C买家的客户服务需求不同。即使在某些方面这可能是对的，但是可用性差会导致整体上的沮丧体验，并进一步破坏对涉及公司的信任。 他们希望获得充分了解的感觉 与任何试图选择自动化工具的营销总监交谈，您很快就会意识到——买家希望对自己的决策有信心。他们希望知道选择A产品而不是B产品是明智的，并且是值得骄傲的选择，而不是一个让他们过去背负责任并可能危及他们工作安全的选择。 这需要来自供应商的透明而全面的信息。他们想要客户评价、比较工具、分析和详细的解释，以帮助他们了解产品或服务的价值和功能。太多SaaS公司特别是过于美化了软件的实际表现。我们意识到，“集成”这个词被过于随意地使用。买家想要知道“如何”工作，并且如果可能的话，看到一个示例。 他们希望避免重复的对话 你可能还记得你有过这样的经历：当你从一个请求表单被转交给一个机器人，再被转交给一个业务代表（然后转交给另一个业务代表...）时，你不得不重复你的信息三四次。或者当一个销售代表开始问你已经在潜在客户表单中详细回答过的问题时。在这种情况下，你还想与该公司做生意吗？ 没有什么比不得不重复自己更令客户沮丧的了。当您处理汽车服务或更换手机计划时，这是真实的情况。而对于B2B购买来说，情况也是如此，尤其因为大多数B2B购买场景涉及到5至10个利益相关者。 确保在各种接触点上保持客户数据的一致性至关重要，这是使用CRM系统并真正在系统中保存数据的重点。通常情况下，团队会将销售信息存入CRM系统，但未能添加备注和详细信息，以加快在引入新人时的沟通。如果强调这些数据点背后的原因，团队更有可能利用它们。 随着我们进入今年下半年，我建议花些时间思考团队在销售、支持和营销方面如何成功同步信息——无论是销售电话、提交的投诉还是填写的表单。每个客户的数据都应该存在同一个地方。"},{"prompt":"Write dialogue from a scene from the animated teen “Jane”, where 14 year old Jane, Jane’s 14 year old girlfriend Sam, Jane’s 13 year old friend Ruby and Jane’s 14 year old friend and neighbour Aaron Ling hanging out when Sam's younger sister offends Ruby and makes her cry (who is Jewish) by joking about the Holocaust, Ruby then explains to her how the Holocaust really offends and triggers her","completion":"INT.

That joke is about the Holocaust. It's not something to joke about. JANE Concerned, Jane leans towards Ruby. JANE Ruby, are you okay? RUBY (Rubbing her eyes) It's just... my grandparents were Holocaust survivors. Hearing jokes like that hurts, you know? A stunned silence fills the room. SAM (sincerely remorseful) Ruby, I didn't know. I'm sorry for Lily's joke. Lily takes a step back, now understanding the impact of her words. LILY (teary-eyed) I'm sorry, Ruby. I didn't mean to hurt you. I didn't understand. RUBY (sniffling) It's okay, Lily. Just please remember that certain topics can be really painful for people. It's important to be mindful of that. AARON (taking Lily's hand) Let's all learn from this, guys. We should be more aware of how our words can affect others, especially if they touch upon sensitive subjects. The group nods in agreement, their expressions showing empathy. JANE Thank you, Ruby, for being brave enough to share your feelings. And Lily, thank you for realizing what you said was hurtful. LILY (sincerely) I promise to be more careful with my words from now on. SAM (supportive) And we'll all be there to remind each other and support each other, right?

Tolkien) are similar in some aspects but differ in others. 1. Grammatical Function: - Ancient Greek: The aorist in Ancient Greek is a past tense that describes a completed action without indicating its duration or repetition. It can also express general truths or habitual actions. - Quenya: In Quenya, the aorist is also a past tense but is used to convey a completed, single action or event. It does not indicate habituality or general truths. 2. Verb Forms: - Ancient Greek: The aorist in Ancient Greek has different forms depending on the verb class: thematic, athematic, or irregular. It has both active and middle-passive forms. - Quenya: The aorist in Quenya is formed by adding the suffix -në to the verb stem. It does not distinguish between active and middle-passive forms. 3. Conjugation: - Ancient Greek: The aorist in Ancient Greek undergoes various stem changes, vowel contractions, or augmentations depending on the verb class. There are theme vowels (-e-, -o-) present as part of the aorist endings. - Quenya: The aorist in Quenya is relatively simple and uniform. It does not involve significant stem changes or augmentations. The verb stem is typically used as the base for conjugation. 4. Temporal Reference: - Ancient Greek: The aorist in Ancient Greek primarily expresses action that occurred in the past, without specifying the duration or repetition of the action. It can also have other temporal nuances depending on the context. - Quenya: Similar to Ancient Greek, the aorist in Quenya primarily denotes action completed in the past. It does not provide further temporal details or specify duration unless additional adverbs or context are present. 5. Usage: - Ancient Greek: The aorist in Ancient Greek is used in various contexts like narrative storytelling, historical events, general statements, and certain dependent clauses. - Quenya: In Quenya, the aorist is less frequently used compared to other tenses. It is typically employed in poetic or archaic styles of language, formal speeches, or when emphasizing a single completed action in the past. It is important to note that Quenya is a fictional language created for the purpose of Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium, while Ancient Greek is an ancient language with significant historical and cultural context. Their differences and similarities in grammatical structures and verbal tenses highlight the distinct characteristics of each language."},{"prompt":"Zenobia studiert im Master mittelalterliche französische Lyrik.

Obwohl sie ein Thema hat, das sie interessiert und bereits erste Schritte unternommen hat, könnte sie das Gefühl haben, dass sie den Ansprüchen ihrer Masterarbeit nicht gerecht werden kann. Dies könnte zu einem Gefühl der Angst, Unsicherheit oder sogar Hilflosigkeit führen. Als Reaktion darauf könnte Zenobia passiv werden, um die potenzielle Ablehnung oder Enttäuschung zu vermeiden, die mit der Fertigstellung der Arbeit verbunden sein könnte. Ein weiterer möglicher Aspekt wäre die soziale Ebene. Zenobia könnte in ihrem sozialen Umfeld oder Unterstützungssystem nicht genügend Unterstützung oder Ermutigung erhalten. Wenn sie das Gefühl hat, dass sie in ihrer Arbeit nicht genügend Rückhalt hat oder dass ihre Betreuerin nicht in der Lage ist, ihr ausreichend Orientierung oder Unterstützung zu bieten, könnte dies ihre Motivation und ihr Engagement verringern. Es ist auch möglich, dass sie sich isoliert fühlt und nicht genügend Austausch und Diskussion über ihr Thema hat, was zu einer allgemeinen Apathie führen könnte. Eine weitere Perspektive könnte die Bedürfnisebene sein. Zenobia könnte andere Bedürfnisse oder Verpflichtungen haben, die ihre Prioritäten beeinflussen. Möglicherweise kämpft sie mit persönlichen oder finanziellen Herausforderungen, die sie davon abhalten, sich auf ihre Masterarbeit zu konzentrieren. Wenn grundlegende Bedürfnisse wie Sicherheit, Stabilität oder soziale Bindungen nicht erfüllt sind, könnte es schwierig sein, sich auf intellektuelle oder akademische Aufgaben zu konzentrieren. Es ist wichtig zu betonen, dass diese Theorien auf Grundlage der angegebenen Informationen gemutmaßt werden. Um Zenobias Verhalten vollständig zu verstehen, wären eine eingehendere Analyse und persönliche Kontextinformationen erforderlich.

A rope is a binary tree where each leaf node contains a string fragment.

Then, you can easily concatenate or split these fragments as needed to perform the modifications efficiently. The rope data structure is designed to support efficient operations for substring concatenation, splitting, and modification.

While there are a number of ways to implement these ideas, I’ve spent the bulk of my career helping teams leverage a marketing platform like HubSpot to architect and deliver remarkable customer experiences. A number of platforms on the market may also have at least some of these features, or a comparable alternative, but here’s how I’d recommend moving forward if you do use the HubSpot suite of tools, but the general lessons are applicable to other platforms too. Marketing: provide relevant content In the B2B landscape, providing relevant content is key to engaging potential clients and nurturing existing relationships. Leverage your marketing platform to: Sync ads audiences. This allows for targeted advertising, ensuring that the right content reaches the right audience. Use your CRM data to create highly targeted ad campaigns and uncover valuable insight. Create multiple blogs for various audiences. By having different blogs for different segments, you can tailor content to specific needs and interests. Use a newsletter builder. A tool like this helps to create customized newsletters, providing relevant information and updates to subscribers. Set specific segmentation and lead scoring. With precise targeting and prioritization of leads, you can ensure marketing efforts are directed where they’ll have the most impact. Part of this mindset is about meeting customers on their own time, rather than interrupting them. Notice that only one of these four items is about ads: by being content-forward, you allow customers to take the next steps at their own pace, creating a more pleasant experience. The key is to balance both strategies, using outbound methods to complement and enhance the inbound approach. Speaking of outbound… Sales: ensure consistent customer experiences Consistency in customer experiences is vital for building trust and facilitating smooth transactions. From clearly defining sales rep interactions to creating a consistent way to present quotes, you can leverage your software for more reliably positive experiences. What can you do to improve sales experience consistency? Use something like HubSpot Playbooks for consistent data across reps. This ensures that all sales representatives have access to the same information, leading to uniform and consistent interactions. Use easy quoting and transacting mechanisms. Use these types of features to streamline the sales process, making it easier for customers to understand pricing and to complete transactions. Use a knowledge center to provide consistent answers. Sales reps should all be able to access a centralized knowledge base so customers aren’t given conflicting information or accidental false promises. If you use HubSpot, be sure to take advantage of the detailed segmentation capabilities in your account so you can more easily customize leads’ experiences, and ensure that sales interactions are tailored to their individual needs. Email personalization: use data points to make emails more personal Personalized emails resonate more with recipients, leading to higher engagement rates. That’s more than just a simple “Dear [NAME]”. In fact, the fake personalization (as we call that) is often more of a damaging behavior, especially if any of those fields are wrong. The moral of the story here is sending emails that are relevant to the customer based on their interests or behavior. Use the right tools to customize your emails: Contact properties. This allows for detailed profiling of contacts, enabling highly personalized email content. Segmentation, lifecycle stages, and custom properties. These features facilitate the creation of targeted email campaigns that reflect where a contact is in their buying journey. Dig deeper: From campaigns to conversations: The future of email marketing Creating remarkable customer experiences Meeting (and exceeding) customer expectations is not just about making a sale. It’s about building long-term relationships, fostering brand loyalty, and turning customers into advocates for your business. It’s about understanding that the customer experience doesn’t end with a purchase; it’s an ongoing journey that requires continuous engagement and nurturing.","completion":"满足人们的需求：将这些教训付诸实践 在牢记这一点的同时，您如何将这些原则应用于您的业务之中呢？虽然有很多实施这些理念的方式，但我在职业生涯的大部分时间里都帮助团队利用像HubSpot这样的营销平台来设计和提供出色的客户体验。市场上的许多平台也可能拥有至少一些这些功能，或者有类似的替代品，但如果您确实使用HubSpot套件的工具，那么我会推荐您按以下方式前进，但一般的教训也适用于其他平台。 市场营销：提供相关内容 在B2B领域，提供相关内容对于吸引潜在客户和培养现有关系至关重要。 利用您的市场营销平台： - 同步广告受众。这可以实现有针对性的广告投放，确保适合的内容传达给正确的受众。使用您的CRM数据创建高度针对性的广告活动，并发现有价值的洞察。 - 为不同受众创建多个博客。通过为不同的用户群体创建不同的博客，您可以根据具体需求和兴趣量身定制内容。 - 使用通讯工具。这样的工具有助于创建定制的通讯，向订阅者提供相关信息和更新。 - 设置具体的分段和线索评分。通过精准的目标定位和线索优先级设定，您可以确保营销工作的投入在最有影响力的地方。 这种思维方式的一部分是关于在顾客自己的时间里与他们接触，而不是打断他们。请注意，这四项中只有一项是关于广告的：通过内容为主导，让顾客按照自己的步调进行下一步操作，创造更愉快的体验。 关键在于平衡两种策略，利用出站方法来补充和增强入站方法。说到出站... 销售：确保一致的客户体验 在建立信任和促进顺利交易方面，一致的客户体验至关重要。从明确定义销售代表的互动方式到创建一致的报价方式，您可以利用您的软件来获得更可靠的积极体验。 您可以采取哪些措施来改善销售体验的一致性呢？ - 使用像HubSpot Playbooks这样的工具保持销售代表之间的数据一致性。这确保所有销售代表都可以访问相同的信息，从而实现统一和一致的互动。 - 使用简便的报价和交易机制。使用这类功能来简化销售过程，使客户更易于理解定价并完成交易。 - 使用知识中心提供一致的答案。销售代表都应该能够访问一个集中的知识库，以免给客户提供矛盾的信息或意外的虚假承诺。 如果您使用HubSpot，一定要充分利用您的账户中的详细细分能力，这样您就可以更轻松地定制线索的体验，并确保销售互动与他们的个体需求相适应。 电子邮件个性化：利用数据点使邮件更加个性化 个性化的电子邮件更能 reson to 被收件人接受，从而提高参与度。这不仅仅是一个简单的“尊敬的[姓名]”。实际上，我们通常称之为虚假个性化的行为更常常是具有破坏性的，尤其是如果其中的任何字段都是错误的。 这个故事的寓意是根据顾客的兴趣或行为发送相关的电子邮件。使用正确的工具来自定义您的电子邮件： - 联系属性。这允许对联系人进行详细的分析，实现高度个性化的电子邮件内容。 - 细分、生命周期阶段和自定义属性。这些功能有助于创建针对性的电子邮件活动，反映出联系人在购买旅程中的位置。 挖掘更深入：从活动到对话：电子邮件营销的未来 创建令人难以忘怀的客户体验 满足（甚至超越）客户的期望不仅仅是做一笔交易。它涉及建立长期关系，培养品牌忠诚度，将客户转化为您业务的倡导者。这并不意味着客户体验在购买后结束；它是一段持续的旅程，需要不断地参与和培养。"},{"prompt":"its work now.

Однако иногда вы можете пожелать сохранить выражение в неприведенной форме или отложить его вычисление до более позднего момента, и для этой цели может быть использован класс \`UnevaluatedExpr\`. Пример использования класса \`UnevaluatedExpr\` в SymPy: \`\`\`python from sympy import symbols, UnevaluatedExpr x, y = symbols('x y') expr = UnevaluatedExpr(x**2 + y**2) print(expr) # Output: x**2 + y**2 \`\`\` В этом примере мы создаем символьные переменные \`x\` и \`y\` с помощью функции \`symbols()\`. Затем мы создаем выражение \`x**2 + y**2\` и помечаем его как \`UnevaluatedExpr\`. При печати выражение остается в исходной форме \`x**2 + y**2\`, и SymPy не выполняет никаких операций упрощения.

My great-grandparents were Holocaust survivors. It's a part of my history, my family's pain. I can't believe she would make a joke about something so tragic. Jane and Sam exchange sympathetic glances, realizing the depth of Ruby's pain. SAM (apologetic) Ruby, we're so sorry. We didn't know she would do something like this. JANE (sincerely) Yeah, that's not okay at all. We'll have a talk with Lily and make sure she understands just how serious this is. Ruby wipes away her tears, visibly trying to compose herself. RUBY (resolute) Thank you, Jane. I appreciate your support. It's important that we educate people about why jokes like that are hurtful and offensive. AARON (nodding) Ruby's right. It's not just about her. It's about showing compassion and respect for all people and their histories. They all gather around Ruby, offering comforting hugs and reassurance. JANE (together) We're here for you, Ruby. Always. The friends embrace, united in their understanding and commitment to standing up against ignorance and promoting empathy.

There were riddles and games, it was fun.","completion":"Once upon a time, on the outskirts of a quaint little town, stood an old mansion that seemed to have jumped straight out of a storybook. With its weathered stone walls adorned with intricately carved details, and its grand windows that peered out onto a lush landscape, the mansion had an ethereal charm that whispered tales of the past. This mansion was not just a house; it was a place where my childhood unfolded, and where adventures beckoned at every turn. As I stepped through the creaking double doors, a sense of mystery and excitement filled the air. The scent of aged books and polished wood wafted through the hallways, drawing me closer to the secrets that lay within. The mansion was like a maze, with numerous rooms and corridors that whispered secrets to those who dared venture deeper. One room, in particular, held a special place in my heart - the Puzzle Parlor. Its walls were adorned with vibrant tapestries, each telling a different story. The room was filled with an air of anticipation, as riddles and games awaited to challenge and delight. I would spend hours in that room, surrounded by the tapestry of colors and the soft glow of candlelight. It was as if the room came alive, inviting me to unravel its mysteries. Riddles danced off the pages of ancient tomes and games called out to be played. Each challenge conquered led to another, as the mansion unfolded its playful allure. I remember my laughter echoing through the halls as I solved a particularly tricky riddle or triumphed in a game of strategy. The old mansion had become my mystical playground, and the memories I created within its walls were etched into my heart forever. But it wasn't just the riddles and games that made my childhood in the old mansion special. It was the people who were drawn to its enchanting embrace. Friends and family would gather in its timeless halls, their laughter weaving into the very fabric of the house's history. The mansion became a sanctuary, a place where imaginations soared and hearts were set free. It nurtured our creativity and brought out the child in all of us, even the grown-ups. It was a place where joy was contagious, and we reveled in the magical atmosphere that seemed to permeate every inch of its grandeur. As the years passed, and life led me away from the childhood haven that was the old mansion, I carried with me the warmth of those cherished memories. The riddles and games had taught me the value of perseverance and the thrill of discovery. And the mansion itself had gifted me a glimpse into a world where wonder and laughter knew no bounds. Now, as I look back on those days, I am filled with a deep gratitude for the old mansion and the experiences it offered. For it was within its walls that my childhood blossomed, and where dreams were invited to dance under the moonlit sky."},{"prompt":"将下面这段话描述的更详细。另外，我也报名参加了全国大学生实验竞赛（教学赛），这让我有机会与来自全国各高校的优秀大学生们进行交流和切磋。在比赛的现场，我和他们分享了自己的学习心得和经验，也从他们那里学到了很多新的思路和方法。这次经历让我突破了自我，提高了自己的专业能力，并且见识到了其他优秀同学们的丰富的知识储备和实验能力，这对我来说是一次很宝贵的学习机会。","completion":"我非常幸运地报名参加了全国大学生实验竞赛（教学赛），这是一个能够让来自全国各高校的优秀大学生们进行交流和切磋的机会。在比赛的现场，我与与会者分享了自己的学习心得和经验，也从他们那里学到了很多新的思路和方法。我们在这个激烈的竞争环境中一起展示自己的实验成果和技能，并互相提供反馈和建议。 这次参赛经历让我更加意识到自己的学术能力的不足之处并有了进一步的提高。通过和其他优秀同学切磋和交流，我深刻理解到了学习和实验的重要性，并且对如何提高专业能力有了更加全面的认识。他们的丰富的知识储备和实验能力让我受益匪浅，这对我来说是一次非常宝贵的学习机会。 总的来说，参加全国大学生实验竞赛给了我一个与来自全国各高校的优秀大学生们交流和切磋的平台，我通过分享自己的学习心得和经验，以及从他们那里学习到的新的思路和方法，不仅提高了自己的专业能力，也扩展了自己的学术圈子。这次经历对我来说意义重大，是一次难得的学习和成长的机会。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Если вы хотите, чтобы Docker всегда выполнял определенный шаг сборки, даже если нет изменений в соответствующих файловых системах контекста сборки, вы можете использовать директиву \`--no-cache\` в команде \`docker build\`. Ниже приведены два способа использования \`--no-cache\` в команде \`docker build\`: 1. Команда \`docker build\` с флагом \`--no-cache\` для сборки образа Docker из Dockerfile: \`\`\`shell docker build --no-cache -t my-image:latest . \`\`\` 2.

It is crucial to understand these sources to effectively manage stress and maintain overall well-being. This article will discuss five significant sources of stress: work-related stress, financial stress, relationship stress, health-related stress, and environmental stress. One of the most common sources of stress is work-related stress. A demanding workload, tight deadlines, long hours, and high levels of responsibility can all contribute to stress in the workplace. Additionally, conflicts with colleagues or superiors, lack of control over one's work, and unclear expectations can also lead to stress. Furthermore, job insecurity and fear of unemployment can generate significant stress levels and affect an individual's mental and emotional health. Financial stress is another significant contributor to overall stress levels. Money-related worries such as debt, unemployment, lack of savings, and the inability to meet financial obligations can cause immense stress. The uncertainty about future financial stability can create anxiety, tension, and impact an individual's mental well-being. Meeting daily expenses, managing mortgages or rent, and providing for the needs of oneself and family can all contribute to financial stress. Relationship stress is a common source of stress that arises from conflicts, disagreements, and difficulties in personal and professional relationships. Problems in romantic relationships, family conflicts, conflicts at work, and difficulties in friendships can all generate stress. Poor communication, lack of trust, inability to resolve conflicts, and feeling unsupported or misunderstood are all factors contributing to relationship stress. Health-related stress is another significant stressor that can affect individuals. Physical health concerns, chronic illnesses, injuries, or disabilities can all lead to stress. The fear of illness, undergoing medical treatments, managing pain, and adjusting to changes in physical ability can all generate stress. Additionally, mental health issues such as anxiety and depression can also lead to stress and impact an individual's overall well-being. Environmental stress is a source of stress that arises from situations or events in the external environment. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, or fires, can generate stress due to the loss of property, displacement, or fear for one's safety. Additionally, noise pollution, overcrowding, traffic, or lack of green spaces can all contribute to environmental stress. The constant exposure to stressful environmental factors can affect one's mental health and contribute to overall stress levels. It is important to note that these sources of stress are interconnected, and one source of stress can often lead to or exacerbate another. For example, financial stress can cause relationship stress, and relationship stress can lead to work-related stress. Similarly, health issues can affect an individual's financial and relationship stress levels. Understanding the different sources of stress is essential for developing effective stress management strategies. These strategies may include relaxation techniques, practicing self-care, seeking social support, setting boundaries, and seeking professional help when needed. By recognizing and addressing the sources of stress, individuals can work towards improving their overall well-being and reducing the negative impact of stress on their lives."},{"prompt":"Explain the Process of Communication?in 520 words","completion":"Communication is the process through which individuals exchange information, ideas, feelings, and thoughts with one another. It is a fundamental aspect of human interaction and plays a crucial role in various personal, social, and professional contexts. The process of communication involves several key components, including the sender, message, channel, receiver, feedback, and context. The first component of the communication process is the sender. The sender is the person initiating the communication and formulating the message to be conveyed. They encode their thoughts, ideas, or feelings into a message that can be understood by the intended recipient. The sender must consider various factors like language, tone, and non-verbal cues when encoding the message to ensure effective communication. The second component is the message itself. The message is the information or content that the sender wants to transmit to the receiver. It can be conveyed through various means, including verbal communication (spoken or written words), non-verbal cues (facial expressions, body language), or visual aids (images, graphs, videos). The message needs to be clear, concise, and coherent to facilitate effective understanding by the receiver. The third component is the channel of communication. The channel refers to the medium or mode through which the message is transmitted from the sender to the receiver. It can be face-to-face conversations, phone calls, emails, texts, video calls, or any other form of communication that allows information to be shared. The choice of channel depends on factors like the nature of the message, the urgency of communication, and the preferences of both the sender and the receiver. The next component is the receiver. The receiver is the person or audience to whom the message is directed. Their role is to decode the message received from the sender, interpreting and making sense of its content. The receiver's understanding may be influenced by factors such as their knowledge, experiences, cultural background, and ability to pay attention and focus on the message. Feedback plays a crucial role in the communication process. It is the response or reaction of the receiver to the message conveyed by the sender. Feedback can be verbal, non-verbal, or a combination of both. It helps the sender gauge the effectiveness of their message and allows the receiver to clarify any doubts or seek further information. Feedback is essential for ensuring that the communication process is complete and successful. Lastly, the context of communication is an important component. The context refers to the circumstances, environment, or situation in which the communication takes place. It includes factors like the physical setting, cultural norms, social dynamics, and the relationship between the sender and receiver. The context influences both the sender's message formulation and the receiver's interpretation, as it can shape the meaning and impact of communication. The process of communication is dynamic and continuous. It involves constant interaction and exchange between the sender and receiver. Effective communication requires clarity, active listening, empathy, respect, and adaptation to the needs and preferences of the individuals involved. By understanding and actively participating in the communication process, individuals can enhance their ability to convey their ideas, understand others, and build stronger connections in various personal and professional settings."},{"prompt":"Types of stress.in 110 words","completion":"There are several types of stress that individuals may experience. 1.

The example above assumes a dynamic loading scenario using the \`dlopen\` and \`dlclose\` functions from the POSIX API."}]`),j={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},q={class:"search-container"},D={class:"card-container"},H={key:0,class:"empty-state"},E=["disabled"],_={key:0},B={key:1};function W(n,e,l,m,o,r){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",q,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):d("",!0)]),t("div",D,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(r.displayedPoems,(s,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",H,' No results found for "'+c(o.searchQuery)+'".
